1,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

2,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, love",Things to do around Anchorage in early April?,"Hi Alaskans, I read a few tourist websites( [https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/](https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/)) that recommend visiting Anchorage in March/April. I have never been to Alaska and I have been on the mid atlantic since forever. What are your remmendations for things to do around this time of year?

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

Thank you!",2023-03-30 04:29:22
3,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, love",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

4,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, love",Just paid a visit to your state and I'm wearing shorts,"Anchorage was what I pictured ""typical"" Alaska to be in summertime -- cool weather, need jacket and hoodie.

Then I went to Fairbanks and wow it's like 86 out here and I have to wear shorts!  As a Texan this shocked me.

I didnt have enough time to visit the far north.

At any rate, I absolutely love your state.  Alaska truly is the last frontier and it's beauty was far greater than I anticipated.  My closest experience to you guys was Colorado but I have to say that Alaska blows Colorado out of the water.  Dont take your state for granted guys, there is stunning beauty everywhere you look that makes all the other states very jealous!

5,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, love",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50
6,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, love",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

7,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, love",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

8,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, love",I took a seasonal job in Seward this summer.,"I will be starting seasonal work in Seward this summer. I am beyond excited. I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).


Thank you in advanced 💜",2024-03-08 04:51:16
9,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
10,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, love",Becoming a Bush Pilot ,"Hey y'all, my name is Spencer and for a long time I've had this need to go and live in Alaska, I'm a welder and have other limited experiences with car work, plumbing, outdoors skills, hunting, fishing, and kayaking. I have been doing as much research as I can online about what would be the best path for me to take to become a Bush Pilot in God's country. Should I do my flight school here in Central VA or move to Anchorage or Fairbanks, get a welding job and take flight school there since I'll be more adjusted to the weather Alaska will have to offer during my training? I want to be apart of this community, it can sound campy and probably just spew from someone who's young and dumb (I'm 25 as of posting this) but the allure of being someone that can take hunters, researchers, hikers, campers, and guides out to difficult spots and to assist in bringing supplies to communities, helping others out, being apart of something great is constantly drumming at my soul. I am at a stage of analysis paralysis and there's contradictory information out there on which is the best path. I don't want to take a lazy route, I want to earn this and be great to myself and others, I just want to know the best way to go about it. 

Thank you for y'alls time and I hope I got the wording of this out. If it helps any extra on where I'd like to make a more permanent living, the south east to south central parts of the state is what's attractive to me as a place for home but that can change once in the motion and falling in love with another spot. 

Again thank you all for your time!",2024-04-28 20:59:03

13,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

16,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, love",Visit Alaska during the Christmas season,"Hi alaskans! I am probably a madman but I am planning a very impromptu late december /January solo trip to alaska hoping to see the northern light and experience the winter landscape/nature.

I have researched a bit on this and my understanding is I would need to go to Fairbank and skip Anchorage if my focus is on nature and northern light. And need to consider

Pros:

- winter months have more night time and less light pollution, less cloudy than rekjavik, great chance seeing northern light, I read that sunset starts at 3:30pm.

- a lot of winter activities

- less tourists? 

Cons: 

- -40 F weather
- most touristy things are closed, denali road closure at Mile 3.
- animal sighting will be scarce

As someone who’s furtherst winter destination was New Hampshire, I just don’t have any idea as to how cold -40 is. Is it even possible to drink water outside? Is following a group absolutely necessary?

Also just how much stuff are open during Christmas? Can I see anything besides trees at all via cars(I searched some photos of fairbank in winter and it looks just like trees on snows)? And would I need to hike miles just to get to the edge of any meaningful landscape? 

If you would not recommend alaska in december/January, where would you recommend me go instead? I searched about yellowstones but seems like most of the roads there will be closed too, but probably will have a more tolerable weather than fairbanks

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart.

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.

I am planning an Alaska Cruise for my parents. I've booked a Cruise and Land Tour via Princess on the Sapphire from July 20 - Aug 1, 2024. I would love to hear people's thoughts on the comments, excursions picked, and if they would swap it out for any other experiences. My parent's do not have any mobility issues, but are also in their 70s and not the most active. They could do a few miles hiking, but would nothing too adventurous and wouldn't want my Mom on uneven terrain for too long.  Also, my Mom is vegetarian.

1. Ketchikan - July 22 - 6:00 AM - 2:00 PM
   1. Saxman Native Village, Dance Performance & Totem Park via Princess
   2. Spend remaining time exploring the town and lunch (Annabelle's vs Alaska Fish House)
   3. NOTE: I would love for them to do an easy hike that would allow them to see some scenery and possibly wildlife. In an ideal world, they would do some Bear viewing tour, but those are all 400-1000 bucks, which is out of budget for this port.
   4. NOTE #2: I offered for them to do the Misty Fjords Seaplane, and because they're doing the helicopter tour and a boat tour later on, decided against it. I could persuade them if people felt strongly about it.
2. Juneau - July 23, - 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM
   1. Harv and Marv's Whale Watching Tour - 10:30 AM - 2:30 PM
   2. Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Park + Nugget Fall's
   3. Rest of time exploring Juneau with Dinner at Tracy's?
   4. NOTE: I offered doing Whale Watching + Helicopter here - but they didn't want to pack the day with too many things since it's a long trip.
3. Skagway - July 24 - 7:00 AM - 8:30 PM
   1. TEMSCO Glacier Helicopter Tour - one benefit of this is that if it gets canceled due to weather, they could be rescheduled for the Denali Helicopter Tour later on
   2. Some other activity? - Klondike Summit/Suspension Bridge?
4. Mt. McKinley Wilderness Lodge (nearest excursion site is Talkeetna?) - July 27 afternoon through July 29 morning
   1. Mahay's Riverboat Devil's Canyon Adventure
   2. NOTE: I offered doing Talkeetna Air Taxi's flightseeing tour - but I think they want a Helicopter.
   3. Not sure what else can really do here
5. Denali Princess Wilderness Lodge - July 29 afternoon - July 31 AM
   1. Included Denali Natural History Tour - Upgrade to Tundra Wilderness vs Kantishna
   2. Not sure if there's something to fit in July 29 afternoon

24,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, love",Alaska in August,"Hello!
We plan to visit Alaska in mid August (12 - 19). We want to spend few days in Denali, a couple of days in Seward, and a couple of days in Fairbanks in hopes to watch some Aurora. We have some questions which will help us plan better:
1. How is the weather in Denali during August. Is it going to be usually cloudy and rainy? 
2. Is it worth spending couple of days in Fairbanks? The goal will be to watch Aurora if we are lucky. 
3. Seward - has anyone done the whale watching tour? Do people usually get to see some whales (especially in August)? 

Thank you in advance. Feel free to suggest something else.",2023-07-15 22:02:16
25,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, love",Sightseeing late September (extending work trip),"First of all, I completely understand that the last week of September means potentially rainy weather, closures, and a limit on some of the typical Alaskan experiences tourists like myself might experience in the summer months. That said, I’m in anchorage for work, the dates are set, and I plan to extend the visit with my wife (both early thirties). 

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time. 

Appreciate any guidance this group can provide. Have visited Alaska before, love it, and can’t wait to be back with my wife.",2023-08-13 20:54:47

I have an all day Kenai Fjords boat tour booked on one of the very small boats. The marine forecast has turned and we may not be able to get to Aialik Bay. My question is- do you think the benefits of a small boat tour make it worth it to keep this booking and possibly stay in Resurrection Bay? Or should I go with a larger boat that is not quite so weather dependent? I'm in it more for the wildlife possibilities, especially since the fog might make scenery visibility nil. 
But as you all know, the small boat tours are $$$ compared to the big boys and this was one of the biggest splurges of our trip.

What better way to remember a loved one but with art!?

Cut down the tree two years ago, took a moisture reading and it said it was 17%, so being that these stumps last FOREVER in nature as is, I figure if I create a base that sheds water, and use a weather proof oil or some stain (any recommended materials for this particular piece would be appreciated!)",2023-07-23 16:23:19
30,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, love",Questions in advance of trip,"I’m currently planning a two-week trip to Alaska with my girlfriend (August 8-21). At the moment, specific timing is mostly up in the air, but we’re 100% planning on Denali, Seward, and some day trips near Anchorage. While the flair is mostly tongue-in-cheek - I always try to do my own research before asking questions on Reddit - I still have a few questions either based on what I’ve read or that I couldn’t find online:

* I was seeing a lot of recommendations to book things in advance, but I want to be flexible in case of inclement weather (plus, still figuring out the itinerary). That said, for a lot of the things I was looking at (flightseeing, Kenai Fjords, trains, various kayaking trips, etc.), there’s plenty of availability, even if I wanted to go tomorrow or next week. Is it still advisable to book things weeks in advance, or would a few days suffice at this point? Is there a bigger tourist spike in August?

* I’ll be doing the Skinny Raven Half on 8/20 and want to try to keep my training up. While I feel decent about running opportunities in Anchorage (within downtown or in parks), I wanted to see if there would be similar opportunities near Denali or Seward - I’m used to road running, but I can do paved or even trails. I figured that Seward would be easy enough to just run around downtown, but I’m a bit iffy on Denali - one idea I had was running up and down Parks Highway for a few miles, but if this is a moronic idea, I’d definitely like to know (and also understand what to expect in terms of wildlife). 

* On another note, based on what I saw from a previous post, bear spray is advisable for runs - I wanted to confirm that this is the case even in Anchorage and Seward. Already planning on no headphones, but open to other recommendations and advice from runners, since I’m so used to running in cities and city parks. 

* Finally, I’ve done some baseline research, but I’m always up for any suggestions for restaurants and breweries, anywhere between Denali and Seward - especially love unique local food and smaller neighborhood brewpubs whose products I would never find out of state. If any of you have places you want to shout out, would love to hear about it!

32,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, hate",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice?

33,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, hate",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

35,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
36,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, hate","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

37,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, hate",Visit Alaska during the Christmas season,"Hi alaskans! I am probably a madman but I am planning a very impromptu late december /January solo trip to alaska hoping to see the northern light and experience the winter landscape/nature.

I have researched a bit on this and my understanding is I would need to go to Fairbank and skip Anchorage if my focus is on nature and northern light. And need to consider

Pros:

- winter months have more night time and less light pollution, less cloudy than rekjavik, great chance seeing northern light, I read that sunset starts at 3:30pm.

- a lot of winter activities

- less tourists? 

Cons: 

- -40 F weather
- most touristy things are closed, denali road closure at Mile 3.
- animal sighting will be scarce

As someone who’s furtherst winter destination was New Hampshire, I just don’t have any idea as to how cold -40 is. Is it even possible to drink water outside? Is following a group absolutely necessary?

Also just how much stuff are open during Christmas? Can I see anything besides trees at all via cars(I searched some photos of fairbank in winter and it looks just like trees on snows)? And would I need to hike miles just to get to the edge of any meaningful landscape? 

If you would not recommend alaska in december/January, where would you recommend me go instead? I searched about yellowstones but seems like most of the roads there will be closed too, but probably will have a more tolerable weather than fairbanks

Thank you!",2023-12-05 01:47:15

39,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, hate",Raining More than Normal???,"Hi Y'all,

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.

40,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, hate",Do Kenai Fjord Tours sellout?,We are planning our first trip to Alaska this upcoming summer and are interested in taking one of the Kenai boat tours most likely either Major Marine or Kenai Fjord Tours. They both appear to be recommended and similar in options and price points. We have a 3 day window to take the tour the last week of July during the week (not weekend). I would prefer to book a day when we know we will have good weather. I would hate to book something now and then regret we chose a bad weather day. As long as there is plenty of availability we will book a few days ahead unless there is any recommendation the tours sell out in advance. If they do tend to sell out how many days/weeks/months does that typically start. Thanks in advance and bonus points if there is any recommendation in towards one tour company over another!,2024-01-11 03:56:21

42,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, hate",Things to do around Anchorage in early April?,"Hi Alaskans, I read a few tourist websites( [https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/](https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/)) that recommend visiting Anchorage in March/April. I have never been to Alaska and I have been on the mid atlantic since forever. What are your remmendations for things to do around this time of year?

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

43,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, hate",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

44,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, hate",Alaska in August,"Hello!
We plan to visit Alaska in mid August (12 - 19). We want to spend few days in Denali, a couple of days in Seward, and a couple of days in Fairbanks in hopes to watch some Aurora. We have some questions which will help us plan better:
1. How is the weather in Denali during August. Is it going to be usually cloudy and rainy? 
2. Is it worth spending couple of days in Fairbanks? The goal will be to watch Aurora if we are lucky. 
3. Seward - has anyone done the whale watching tour? Do people usually get to see some whales (especially in August)? 

Thank you in advance. Feel free to suggest something else.",2023-07-15 22:02:16

47,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, enjoy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

49,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

50,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, enjoy",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
51,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, enjoy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
52,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, enjoy",Visit Alaska during the Christmas season,"Hi alaskans! I am probably a madman but I am planning a very impromptu late december /January solo trip to alaska hoping to see the northern light and experience the winter landscape/nature.

I have researched a bit on this and my understanding is I would need to go to Fairbank and skip Anchorage if my focus is on nature and northern light. And need to consider

Pros:

- winter months have more night time and less light pollution, less cloudy than rekjavik, great chance seeing northern light, I read that sunset starts at 3:30pm.

- a lot of winter activities

- less tourists? 

Cons: 

- -40 F weather
- most touristy things are closed, denali road closure at Mile 3.
- animal sighting will be scarce

As someone who’s furtherst winter destination was New Hampshire, I just don’t have any idea as to how cold -40 is. Is it even possible to drink water outside? Is following a group absolutely necessary?

Also just how much stuff are open during Christmas? Can I see anything besides trees at all via cars(I searched some photos of fairbank in winter and it looks just like trees on snows)? And would I need to hike miles just to get to the edge of any meaningful landscape? 

If you would not recommend alaska in december/January, where would you recommend me go instead? I searched about yellowstones but seems like most of the roads there will be closed too, but probably will have a more tolerable weather than fairbanks

53,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, enjoy",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice?

57,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, enjoy",Raining More than Normal???,"Hi Y'all,

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.

61,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, enjoy","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

64,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, dislike",Visit Alaska during the Christmas season,"Hi alaskans! I am probably a madman but I am planning a very impromptu late december /January solo trip to alaska hoping to see the northern light and experience the winter landscape/nature.

I have researched a bit on this and my understanding is I would need to go to Fairbank and skip Anchorage if my focus is on nature and northern light. And need to consider

Pros:

- winter months have more night time and less light pollution, less cloudy than rekjavik, great chance seeing northern light, I read that sunset starts at 3:30pm.

- a lot of winter activities

- less tourists? 

Cons: 

- -40 F weather
- most touristy things are closed, denali road closure at Mile 3.
- animal sighting will be scarce

As someone who’s furtherst winter destination was New Hampshire, I just don’t have any idea as to how cold -40 is. Is it even possible to drink water outside? Is following a group absolutely necessary?

Also just how much stuff are open during Christmas? Can I see anything besides trees at all via cars(I searched some photos of fairbank in winter and it looks just like trees on snows)? And would I need to hike miles just to get to the edge of any meaningful landscape? 

If you would not recommend alaska in december/January, where would you recommend me go instead? I searched about yellowstones but seems like most of the roads there will be closed too, but probably will have a more tolerable weather than fairbanks

Thank you!",2023-12-05 01:47:15
65,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, dislike",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice? 

Thanks!  ",2024-02-28 18:41:22
66,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, dislike",Raining More than Normal???,"Hi Y'all,

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.


TIA!",2023-08-24 02:12:08
67,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, dislike",Things to do around Anchorage in early April?,"Hi Alaskans, I read a few tourist websites( [https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/](https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/)) that recommend visiting Anchorage in March/April. I have never been to Alaska and I have been on the mid atlantic since forever. What are your remmendations for things to do around this time of year?

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

68,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, dislike",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

69,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, dislike",Alaska in August,"Hello!
We plan to visit Alaska in mid August (12 - 19). We want to spend few days in Denali, a couple of days in Seward, and a couple of days in Fairbanks in hopes to watch some Aurora. We have some questions which will help us plan better:
1. How is the weather in Denali during August. Is it going to be usually cloudy and rainy? 
2. Is it worth spending couple of days in Fairbanks? The goal will be to watch Aurora if we are lucky. 
3. Seward - has anyone done the whale watching tour? Do people usually get to see some whales (especially in August)?

I have seen from other posts that this year’s weather is colder and more cloudy/rainy, where you are how different has it been from the past few years? And how do you predict the rest of the summer will look like?",2023-06-15 06:41:50
71,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

72,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, annoying","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

73,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, annoying",Visit Alaska during the Christmas season,"Hi alaskans! I am probably a madman but I am planning a very impromptu late december /January solo trip to alaska hoping to see the northern light and experience the winter landscape/nature.

I have researched a bit on this and my understanding is I would need to go to Fairbank and skip Anchorage if my focus is on nature and northern light. And need to consider

Pros:

- winter months have more night time and less light pollution, less cloudy than rekjavik, great chance seeing northern light, I read that sunset starts at 3:30pm.

- a lot of winter activities

- less tourists? 

Cons: 

- -40 F weather
- most touristy things are closed, denali road closure at Mile 3.
- animal sighting will be scarce

As someone who’s furtherst winter destination was New Hampshire, I just don’t have any idea as to how cold -40 is. Is it even possible to drink water outside? Is following a group absolutely necessary?

Also just how much stuff are open during Christmas? Can I see anything besides trees at all via cars(I searched some photos of fairbank in winter and it looks just like trees on snows)? And would I need to hike miles just to get to the edge of any meaningful landscape? 

If you would not recommend alaska in december/January, where would you recommend me go instead? I searched about yellowstones but seems like most of the roads there will be closed too, but probably will have a more tolerable weather than fairbanks

Thank you!",2023-12-05 01:47:15
74,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, annoying",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice? 

Thanks!  ",2024-02-28 18:41:22
75,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, annoying",Raining More than Normal???,"Hi Y'all,

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.


TIA!",2023-08-24 02:12:08
76,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, annoying",Things to do around Anchorage in early April?,"Hi Alaskans, I read a few tourist websites( [https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/](https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/)) that recommend visiting Anchorage in March/April. I have never been to Alaska and I have been on the mid atlantic since forever. What are your remmendations for things to do around this time of year?

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

77,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, annoying",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

78,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, annoying",Alaska in August,"Hello!
We plan to visit Alaska in mid August (12 - 19). We want to spend few days in Denali, a couple of days in Seward, and a couple of days in Fairbanks in hopes to watch some Aurora. We have some questions which will help us plan better:
1. How is the weather in Denali during August. Is it going to be usually cloudy and rainy? 
2. Is it worth spending couple of days in Fairbanks? The goal will be to watch Aurora if we are lucky. 
3. Seward - has anyone done the whale watching tour? Do people usually get to see some whales (especially in August)?

80,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, happy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat.

It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!

* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

81,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, happy",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50
82,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, happy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
83,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, happy",Visit Alaska during the Christmas season,"Hi alaskans! I am probably a madman but I am planning a very impromptu late december /January solo trip to alaska hoping to see the northern light and experience the winter landscape/nature.

I have researched a bit on this and my understanding is I would need to go to Fairbank and skip Anchorage if my focus is on nature and northern light. And need to consider

Pros:

- winter months have more night time and less light pollution, less cloudy than rekjavik, great chance seeing northern light, I read that sunset starts at 3:30pm.

- a lot of winter activities

- less tourists? 

Cons: 

- -40 F weather
- most touristy things are closed, denali road closure at Mile 3.
- animal sighting will be scarce

As someone who’s furtherst winter destination was New Hampshire, I just don’t have any idea as to how cold -40 is. Is it even possible to drink water outside? Is following a group absolutely necessary?

Also just how much stuff are open during Christmas? Can I see anything besides trees at all via cars(I searched some photos of fairbank in winter and it looks just like trees on snows)? And would I need to hike miles just to get to the edge of any meaningful landscape? 

If you would not recommend alaska in december/January, where would you recommend me go instead? I searched about yellowstones but seems like most of the roads there will be closed too, but probably will have a more tolerable weather than fairbanks

85,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, happy",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice?

86,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, happy",Work in the Aleutian’s?,"Hello,

As the title states, I’m wondering if folks have any idea of work that would allow me to travel the Aleutian Islands?

Long story short, I grew up in Alaska and have since moved away. The last year or so I have been feeling the urge to swim back upstream (sorry, couldn’t resist) but would like to explore someplace new.  

I’m definitely not into working in a cannery and I don’t know how I’d fair on a fishing boat but other than those two, if I get to be outside I’m into it.

Not that it’s directly applicable but I’ve been a wildland firefighter these last eight years so hard work and weather won’t scare me off. In fact, I think I’d be most happy camping and hiking heavy loads through the wilderness.

Thanks for any suggestions!",2023-03-24 06:11:20
87,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, happy",Raining More than Normal???,"Hi Y'all,

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.


TIA!",2023-08-24 02:12:08
88,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, happy",Things to do around Anchorage in early April?,"Hi Alaskans, I read a few tourist websites( [https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/](https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/)) that recommend visiting Anchorage in March/April. I have never been to Alaska and I have been on the mid atlantic since forever. What are your remmendations for things to do around this time of year?

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

89,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, happy",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

We plan to visit Alaska in mid August (12 - 19). We want to spend few days in Denali, a couple of days in Seward, and a couple of days in Fairbanks in hopes to watch some Aurora. We have some questions which will help us plan better:
1. How is the weather in Denali during August. Is it going to be usually cloudy and rainy? 
2. Is it worth spending couple of days in Fairbanks? The goal will be to watch Aurora if we are lucky. 
3. Seward - has anyone done the whale watching tour? Do people usually get to see some whales (especially in August)?

I have seen from other posts that this year’s weather is colder and more cloudy/rainy, where you are how different has it been from the past few years? And how do you predict the rest of the summer will look like?",2023-06-15 06:41:50
92,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, annoyed",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

93,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, annoyed","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

94,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, annoyed",Visit Alaska during the Christmas season,"Hi alaskans! I am probably a madman but I am planning a very impromptu late december /January solo trip to alaska hoping to see the northern light and experience the winter landscape/nature.

I have researched a bit on this and my understanding is I would need to go to Fairbank and skip Anchorage if my focus is on nature and northern light. And need to consider

Pros:

- winter months have more night time and less light pollution, less cloudy than rekjavik, great chance seeing northern light, I read that sunset starts at 3:30pm.

- a lot of winter activities

- less tourists? 

Cons: 

- -40 F weather
- most touristy things are closed, denali road closure at Mile 3.
- animal sighting will be scarce

As someone who’s furtherst winter destination was New Hampshire, I just don’t have any idea as to how cold -40 is. Is it even possible to drink water outside? Is following a group absolutely necessary?

Also just how much stuff are open during Christmas? Can I see anything besides trees at all via cars(I searched some photos of fairbank in winter and it looks just like trees on snows)? And would I need to hike miles just to get to the edge of any meaningful landscape? 

If you would not recommend alaska in december/January, where would you recommend me go instead? I searched about yellowstones but seems like most of the roads there will be closed too, but probably will have a more tolerable weather than fairbanks

Thank you!",2023-12-05 01:47:15
95,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, annoyed",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice? 

Thanks!  ",2024-02-28 18:41:22
96,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, annoyed",Raining More than Normal???,"Hi Y'all,

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.


TIA!",2023-08-24 02:12:08
97,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, annoyed",Things to do around Anchorage in early April?,"Hi Alaskans, I read a few tourist websites( [https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/](https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/)) that recommend visiting Anchorage in March/April. I have never been to Alaska and I have been on the mid atlantic since forever. What are your remmendations for things to do around this time of year?

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

98,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, annoyed",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

99,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, annoyed",Alaska in August,"Hello!
We plan to visit Alaska in mid August (12 - 19). We want to spend few days in Denali, a couple of days in Seward, and a couple of days in Fairbanks in hopes to watch some Aurora. We have some questions which will help us plan better:
1. How is the weather in Denali during August. Is it going to be usually cloudy and rainy? 
2. Is it worth spending couple of days in Fairbanks? The goal will be to watch Aurora if we are lucky. 
3. Seward - has anyone done the whale watching tour? Do people usually get to see some whales (especially in August)?

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

102,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, comfortable",Which UHaul Trailer should I choose for the Alaska Highway?,"Driving the Alaska highway down to the lower 48 from AK this August. Have a 2022 Ford Escape and more specifically the 4 cylinder AWD Hybrid model. Ford advertises that I should have around 1500 lb towing capacity and that a small teardrop trailer is fine to tow. I'm looking into getting the UHaul trailer hitch installed that has a 4500 lb capacity. There are two trailers from UHaul that I think I should be comfortable to tow. I'm waffling between the 4x8 and the 5x8 enclosed trailers they have to offer. The 4x8 already weighs around 850lbs and the 5x8 listed as 900lbs. So I was thinking to be safe and within 80% of my towing capacity it only gives me between 300 - 350 lbs depending on which model I were to choose. 

My biggest question for the group is whether or not the 4x8 or 5x8 would be reasonable on the Alaska Highway. It's not my first time driving it so I do remember the steep hills, which is a cause of my concern. If there was anyone with advice weather the 5x8 would be better off than the 4x8 or vice-a-versa it would be greatly appreciated. 

  
I have already looked into possibly pulling my car via their 10ft box trailer and it comes out closer to $3k which is less appealing.

103,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, comfortable",Visit Alaska during the Christmas season,"Hi alaskans! I am probably a madman but I am planning a very impromptu late december /January solo trip to alaska hoping to see the northern light and experience the winter landscape/nature.

I have researched a bit on this and my understanding is I would need to go to Fairbank and skip Anchorage if my focus is on nature and northern light. And need to consider

Pros:

- winter months have more night time and less light pollution, less cloudy than rekjavik, great chance seeing northern light, I read that sunset starts at 3:30pm.

- a lot of winter activities

- less tourists? 

Cons: 

- -40 F weather
- most touristy things are closed, denali road closure at Mile 3.
- animal sighting will be scarce

As someone who’s furtherst winter destination was New Hampshire, I just don’t have any idea as to how cold -40 is. Is it even possible to drink water outside? Is following a group absolutely necessary?

Also just how much stuff are open during Christmas? Can I see anything besides trees at all via cars(I searched some photos of fairbank in winter and it looks just like trees on snows)? And would I need to hike miles just to get to the edge of any meaningful landscape? 

If you would not recommend alaska in december/January, where would you recommend me go instead? I searched about yellowstones but seems like most of the roads there will be closed too, but probably will have a more tolerable weather than fairbanks

104,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, comfortable",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice?

105,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, comfortable",Raining More than Normal???,"Hi Y'all,

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.

106,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, comfortable",Things to do around Anchorage in early April?,"Hi Alaskans, I read a few tourist websites( [https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/](https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/)) that recommend visiting Anchorage in March/April. I have never been to Alaska and I have been on the mid atlantic since forever. What are your remmendations for things to do around this time of year?

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

107,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, comfortable",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

108,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, comfortable",Alaska in August,"Hello!
We plan to visit Alaska in mid August (12 - 19). We want to spend few days in Denali, a couple of days in Seward, and a couple of days in Fairbanks in hopes to watch some Aurora. We have some questions which will help us plan better:
1. How is the weather in Denali during August. Is it going to be usually cloudy and rainy? 
2. Is it worth spending couple of days in Fairbanks? The goal will be to watch Aurora if we are lucky. 
3. Seward - has anyone done the whale watching tour? Do people usually get to see some whales (especially in August)?

110,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

112,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, love",Just paid a visit to your state and I'm wearing shorts,"Anchorage was what I pictured ""typical"" Alaska to be in summertime -- cool weather, need jacket and hoodie.

Then I went to Fairbanks and wow it's like 86 out here and I have to wear shorts!  As a Texan this shocked me.

I didnt have enough time to visit the far north.

At any rate, I absolutely love your state.  Alaska truly is the last frontier and it's beauty was far greater than I anticipated.  My closest experience to you guys was Colorado but I have to say that Alaska blows Colorado out of the water.  Dont take your state for granted guys, there is stunning beauty everywhere you look that makes all the other states very jealous!

113,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, love",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50
114,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, love",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

115,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, love",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

116,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, love",I took a seasonal job in Seward this summer.,"I will be starting seasonal work in Seward this summer. I am beyond excited. I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).

117,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, love",Becoming a Bush Pilot ,"Hey y'all, my name is Spencer and for a long time I've had this need to go and live in Alaska, I'm a welder and have other limited experiences with car work, plumbing, outdoors skills, hunting, fishing, and kayaking. I have been doing as much research as I can online about what would be the best path for me to take to become a Bush Pilot in God's country. Should I do my flight school here in Central VA or move to Anchorage or Fairbanks, get a welding job and take flight school there since I'll be more adjusted to the weather Alaska will have to offer during my training? I want to be apart of this community, it can sound campy and probably just spew from someone who's young and dumb (I'm 25 as of posting this) but the allure of being someone that can take hunters, researchers, hikers, campers, and guides out to difficult spots and to assist in bringing supplies to communities, helping others out, being apart of something great is constantly drumming at my soul. I am at a stage of analysis paralysis and there's contradictory information out there on which is the best path. I don't want to take a lazy route, I want to earn this and be great to myself and others, I just want to know the best way to go about it. 

Thank you for y'alls time and I hope I got the wording of this out. If it helps any extra on where I'd like to make a more permanent living, the south east to south central parts of the state is what's attractive to me as a place for home but that can change once in the motion and falling in love with another spot.

120,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

122,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, love",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.

127,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, love",Excursion Recommendations - Planning for Parents,"Hi Everyone,

I am planning an Alaska Cruise for my parents. I've booked a Cruise and Land Tour via Princess on the Sapphire from July 20 - Aug 1, 2024. I would love to hear people's thoughts on the comments, excursions picked, and if they would swap it out for any other experiences. My parent's do not have any mobility issues, but are also in their 70s and not the most active. They could do a few miles hiking, but would nothing too adventurous and wouldn't want my Mom on uneven terrain for too long.  Also, my Mom is vegetarian.

1. Ketchikan - July 22 - 6:00 AM - 2:00 PM
   1. Saxman Native Village, Dance Performance & Totem Park via Princess
   2. Spend remaining time exploring the town and lunch (Annabelle's vs Alaska Fish House)
   3. NOTE: I would love for them to do an easy hike that would allow them to see some scenery and possibly wildlife. In an ideal world, they would do some Bear viewing tour, but those are all 400-1000 bucks, which is out of budget for this port.
   4. NOTE #2: I offered for them to do the Misty Fjords Seaplane, and because they're doing the helicopter tour and a boat tour later on, decided against it. I could persuade them if people felt strongly about it.
2. Juneau - July 23, - 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM
   1. Harv and Marv's Whale Watching Tour - 10:30 AM - 2:30 PM
   2. Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Park + Nugget Fall's
   3. Rest of time exploring Juneau with Dinner at Tracy's?
   4. NOTE: I offered doing Whale Watching + Helicopter here - but they didn't want to pack the day with too many things since it's a long trip.
3. Skagway - July 24 - 7:00 AM - 8:30 PM
   1. TEMSCO Glacier Helicopter Tour - one benefit of this is that if it gets canceled due to weather, they could be rescheduled for the Denali Helicopter Tour later on
   2. Some other activity? - Klondike Summit/Suspension Bridge?
4. Mt. McKinley Wilderness Lodge (nearest excursion site is Talkeetna?) - July 27 afternoon through July 29 morning
   1. Mahay's Riverboat Devil's Canyon Adventure
   2. NOTE: I offered doing Talkeetna Air Taxi's flightseeing tour - but I think they want a Helicopter.
   3. Not sure what else can really do here
5. Denali Princess Wilderness Lodge - July 29 afternoon - July 31 AM
   1. Included Denali Natural History Tour - Upgrade to Tundra Wilderness vs Kantishna
   2. Not sure if there's something to fit in July 29 afternoon

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

129,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, love",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

That said, I’m in anchorage for work, the dates are set, and I plan to extend the visit with my wife (both early thirties). 

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time.

At the moment, specific timing is mostly up in the air, but we’re 100% planning on Denali, Seward, and some day trips near Anchorage. While the flair is mostly tongue-in-cheek - I always try to do my own research before asking questions on Reddit - I still have a few questions either based on what I’ve read or that I couldn’t find online:

* I was seeing a lot of recommendations to book things in advance, but I want to be flexible in case of inclement weather (plus, still figuring out the itinerary). That said, for a lot of the things I was looking at (flightseeing, Kenai Fjords, trains, various kayaking trips, etc.), there’s plenty of availability, even if I wanted to go tomorrow or next week. Is it still advisable to book things weeks in advance, or would a few days suffice at this point? Is there a bigger tourist spike in August?

* I’ll be doing the Skinny Raven Half on 8/20 and want to try to keep my training up. While I feel decent about running opportunities in Anchorage (within downtown or in parks), I wanted to see if there would be similar opportunities near Denali or Seward - I’m used to road running, but I can do paved or even trails. I figured that Seward would be easy enough to just run around downtown, but I’m a bit iffy on Denali - one idea I had was running up and down Parks Highway for a few miles, but if this is a moronic idea, I’d definitely like to know (and also understand what to expect in terms of wildlife). 

* On another note, based on what I saw from a previous post, bear spray is advisable for runs - I wanted to confirm that this is the case even in Anchorage and Seward. Already planning on no headphones, but open to other recommendations and advice from runners, since I’m so used to running in cities and city parks. 

* Finally, I’ve done some baseline research, but I’m always up for any suggestions for restaurants and breweries, anywhere between Denali and Seward - especially love unique local food and smaller neighborhood brewpubs whose products I would never find out of state. If any of you have places you want to shout out, would love to hear about it!

137,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, hate",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

139,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, hate",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
140,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
141,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, hate",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

142,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, hate",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice? 

Thanks!  ",2024-02-28 18:41:22

144,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, hate",Raining More than Normal???,"Hi Y'all,

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.


TIA!",2023-08-24 02:12:08
145,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, hate",Do Kenai Fjord Tours sellout?,We are planning our first trip to Alaska this upcoming summer and are interested in taking one of the Kenai boat tours most likely either Major Marine or Kenai Fjord Tours. They both appear to be recommended and similar in options and price points. We have a 3 day window to take the tour the last week of July during the week (not weekend). I would prefer to book a day when we know we will have good weather. I would hate to book something now and then regret we chose a bad weather day. As long as there is plenty of availability we will book a few days ahead unless there is any recommendation the tours sell out in advance.

(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather?

149,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

150,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, enjoy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
151,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, enjoy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
152,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, enjoy",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.

157,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, enjoy",Just booked my tix for Alaska Sep 16-23rd,"I’ve been trying to plan Alaska with Friends/fam so long, since it’s never been possible I’m doing it solo. I’m curious if there are any day hiking tours or groups I could join. Don’t want to go meandering on long hikes alone. 

Will be in Anchorage, Denali, and Kenai. Please throw in any local recommendations on food/bars/attractions. 

I do photography so any related suggestions there would be great. Also, wondering about how easy it is to find fellow locals who’d be down to exploring or chilling, just curious as to the culture as well. Since, I am by myself it would be exciting to find likeminded people who enjoy outdoors and learn about Alaska with them.

UPDATE: something’s I have booked can still be canceled or changed for a fee, is it worth rescheduling my flight to 12th through 18th? (Will the weather, and overall opportunities be better?)",2023-09-02 11:57:30
158,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, enjoy",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

159,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, enjoy","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57
160,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, dislike",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
161,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, dislike",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

163,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

164,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, annoying",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
165,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, annoying",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

166,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, annoying",Raining More than Normal???,"Hi Y'all,

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.


TIA!",2023-08-24 02:12:08
167,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, happy",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50

169,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, happy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
170,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, happy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
171,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, happy",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

173,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, happy",Work in the Aleutian’s?,"Hello,

As the title states, I’m wondering if folks have any idea of work that would allow me to travel the Aleutian Islands?

Long story short, I grew up in Alaska and have since moved away. The last year or so I have been feeling the urge to swim back upstream (sorry, couldn’t resist) but would like to explore someplace new.  

I’m definitely not into working in a cannery and I don’t know how I’d fair on a fishing boat but other than those two, if I get to be outside I’m into it.

Not that it’s directly applicable but I’ve been a wildland firefighter these last eight years so hard work and weather won’t scare me off. In fact, I think I’d be most happy camping and hiking heavy loads through the wilderness.

Thanks for any suggestions!",2023-03-24 06:11:20
174,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, happy",Raining More than Normal???,"Hi Y'all,

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.


TIA!",2023-08-24 02:12:08
175,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, annoyed",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

176,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, annoyed",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
177,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, annoyed",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

178,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, annoyed",Raining More than Normal???,"Hi Y'all,

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.


TIA!",2023-08-24 02:12:08
179,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, comfortable",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

181,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, comfortable",Which UHaul Trailer should I choose for the Alaska Highway?,"Driving the Alaska highway down to the lower 48 from AK this August. Have a 2022 Ford Escape and more specifically the 4 cylinder AWD Hybrid model. Ford advertises that I should have around 1500 lb towing capacity and that a small teardrop trailer is fine to tow. I'm looking into getting the UHaul trailer hitch installed that has a 4500 lb capacity. There are two trailers from UHaul that I think I should be comfortable to tow. I'm waffling between the 4x8 and the 5x8 enclosed trailers they have to offer. The 4x8 already weighs around 850lbs and the 5x8 listed as 900lbs. So I was thinking to be safe and within 80% of my towing capacity it only gives me between 300 - 350 lbs depending on which model I were to choose. 

My biggest question for the group is whether or not the 4x8 or 5x8 would be reasonable on the Alaska Highway. It's not my first time driving it so I do remember the steep hills, which is a cause of my concern. If there was anyone with advice weather the 5x8 would be better off than the 4x8 or vice-a-versa it would be greatly appreciated. 

  
I have already looked into possibly pulling my car via their 10ft box trailer and it comes out closer to $3k which is less appealing.

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.

183,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

184,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, love",Just paid a visit to your state and I'm wearing shorts,"Anchorage was what I pictured ""typical"" Alaska to be in summertime -- cool weather, need jacket and hoodie.

Then I went to Fairbanks and wow it's like 86 out here and I have to wear shorts!  As a Texan this shocked me.

I didnt have enough time to visit the far north.

At any rate, I absolutely love your state.  Alaska truly is the last frontier and it's beauty was far greater than I anticipated.  My closest experience to you guys was Colorado but I have to say that Alaska blows Colorado out of the water.  Dont take your state for granted guys, there is stunning beauty everywhere you look that makes all the other states very jealous!

185,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, love",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50
186,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, love",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

187,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, love",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

188,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, love",I took a seasonal job in Seward this summer.,"I will be starting seasonal work in Seward this summer. I am beyond excited. I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).

189,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
190,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, love",Becoming a Bush Pilot ,"Hey y'all, my name is Spencer and for a long time I've had this need to go and live in Alaska, I'm a welder and have other limited experiences with car work, plumbing, outdoors skills, hunting, fishing, and kayaking. I have been doing as much research as I can online about what would be the best path for me to take to become a Bush Pilot in God's country. Should I do my flight school here in Central VA or move to Anchorage or Fairbanks, get a welding job and take flight school there since I'll be more adjusted to the weather Alaska will have to offer during my training? I want to be apart of this community, it can sound campy and probably just spew from someone who's young and dumb (I'm 25 as of posting this) but the allure of being someone that can take hunters, researchers, hikers, campers, and guides out to difficult spots and to assist in bringing supplies to communities, helping others out, being apart of something great is constantly drumming at my soul. I am at a stage of analysis paralysis and there's contradictory information out there on which is the best path. I don't want to take a lazy route, I want to earn this and be great to myself and others, I just want to know the best way to go about it. 

Thank you for y'alls time and I hope I got the wording of this out. If it helps any extra on where I'd like to make a more permanent living, the south east to south central parts of the state is what's attractive to me as a place for home but that can change once in the motion and falling in love with another spot. 

Again thank you all for your time!",2024-04-28 20:59:03

I just got a gig bartending up in Healy for the Summer season and I don't really know what to expect. I'm excited but I don't know anyone who has done anything like this. Living in California currently. I'll be arriving in Anchorage a few days early and doing some shopping at Costco, and some other stores if you guys have any recommendations.

**Anything I should buy here specifically before I leave?**

**What should I bring that I probably am not thinking about?**

**Is it ever shorts/ flipflop weather up there?**

**To anyone that's done this, or something similar, what's the crowd like? How's day to day?**

193,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

195,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, love",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

I am planning an Alaska Cruise for my parents. I've booked a Cruise and Land Tour via Princess on the Sapphire from July 20 - Aug 1, 2024. I would love to hear people's thoughts on the comments, excursions picked, and if they would swap it out for any other experiences. My parent's do not have any mobility issues, but are also in their 70s and not the most active. They could do a few miles hiking, but would nothing too adventurous and wouldn't want my Mom on uneven terrain for too long.  Also, my Mom is vegetarian.

1. Ketchikan - July 22 - 6:00 AM - 2:00 PM
   1. Saxman Native Village, Dance Performance & Totem Park via Princess
   2. Spend remaining time exploring the town and lunch (Annabelle's vs Alaska Fish House)
   3. NOTE: I would love for them to do an easy hike that would allow them to see some scenery and possibly wildlife. In an ideal world, they would do some Bear viewing tour, but those are all 400-1000 bucks, which is out of budget for this port.
   4. NOTE #2: I offered for them to do the Misty Fjords Seaplane, and because they're doing the helicopter tour and a boat tour later on, decided against it. I could persuade them if people felt strongly about it.
2. Juneau - July 23, - 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM
   1. Harv and Marv's Whale Watching Tour - 10:30 AM - 2:30 PM
   2. Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Park + Nugget Fall's
   3. Rest of time exploring Juneau with Dinner at Tracy's?
   4. NOTE: I offered doing Whale Watching + Helicopter here - but they didn't want to pack the day with too many things since it's a long trip.
3. Skagway - July 24 - 7:00 AM - 8:30 PM
   1. TEMSCO Glacier Helicopter Tour - one benefit of this is that if it gets canceled due to weather, they could be rescheduled for the Denali Helicopter Tour later on
   2. Some other activity? - Klondike Summit/Suspension Bridge?
4. Mt. McKinley Wilderness Lodge (nearest excursion site is Talkeetna?) - July 27 afternoon through July 29 morning
   1. Mahay's Riverboat Devil's Canyon Adventure
   2. NOTE: I offered doing Talkeetna Air Taxi's flightseeing tour - but I think they want a Helicopter.
   3. Not sure what else can really do here
5. Denali Princess Wilderness Lodge - July 29 afternoon - July 31 AM
   1. Included Denali Natural History Tour - Upgrade to Tundra Wilderness vs Kantishna
   2. Not sure if there's something to fit in July 29 afternoon

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

201,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, love",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time.

I have an all day Kenai Fjords boat tour booked on one of the very small boats. The marine forecast has turned and we may not be able to get to Aialik Bay. My question is- do you think the benefits of a small boat tour make it worth it to keep this booking and possibly stay in Resurrection Bay? Or should I go with a larger boat that is not quite so weather dependent? I'm in it more for the wildlife possibilities, especially since the fog might make scenery visibility nil. 
But as you all know, the small boat tours are $$$ compared to the big boys and this was one of the biggest splurges of our trip.

What better way to remember a loved one but with art!?

Cut down the tree two years ago, took a moisture reading and it said it was 17%, so being that these stumps last FOREVER in nature as is, I figure if I create a base that sheds water, and use a weather proof oil or some stain (any recommended materials for this particular piece would be appreciated!)",2023-07-23 16:23:19
208,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, love",Questions in advance of trip,"I’m currently planning a two-week trip to Alaska with my girlfriend (August 8-21). At the moment, specific timing is mostly up in the air, but we’re 100% planning on Denali, Seward, and some day trips near Anchorage. While the flair is mostly tongue-in-cheek - I always try to do my own research before asking questions on Reddit - I still have a few questions either based on what I’ve read or that I couldn’t find online:

* I was seeing a lot of recommendations to book things in advance, but I want to be flexible in case of inclement weather (plus, still figuring out the itinerary). That said, for a lot of the things I was looking at (flightseeing, Kenai Fjords, trains, various kayaking trips, etc.), there’s plenty of availability, even if I wanted to go tomorrow or next week. Is it still advisable to book things weeks in advance, or would a few days suffice at this point? Is there a bigger tourist spike in August?

* I’ll be doing the Skinny Raven Half on 8/20 and want to try to keep my training up. While I feel decent about running opportunities in Anchorage (within downtown or in parks), I wanted to see if there would be similar opportunities near Denali or Seward - I’m used to road running, but I can do paved or even trails. I figured that Seward would be easy enough to just run around downtown, but I’m a bit iffy on Denali - one idea I had was running up and down Parks Highway for a few miles, but if this is a moronic idea, I’d definitely like to know (and also understand what to expect in terms of wildlife). 

* On another note, based on what I saw from a previous post, bear spray is advisable for runs - I wanted to confirm that this is the case even in Anchorage and Seward. Already planning on no headphones, but open to other recommendations and advice from runners, since I’m so used to running in cities and city parks. 

* Finally, I’ve done some baseline research, but I’m always up for any suggestions for restaurants and breweries, anywhere between Denali and Seward - especially love unique local food and smaller neighborhood brewpubs whose products I would never find out of state. If any of you have places you want to shout out, would love to hear about it!

Thanks in advance - can’t wait to visit!",2023-07-22 16:23:23
209,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, hate",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

211,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
212,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, hate","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

213,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, hate",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice?

* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
219,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

220,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, enjoy",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
221,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, enjoy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24

I do photography so any related suggestions there would be great. Also, wondering about how easy it is to find fellow locals who’d be down to exploring or chilling, just curious as to the culture as well. Since, I am by myself it would be exciting to find likeminded people who enjoy outdoors and learn about Alaska with them.

226,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, enjoy",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

227,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, enjoy","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57
228,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, dislike","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
229,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
231,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, happy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak.

232,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, happy",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50
233,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, happy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24

235,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, happy",Work in the Aleutian’s?,"Hello,

As the title states, I’m wondering if folks have any idea of work that would allow me to travel the Aleutian Islands?

Long story short, I grew up in Alaska and have since moved away. The last year or so I have been feeling the urge to swim back upstream (sorry, couldn’t resist) but would like to explore someplace new.  

I’m definitely not into working in a cannery and I don’t know how I’d fair on a fishing boat but other than those two, if I get to be outside I’m into it.

Not that it’s directly applicable but I’ve been a wildland firefighter these last eight years so hard work and weather won’t scare me off. In fact, I think I’d be most happy camping and hiking heavy loads through the wilderness.

Thanks for any suggestions!",2023-03-24 06:11:20
236,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, annoyed",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

239,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, comfortable",Which UHaul Trailer should I choose for the Alaska Highway?,"Driving the Alaska highway down to the lower 48 from AK this August. Have a 2022 Ford Escape and more specifically the 4 cylinder AWD Hybrid model. Ford advertises that I should have around 1500 lb towing capacity and that a small teardrop trailer is fine to tow. I'm looking into getting the UHaul trailer hitch installed that has a 4500 lb capacity. There are two trailers from UHaul that I think I should be comfortable to tow. I'm waffling between the 4x8 and the 5x8 enclosed trailers they have to offer. The 4x8 already weighs around 850lbs and the 5x8 listed as 900lbs. So I was thinking to be safe and within 80% of my towing capacity it only gives me between 300 - 350 lbs depending on which model I were to choose. 

My biggest question for the group is whether or not the 4x8 or 5x8 would be reasonable on the Alaska Highway. It's not my first time driving it so I do remember the steep hills, which is a cause of my concern. If there was anyone with advice weather the 5x8 would be better off than the 4x8 or vice-a-versa it would be greatly appreciated. 

  
I have already looked into possibly pulling my car via their 10ft box trailer and it comes out closer to $3k which is less appealing.

I have never been to Alaska and I have been on the mid atlantic since forever. What are your remmendations for things to do around this time of year?

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

241,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, love",Just paid a visit to your state and I'm wearing shorts,"Anchorage was what I pictured ""typical"" Alaska to be in summertime -- cool weather, need jacket and hoodie.

Then I went to Fairbanks and wow it's like 86 out here and I have to wear shorts!  As a Texan this shocked me.

I didnt have enough time to visit the far north.

At any rate, I absolutely love your state.  Alaska truly is the last frontier and it's beauty was far greater than I anticipated.  My closest experience to you guys was Colorado but I have to say that Alaska blows Colorado out of the water.  Dont take your state for granted guys, there is stunning beauty everywhere you look that makes all the other states very jealous!

242,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, love",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50

I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

244,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, love",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

245,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, love",I took a seasonal job in Seward this summer.,"I will be starting seasonal work in Seward this summer. I am beyond excited. I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).


Thank you in advanced 💜",2024-03-08 04:51:16
246,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
247,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, love",Becoming a Bush Pilot ,"Hey y'all, my name is Spencer and for a long time I've had this need to go and live in Alaska, I'm a welder and have other limited experiences with car work, plumbing, outdoors skills, hunting, fishing, and kayaking. I have been doing as much research as I can online about what would be the best path for me to take to become a Bush Pilot in God's country. Should I do my flight school here in Central VA or move to Anchorage or Fairbanks, get a welding job and take flight school there since I'll be more adjusted to the weather Alaska will have to offer during my training? I want to be apart of this community, it can sound campy and probably just spew from someone who's young and dumb (I'm 25 as of posting this) but the allure of being someone that can take hunters, researchers, hikers, campers, and guides out to difficult spots and to assist in bringing supplies to communities, helping others out, being apart of something great is constantly drumming at my soul. I am at a stage of analysis paralysis and there's contradictory information out there on which is the best path. I don't want to take a lazy route, I want to earn this and be great to myself and others, I just want to know the best way to go about it. 

Thank you for y'alls time and I hope I got the wording of this out. If it helps any extra on where I'd like to make a more permanent living, the south east to south central parts of the state is what's attractive to me as a place for home but that can change once in the motion and falling in love with another spot. 

Again thank you all for your time!",2024-04-28 20:59:03

I just got a gig bartending up in Healy for the Summer season and I don't really know what to expect. I'm excited but I don't know anyone who has done anything like this. Living in California currently. I'll be arriving in Anchorage a few days early and doing some shopping at Costco, and some other stores if you guys have any recommendations.

**Anything I should buy here specifically before I leave?**

**What should I bring that I probably am not thinking about?**

**Is it ever shorts/ flipflop weather up there?**

**To anyone that's done this, or something similar, what's the crowd like? How's day to day?**

250,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

I am planning an Alaska Cruise for my parents. I've booked a Cruise and Land Tour via Princess on the Sapphire from July 20 - Aug 1, 2024. I would love to hear people's thoughts on the comments, excursions picked, and if they would swap it out for any other experiences. My parent's do not have any mobility issues, but are also in their 70s and not the most active. They could do a few miles hiking, but would nothing too adventurous and wouldn't want my Mom on uneven terrain for too long.  Also, my Mom is vegetarian.

1. Ketchikan - July 22 - 6:00 AM - 2:00 PM
   1. Saxman Native Village, Dance Performance & Totem Park via Princess
   2. Spend remaining time exploring the town and lunch (Annabelle's vs Alaska Fish House)
   3. NOTE: I would love for them to do an easy hike that would allow them to see some scenery and possibly wildlife. In an ideal world, they would do some Bear viewing tour, but those are all 400-1000 bucks, which is out of budget for this port.
   4. NOTE #2: I offered for them to do the Misty Fjords Seaplane, and because they're doing the helicopter tour and a boat tour later on, decided against it. I could persuade them if people felt strongly about it.
2. Juneau - July 23, - 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM
   1. Harv and Marv's Whale Watching Tour - 10:30 AM - 2:30 PM
   2. Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Park + Nugget Fall's
   3. Rest of time exploring Juneau with Dinner at Tracy's?
   4. NOTE: I offered doing Whale Watching + Helicopter here - but they didn't want to pack the day with too many things since it's a long trip.
3. Skagway - July 24 - 7:00 AM - 8:30 PM
   1. TEMSCO Glacier Helicopter Tour - one benefit of this is that if it gets canceled due to weather, they could be rescheduled for the Denali Helicopter Tour later on
   2. Some other activity? - Klondike Summit/Suspension Bridge?
4. Mt. McKinley Wilderness Lodge (nearest excursion site is Talkeetna?) - July 27 afternoon through July 29 morning
   1. Mahay's Riverboat Devil's Canyon Adventure
   2. NOTE: I offered doing Talkeetna Air Taxi's flightseeing tour - but I think they want a Helicopter.
   3. Not sure what else can really do here
5. Denali Princess Wilderness Lodge - July 29 afternoon - July 31 AM
   1. Included Denali Natural History Tour - Upgrade to Tundra Wilderness vs Kantishna
   2. Not sure if there's something to fit in July 29 afternoon

I appreciate any help or suggestions-  thank you!",2024-01-17 04:20:52
258,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, love",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time.

At the moment, specific timing is mostly up in the air, but we’re 100% planning on Denali, Seward, and some day trips near Anchorage. While the flair is mostly tongue-in-cheek - I always try to do my own research before asking questions on Reddit - I still have a few questions either based on what I’ve read or that I couldn’t find online:

* I was seeing a lot of recommendations to book things in advance, but I want to be flexible in case of inclement weather (plus, still figuring out the itinerary). That said, for a lot of the things I was looking at (flightseeing, Kenai Fjords, trains, various kayaking trips, etc.), there’s plenty of availability, even if I wanted to go tomorrow or next week. Is it still advisable to book things weeks in advance, or would a few days suffice at this point? Is there a bigger tourist spike in August?

* I’ll be doing the Skinny Raven Half on 8/20 and want to try to keep my training up. While I feel decent about running opportunities in Anchorage (within downtown or in parks), I wanted to see if there would be similar opportunities near Denali or Seward - I’m used to road running, but I can do paved or even trails. I figured that Seward would be easy enough to just run around downtown, but I’m a bit iffy on Denali - one idea I had was running up and down Parks Highway for a few miles, but if this is a moronic idea, I’d definitely like to know (and also understand what to expect in terms of wildlife). 

* On another note, based on what I saw from a previous post, bear spray is advisable for runs - I wanted to confirm that this is the case even in Anchorage and Seward. Already planning on no headphones, but open to other recommendations and advice from runners, since I’m so used to running in cities and city parks. 

* Finally, I’ve done some baseline research, but I’m always up for any suggestions for restaurants and breweries, anywhere between Denali and Seward - especially love unique local food and smaller neighborhood brewpubs whose products I would never find out of state. If any of you have places you want to shout out, would love to hear about it!

266,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, hate",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
269,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, hate",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice? 

Thanks!  ",2024-02-28 18:41:22

They both appear to be recommended and similar in options and price points. We have a 3 day window to take the tour the last week of July during the week (not weekend). I would prefer to book a day when we know we will have good weather. I would hate to book something now and then regret we chose a bad weather day. As long as there is plenty of availability we will book a few days ahead unless there is any recommendation the tours sell out in advance.

I have never been to Alaska and I have been on the mid atlantic since forever. What are your remmendations for things to do around this time of year?

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

275,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

276,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, enjoy",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

278,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, enjoy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

284,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, enjoy",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

285,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, enjoy","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

287,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

289,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, happy",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
291,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, happy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

As the title states, I’m wondering if folks have any idea of work that would allow me to travel the Aleutian Islands?

Long story short, I grew up in Alaska and have since moved away. The last year or so I have been feeling the urge to swim back upstream (sorry, couldn’t resist) but would like to explore someplace new.  

I’m definitely not into working in a cannery and I don’t know how I’d fair on a fishing boat but other than those two, if I get to be outside I’m into it.

Not that it’s directly applicable but I’ve been a wildland firefighter these last eight years so hard work and weather won’t scare me off. In fact, I think I’d be most happy camping and hiking heavy loads through the wilderness.

Thanks for any suggestions!",2023-03-24 06:11:20

295,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, annoyed",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

297,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, comfortable",Which UHaul Trailer should I choose for the Alaska Highway?,"Driving the Alaska highway down to the lower 48 from AK this August. Have a 2022 Ford Escape and more specifically the 4 cylinder AWD Hybrid model. Ford advertises that I should have around 1500 lb towing capacity and that a small teardrop trailer is fine to tow. I'm looking into getting the UHaul trailer hitch installed that has a 4500 lb capacity. There are two trailers from UHaul that I think I should be comfortable to tow. I'm waffling between the 4x8 and the 5x8 enclosed trailers they have to offer. The 4x8 already weighs around 850lbs and the 5x8 listed as 900lbs. So I was thinking to be safe and within 80% of my towing capacity it only gives me between 300 - 350 lbs depending on which model I were to choose. 

My biggest question for the group is whether or not the 4x8 or 5x8 would be reasonable on the Alaska Highway. It's not my first time driving it so I do remember the steep hills, which is a cause of my concern. If there was anyone with advice weather the 5x8 would be better off than the 4x8 or vice-a-versa it would be greatly appreciated. 

  
I have already looked into possibly pulling my car via their 10ft box trailer and it comes out closer to $3k which is less appealing.

Then I went to Fairbanks and wow it's like 86 out here and I have to wear shorts!  As a Texan this shocked me.

I didnt have enough time to visit the far north.

At any rate, I absolutely love your state.  Alaska truly is the last frontier and it's beauty was far greater than I anticipated.  My closest experience to you guys was Colorado but I have to say that Alaska blows Colorado out of the water.

300,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, love",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

301,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, love",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

303,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, love",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

304,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, love","Question for residents near Hurricane Gulch, Talkeetna, Denali area","Last summer, I went to Alaska with family for a couple weeks. I was on a train, heading north from Talkeetna to the Princess Lodges at Denali, and I spent a majority of the ride on the viewing platform. I managed to get some decent video of scenery, but not much because I prefer to do my sightseeing without a phone or camera. Anyways, at one point, either soon before or soon after one of the bridges, I was looking out in the distance and there was a valley-ish looking area and [judging by distance] there was a pretty large ""base"" of weird looking ""silos."" At first glance I thought grain silos, but the more I looked at it [it was only in sight for about 15, probably] the more industrial and more out of place it seemed. So I immediatelt went to google Earth to see what it was, and NOTHING but trees and mountain showed up. Of course my dumbass forgot to drop a pin and save the coords, but does anyone who lives in the area or been on that railroad track have any idea what it couldve been? Its been bugging me ever since and started me on a long, weird trek into Alaskan rabbit holes",2024-10-19 19:38:20
305,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, love",I took a seasonal job in Seward this summer.,"I will be starting seasonal work in Seward this summer. I am beyond excited. I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).

307,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
308,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, love",Becoming a Bush Pilot ,"Hey y'all, my name is Spencer and for a long time I've had this need to go and live in Alaska, I'm a welder and have other limited experiences with car work, plumbing, outdoors skills, hunting, fishing, and kayaking. I have been doing as much research as I can online about what would be the best path for me to take to become a Bush Pilot in God's country. Should I do my flight school here in Central VA or move to Anchorage or Fairbanks, get a welding job and take flight school there since I'll be more adjusted to the weather Alaska will have to offer during my training? I want to be apart of this community, it can sound campy and probably just spew from someone who's young and dumb (I'm 25 as of posting this) but the allure of being someone that can take hunters, researchers, hikers, campers, and guides out to difficult spots and to assist in bringing supplies to communities, helping others out, being apart of something great is constantly drumming at my soul. I am at a stage of analysis paralysis and there's contradictory information out there on which is the best path. I don't want to take a lazy route, I want to earn this and be great to myself and others, I just want to know the best way to go about it. 

Thank you for y'alls time and I hope I got the wording of this out. If it helps any extra on where I'd like to make a more permanent living, the south east to south central parts of the state is what's attractive to me as a place for home but that can change once in the motion and falling in love with another spot.

**What should I bring that I probably am not thinking about?**

311,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

312,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

314,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, love",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.

320,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, love",Excursion Recommendations - Planning for Parents,"Hi Everyone,

I am planning an Alaska Cruise for my parents. I've booked a Cruise and Land Tour via Princess on the Sapphire from July 20 - Aug 1, 2024. I would love to hear people's thoughts on the comments, excursions picked, and if they would swap it out for any other experiences. My parent's do not have any mobility issues, but are also in their 70s and not the most active. They could do a few miles hiking, but would nothing too adventurous and wouldn't want my Mom on uneven terrain for too long.  Also, my Mom is vegetarian.

1. Ketchikan - July 22 - 6:00 AM - 2:00 PM
   1. Saxman Native Village, Dance Performance & Totem Park via Princess
   2. Spend remaining time exploring the town and lunch (Annabelle's vs Alaska Fish House)
   3. NOTE: I would love for them to do an easy hike that would allow them to see some scenery and possibly wildlife. In an ideal world, they would do some Bear viewing tour, but those are all 400-1000 bucks, which is out of budget for this port.
   4. NOTE #2: I offered for them to do the Misty Fjords Seaplane, and because they're doing the helicopter tour and a boat tour later on, decided against it. I could persuade them if people felt strongly about it.
2. Juneau - July 23, - 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM
   1. Harv and Marv's Whale Watching Tour - 10:30 AM - 2:30 PM
   2. Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Park + Nugget Fall's
   3. Rest of time exploring Juneau with Dinner at Tracy's?
   4. NOTE: I offered doing Whale Watching + Helicopter here - but they didn't want to pack the day with too many things since it's a long trip.
3. Skagway - July 24 - 7:00 AM - 8:30 PM
   1. TEMSCO Glacier Helicopter Tour - one benefit of this is that if it gets canceled due to weather, they could be rescheduled for the Denali Helicopter Tour later on
   2. Some other activity? - Klondike Summit/Suspension Bridge?
4. Mt. McKinley Wilderness Lodge (nearest excursion site is Talkeetna?) - July 27 afternoon through July 29 morning
   1. Mahay's Riverboat Devil's Canyon Adventure
   2. NOTE: I offered doing Talkeetna Air Taxi's flightseeing tour - but I think they want a Helicopter.
   3. Not sure what else can really do here
5. Denali Princess Wilderness Lodge - July 29 afternoon - July 31 AM
   1. Included Denali Natural History Tour - Upgrade to Tundra Wilderness vs Kantishna
   2. Not sure if there's something to fit in July 29 afternoon

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

322,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, love",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

Cut down the tree two years ago, took a moisture reading and it said it was 17%, so being that these stumps last FOREVER in nature as is, I figure if I create a base that sheds water, and use a weather proof oil or some stain (any recommended materials for this particular piece would be appreciated!)",2023-07-23 16:23:19
330,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, love",Questions in advance of trip,"I’m currently planning a two-week trip to Alaska with my girlfriend (August 8-21). At the moment, specific timing is mostly up in the air, but we’re 100% planning on Denali, Seward, and some day trips near Anchorage. While the flair is mostly tongue-in-cheek - I always try to do my own research before asking questions on Reddit - I still have a few questions either based on what I’ve read or that I couldn’t find online:

* I was seeing a lot of recommendations to book things in advance, but I want to be flexible in case of inclement weather (plus, still figuring out the itinerary). That said, for a lot of the things I was looking at (flightseeing, Kenai Fjords, trains, various kayaking trips, etc.), there’s plenty of availability, even if I wanted to go tomorrow or next week. Is it still advisable to book things weeks in advance, or would a few days suffice at this point? Is there a bigger tourist spike in August?

* I’ll be doing the Skinny Raven Half on 8/20 and want to try to keep my training up. While I feel decent about running opportunities in Anchorage (within downtown or in parks), I wanted to see if there would be similar opportunities near Denali or Seward - I’m used to road running, but I can do paved or even trails. I figured that Seward would be easy enough to just run around downtown, but I’m a bit iffy on Denali - one idea I had was running up and down Parks Highway for a few miles, but if this is a moronic idea, I’d definitely like to know (and also understand what to expect in terms of wildlife). 

* On another note, based on what I saw from a previous post, bear spray is advisable for runs - I wanted to confirm that this is the case even in Anchorage and Seward. Already planning on no headphones, but open to other recommendations and advice from runners, since I’m so used to running in cities and city parks. 

* Finally, I’ve done some baseline research, but I’m always up for any suggestions for restaurants and breweries, anywhere between Denali and Seward - especially love unique local food and smaller neighborhood brewpubs whose products I would never find out of state. If any of you have places you want to shout out, would love to hear about it!

Thanks in advance - can’t wait to visit!",2023-07-22 16:23:23

I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

336,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
337,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, hate",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice?

339,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, hate",Raining More than Normal???,"Hi Y'all,

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.

343,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
348,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, enjoy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

352,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, enjoy",Raining More than Normal???,"Hi Y'all,

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.

I’m curious if there are any day hiking tours or groups I could join. Don’t want to go meandering on long hikes alone. 

Will be in Anchorage, Denali, and Kenai. Please throw in any local recommendations on food/bars/attractions. 

I do photography so any related suggestions there would be great. Also, wondering about how easy it is to find fellow locals who’d be down to exploring or chilling, just curious as to the culture as well. Since, I am by myself it would be exciting to find likeminded people who enjoy outdoors and learn about Alaska with them.

354,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, enjoy",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

355,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, enjoy","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

359,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.

363,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, happy",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50

366,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, happy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
367,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, happy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

As the title states, I’m wondering if folks have any idea of work that would allow me to travel the Aleutian Islands?

Long story short, I grew up in Alaska and have since moved away. The last year or so I have been feeling the urge to swim back upstream (sorry, couldn’t resist) but would like to explore someplace new.  

I’m definitely not into working in a cannery and I don’t know how I’d fair on a fishing boat but other than those two, if I get to be outside I’m into it.

Not that it’s directly applicable but I’ve been a wildland firefighter these last eight years so hard work and weather won’t scare me off. In fact, I think I’d be most happy camping and hiking heavy loads through the wilderness.

372,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, annoyed",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists.

Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.

Have a 2022 Ford Escape and more specifically the 4 cylinder AWD Hybrid model. Ford advertises that I should have around 1500 lb towing capacity and that a small teardrop trailer is fine to tow. I'm looking into getting the UHaul trailer hitch installed that has a 4500 lb capacity. There are two trailers from UHaul that I think I should be comfortable to tow. I'm waffling between the 4x8 and the 5x8 enclosed trailers they have to offer. The 4x8 already weighs around 850lbs and the 5x8 listed as 900lbs. So I was thinking to be safe and within 80% of my towing capacity it only gives me between 300 - 350 lbs depending on which model I were to choose. 

My biggest question for the group is whether or not the 4x8 or 5x8 would be reasonable on the Alaska Highway. It's not my first time driving it so I do remember the steep hills, which is a cause of my concern. If there was anyone with advice weather the 5x8 would be better off than the 4x8 or vice-a-versa it would be greatly appreciated. 

  
I have already looked into possibly pulling my car via their 10ft box trailer and it comes out closer to $3k which is less appealing.

At any rate, I absolutely love your state.  Alaska truly is the last frontier and it's beauty was far greater than I anticipated.

381,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, love",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

382,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, love",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles.

383,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, love",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

384,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, love",I took a seasonal job in Seward this summer.,"I will be starting seasonal work in Seward this summer. I am beyond excited. I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).

385,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

I have been doing as much research as I can online about what would be the best path for me to take to become a Bush Pilot in God's country. Should I do my flight school here in Central VA or move to Anchorage or Fairbanks, get a welding job and take flight school there since I'll be more adjusted to the weather Alaska will have to offer during my training? I want to be apart of this community, it can sound campy and probably just spew from someone who's young and dumb (I'm 25 as of posting this) but the allure of being someone that can take hunters, researchers, hikers, campers, and guides out to difficult spots and to assist in bringing supplies to communities, helping others out, being apart of something great is constantly drumming at my soul. I am at a stage of analysis paralysis and there's contradictory information out there on which is the best path. I don't want to take a lazy route, I want to earn this and be great to myself and others, I just want to know the best way to go about it. 

Thank you for y'alls time and I hope I got the wording of this out. If it helps any extra on where I'd like to make a more permanent living, the south east to south central parts of the state is what's attractive to me as a place for home but that can change once in the motion and falling in love with another spot.

389,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
390,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

392,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, love",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

I am planning an Alaska Cruise for my parents. I've booked a Cruise and Land Tour via Princess on the Sapphire from July 20 - Aug 1, 2024. I would love to hear people's thoughts on the comments, excursions picked, and if they would swap it out for any other experiences. My parent's do not have any mobility issues, but are also in their 70s and not the most active. They could do a few miles hiking, but would nothing too adventurous and wouldn't want my Mom on uneven terrain for too long.  Also, my Mom is vegetarian.

1. Ketchikan - July 22 - 6:00 AM - 2:00 PM
   1. Saxman Native Village, Dance Performance & Totem Park via Princess
   2. Spend remaining time exploring the town and lunch (Annabelle's vs Alaska Fish House)
   3. NOTE: I would love for them to do an easy hike that would allow them to see some scenery and possibly wildlife. In an ideal world, they would do some Bear viewing tour, but those are all 400-1000 bucks, which is out of budget for this port.
   4. NOTE #2: I offered for them to do the Misty Fjords Seaplane, and because they're doing the helicopter tour and a boat tour later on, decided against it. I could persuade them if people felt strongly about it.
2. Juneau - July 23, - 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM
   1. Harv and Marv's Whale Watching Tour - 10:30 AM - 2:30 PM
   2. Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Park + Nugget Fall's
   3. Rest of time exploring Juneau with Dinner at Tracy's?
   4. NOTE: I offered doing Whale Watching + Helicopter here - but they didn't want to pack the day with too many things since it's a long trip.
3. Skagway - July 24 - 7:00 AM - 8:30 PM
   1. TEMSCO Glacier Helicopter Tour - one benefit of this is that if it gets canceled due to weather, they could be rescheduled for the Denali Helicopter Tour later on
   2. Some other activity? - Klondike Summit/Suspension Bridge?
4. Mt. McKinley Wilderness Lodge (nearest excursion site is Talkeetna?) - July 27 afternoon through July 29 morning
   1. Mahay's Riverboat Devil's Canyon Adventure
   2. NOTE: I offered doing Talkeetna Air Taxi's flightseeing tour - but I think they want a Helicopter.
   3. Not sure what else can really do here
5. Denali Princess Wilderness Lodge - July 29 afternoon - July 31 AM
   1. Included Denali Natural History Tour - Upgrade to Tundra Wilderness vs Kantishna
   2. Not sure if there's something to fit in July 29 afternoon

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

398,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, love",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

Since we met there, we thought it would be sweet.
 
I've always been an avid xcountry skier, and she's good at both, but neither of us have ever done an overnight winter backcountry trip. We do have lots of experience in cold weather though ( lived in fbx) and we love to backpack. 

Through reccomendationa from friends, we decided to celebrate by doing a part of ressurection pass: the north entrance to Caribou Creek Cabin ( 7 -8 miles). 

I haven't seen much info on doing this part in the winter. 

Anyone have any experience with this trail? Are we being stupid going this time of year?

Also I'd love any tips in general for back country ski trips.",2023-11-07 21:36:59
400,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, love",Sightseeing late September (extending work trip),"First of all, I completely understand that the last week of September means potentially rainy weather, closures, and a limit on some of the typical Alaskan experiences tourists like myself might experience in the summer months. That said, I’m in anchorage for work, the dates are set, and I plan to extend the visit with my wife (both early thirties). 

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time. 

Appreciate any guidance this group can provide. Have visited Alaska before, love it, and can’t wait to be back with my wife.",2023-08-13 20:54:47

I have an all day Kenai Fjords boat tour booked on one of the very small boats. The marine forecast has turned and we may not be able to get to Aialik Bay. My question is- do you think the benefits of a small boat tour make it worth it to keep this booking and possibly stay in Resurrection Bay? Or should I go with a larger boat that is not quite so weather dependent? I'm in it more for the wildlife possibilities, especially since the fog might make scenery visibility nil. 
But as you all know, the small boat tours are $$$ compared to the big boys and this was one of the biggest splurges of our trip.

405,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, love",Questions in advance of trip,"I’m currently planning a two-week trip to Alaska with my girlfriend (August 8-21). At the moment, specific timing is mostly up in the air, but we’re 100% planning on Denali, Seward, and some day trips near Anchorage. While the flair is mostly tongue-in-cheek - I always try to do my own research before asking questions on Reddit - I still have a few questions either based on what I’ve read or that I couldn’t find online:

* I was seeing a lot of recommendations to book things in advance, but I want to be flexible in case of inclement weather (plus, still figuring out the itinerary). That said, for a lot of the things I was looking at (flightseeing, Kenai Fjords, trains, various kayaking trips, etc.), there’s plenty of availability, even if I wanted to go tomorrow or next week. Is it still advisable to book things weeks in advance, or would a few days suffice at this point? Is there a bigger tourist spike in August?

* I’ll be doing the Skinny Raven Half on 8/20 and want to try to keep my training up. While I feel decent about running opportunities in Anchorage (within downtown or in parks), I wanted to see if there would be similar opportunities near Denali or Seward - I’m used to road running, but I can do paved or even trails. I figured that Seward would be easy enough to just run around downtown, but I’m a bit iffy on Denali - one idea I had was running up and down Parks Highway for a few miles, but if this is a moronic idea, I’d definitely like to know (and also understand what to expect in terms of wildlife). 

* On another note, based on what I saw from a previous post, bear spray is advisable for runs - I wanted to confirm that this is the case even in Anchorage and Seward. Already planning on no headphones, but open to other recommendations and advice from runners, since I’m so used to running in cities and city parks. 

* Finally, I’ve done some baseline research, but I’m always up for any suggestions for restaurants and breweries, anywhere between Denali and Seward - especially love unique local food and smaller neighborhood brewpubs whose products I would never find out of state. If any of you have places you want to shout out, would love to hear about it!

Thanks in advance - can’t wait to visit!",2023-07-22 16:23:23
406,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, hate",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

408,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
409,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, hate",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice?

414,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

415,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, enjoy",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
416,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, enjoy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
417,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, enjoy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

I do photography so any related suggestions there would be great.

422,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, enjoy",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

423,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, enjoy","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57
424,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

425,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, happy",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50
426,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, happy",Looking to move to Anchorage from Las Vegas...,"OK, so long story short, I'm just not happy with my current life situation and a big play in that mentally is living in this sand trap desert. I could write a book on why, but I'll save all that typing.

I don't have much experience moving such a distance, especially by myself. I moved to Texas after HS and back to Vegas after graduation so that's really it. But to go as far as the \*real\* North.. I don't even know where to begin. How do I figure out housing, job, and other types of expenses (plus the whole moving process in general) with a state I have 0 - 2% knowledge of and is what feels like 2x planets away? Like, do I need a passport to drive there since I would have to go through Canada? Could I take a boat there instead? Or would I even want to take a boat there to begin with..? Sounds stupid but I'm just giving half-ass examples of what I think going about such a decision is going to take.

But again, I have no idea. Alaska in general will be a whole new world (again) for me. Reason why I'd like to settle there, reset my life and forget the past, even if it's just a little. My gut tells me Alaska is that place I'm trying to find. But hey, maybe it will be; maybe it won't be...

What I do believe is that it'll be a place I could start another new chapter in my life. Like, do I want to settle with my current stagnating position, living life so dull and alone one could argue it's a pointless existence..? Maybe the opportunities I've been looking for all these years are here... So, any type of advice is greatly appreciated!

Update: 7:21 PST 05/18: Wow... The amount of passive-aggressive responses in such a short time to a non-hostile, non-offending, general question of a post really says something. 2014 Reddit and 2024 Reddit really have became two different places. If anything, I'm more so dumbfounded on the idea that I've lived long enough to see such a thing go about.

But whatever... If clicking on an arrow aiming down gives you the rock dick of a lifetime who am I to give a s\* about. lol

Update: 9:00 - 08 PM PST Same Day: Well, I hope these thread proved entertaining for some of you, lol. But I am tired now and going to sleep. To those that actually have a sense of compassion I appreciate the advice regardless of cautionary level. For those who have messaged me, I'll give a response tomorrow by noon. As for the rest of you... I'd be embarrassed, but good luck! ",2024-05-19 01:08:14
427,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, happy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
428,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, happy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

As the title states, I’m wondering if folks have any idea of work that would allow me to travel the Aleutian Islands?

Long story short, I grew up in Alaska and have since moved away. The last year or so I have been feeling the urge to swim back upstream (sorry, couldn’t resist) but would like to explore someplace new.  

I’m definitely not into working in a cannery and I don’t know how I’d fair on a fishing boat but other than those two, if I get to be outside I’m into it.

Not that it’s directly applicable but I’ve been a wildland firefighter these last eight years so hard work and weather won’t scare me off. In fact, I think I’d be most happy camping and hiking heavy loads through the wilderness.

Thanks for any suggestions!",2023-03-24 06:11:20
431,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, annoyed",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

432,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, comfortable",Which UHaul Trailer should I choose for the Alaska Highway?,"Driving the Alaska highway down to the lower 48 from AK this August. Have a 2022 Ford Escape and more specifically the 4 cylinder AWD Hybrid model. Ford advertises that I should have around 1500 lb towing capacity and that a small teardrop trailer is fine to tow. I'm looking into getting the UHaul trailer hitch installed that has a 4500 lb capacity. There are two trailers from UHaul that I think I should be comfortable to tow. I'm waffling between the 4x8 and the 5x8 enclosed trailers they have to offer. The 4x8 already weighs around 850lbs and the 5x8 listed as 900lbs. So I was thinking to be safe and within 80% of my towing capacity it only gives me between 300 - 350 lbs depending on which model I were to choose. 

My biggest question for the group is whether or not the 4x8 or 5x8 would be reasonable on the Alaska Highway. It's not my first time driving it so I do remember the steep hills, which is a cause of my concern. If there was anyone with advice weather the 5x8 would be better off than the 4x8 or vice-a-versa it would be greatly appreciated. 

  
I have already looked into possibly pulling my car via their 10ft box trailer and it comes out closer to $3k which is less appealing.

Then I went to Fairbanks and wow it's like 86 out here and I have to wear shorts!  As a Texan this shocked me.

I didnt have enough time to visit the far north.

At any rate, I absolutely love your state.  Alaska truly is the last frontier and it's beauty was far greater than I anticipated.  My closest experience to you guys was Colorado but I have to say that Alaska blows Colorado out of the water.  Dont take your state for granted guys, there is stunning beauty everywhere you look that makes all the other states very jealous!

434,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, love",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50
435,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, love",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed.

436,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, love",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

437,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, love",I took a seasonal job in Seward this summer.,"I will be starting seasonal work in Seward this summer. I am beyond excited. I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).


Thank you in advanced 💜",2024-03-08 04:51:16
438,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

I have been doing as much research as I can online about what would be the best path for me to take to become a Bush Pilot in God's country. Should I do my flight school here in Central VA or move to Anchorage or Fairbanks, get a welding job and take flight school there since I'll be more adjusted to the weather Alaska will have to offer during my training? I want to be apart of this community, it can sound campy and probably just spew from someone who's young and dumb (I'm 25 as of posting this) but the allure of being someone that can take hunters, researchers, hikers, campers, and guides out to difficult spots and to assist in bringing supplies to communities, helping others out, being apart of something great is constantly drumming at my soul. I am at a stage of analysis paralysis and there's contradictory information out there on which is the best path. I don't want to take a lazy route, I want to earn this and be great to myself and others, I just want to know the best way to go about it. 

Thank you for y'alls time and I hope I got the wording of this out. If it helps any extra on where I'd like to make a more permanent living, the south east to south central parts of the state is what's attractive to me as a place for home but that can change once in the motion and falling in love with another spot.

442,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
443,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

445,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, love",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.

450,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, love",Excursion Recommendations - Planning for Parents,"Hi Everyone,

I am planning an Alaska Cruise for my parents. I've booked a Cruise and Land Tour via Princess on the Sapphire from July 20 - Aug 1, 2024. I would love to hear people's thoughts on the comments, excursions picked, and if they would swap it out for any other experiences. My parent's do not have any mobility issues, but are also in their 70s and not the most active. They could do a few miles hiking, but would nothing too adventurous and wouldn't want my Mom on uneven terrain for too long.  Also, my Mom is vegetarian.

1. Ketchikan - July 22 - 6:00 AM - 2:00 PM
   1. Saxman Native Village, Dance Performance & Totem Park via Princess
   2. Spend remaining time exploring the town and lunch (Annabelle's vs Alaska Fish House)
   3. NOTE: I would love for them to do an easy hike that would allow them to see some scenery and possibly wildlife. In an ideal world, they would do some Bear viewing tour, but those are all 400-1000 bucks, which is out of budget for this port.
   4. NOTE #2: I offered for them to do the Misty Fjords Seaplane, and because they're doing the helicopter tour and a boat tour later on, decided against it. I could persuade them if people felt strongly about it.
2. Juneau - July 23, - 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM
   1. Harv and Marv's Whale Watching Tour - 10:30 AM - 2:30 PM
   2. Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Park + Nugget Fall's
   3. Rest of time exploring Juneau with Dinner at Tracy's?
   4. NOTE: I offered doing Whale Watching + Helicopter here - but they didn't want to pack the day with too many things since it's a long trip.
3. Skagway - July 24 - 7:00 AM - 8:30 PM
   1. TEMSCO Glacier Helicopter Tour - one benefit of this is that if it gets canceled due to weather, they could be rescheduled for the Denali Helicopter Tour later on
   2. Some other activity? - Klondike Summit/Suspension Bridge?
4. Mt. McKinley Wilderness Lodge (nearest excursion site is Talkeetna?) - July 27 afternoon through July 29 morning
   1. Mahay's Riverboat Devil's Canyon Adventure
   2. NOTE: I offered doing Talkeetna Air Taxi's flightseeing tour - but I think they want a Helicopter.
   3. Not sure what else can really do here
5. Denali Princess Wilderness Lodge - July 29 afternoon - July 31 AM
   1. Included Denali Natural History Tour - Upgrade to Tundra Wilderness vs Kantishna
   2. Not sure if there's something to fit in July 29 afternoon

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

452,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, love",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time. 

Appreciate any guidance this group can provide. Have visited Alaska before, love it, and can’t wait to be back with my wife.",2023-08-13 20:54:47

I have an all day Kenai Fjords boat tour booked on one of the very small boats. The marine forecast has turned and we may not be able to get to Aialik Bay. My question is- do you think the benefits of a small boat tour make it worth it to keep this booking and possibly stay in Resurrection Bay? Or should I go with a larger boat that is not quite so weather dependent? I'm in it more for the wildlife possibilities, especially since the fog might make scenery visibility nil. 
But as you all know, the small boat tours are $$$ compared to the big boys and this was one of the biggest splurges of our trip.

459,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, love",Questions in advance of trip,"I’m currently planning a two-week trip to Alaska with my girlfriend (August 8-21). At the moment, specific timing is mostly up in the air, but we’re 100% planning on Denali, Seward, and some day trips near Anchorage. While the flair is mostly tongue-in-cheek - I always try to do my own research before asking questions on Reddit - I still have a few questions either based on what I’ve read or that I couldn’t find online:

* I was seeing a lot of recommendations to book things in advance, but I want to be flexible in case of inclement weather (plus, still figuring out the itinerary). That said, for a lot of the things I was looking at (flightseeing, Kenai Fjords, trains, various kayaking trips, etc.), there’s plenty of availability, even if I wanted to go tomorrow or next week. Is it still advisable to book things weeks in advance, or would a few days suffice at this point? Is there a bigger tourist spike in August?

* I’ll be doing the Skinny Raven Half on 8/20 and want to try to keep my training up. While I feel decent about running opportunities in Anchorage (within downtown or in parks), I wanted to see if there would be similar opportunities near Denali or Seward - I’m used to road running, but I can do paved or even trails. I figured that Seward would be easy enough to just run around downtown, but I’m a bit iffy on Denali - one idea I had was running up and down Parks Highway for a few miles, but if this is a moronic idea, I’d definitely like to know (and also understand what to expect in terms of wildlife). 

* On another note, based on what I saw from a previous post, bear spray is advisable for runs - I wanted to confirm that this is the case even in Anchorage and Seward. Already planning on no headphones, but open to other recommendations and advice from runners, since I’m so used to running in cities and city parks. 

* Finally, I’ve done some baseline research, but I’m always up for any suggestions for restaurants and breweries, anywhere between Denali and Seward - especially love unique local food and smaller neighborhood brewpubs whose products I would never find out of state. If any of you have places you want to shout out, would love to hear about it!

Thanks in advance - can’t wait to visit!",2023-07-22 16:23:23
460,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, hate",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

462,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
463,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, hate",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice?

465,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, hate",Raining More than Normal???,"Hi Y'all,

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.

469,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

470,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, enjoy",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
472,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, enjoy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

476,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, enjoy",Raining More than Normal???,"Hi Y'all,

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.

I’m curious if there are any day hiking tours or groups I could join. Don’t want to go meandering on long hikes alone. 

Will be in Anchorage, Denali, and Kenai. Please throw in any local recommendations on food/bars/attractions. 

I do photography so any related suggestions there would be great. Also, wondering about how easy it is to find fellow locals who’d be down to exploring or chilling, just curious as to the culture as well. Since, I am by myself it would be exciting to find likeminded people who enjoy outdoors and learn about Alaska with them.

478,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, enjoy",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

479,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, enjoy","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?

481,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

482,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, annoying",Raining More than Normal???,"Hi Y'all,

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system.

483,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, happy",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50
484,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, happy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
485,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, happy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

As the title states, I’m wondering if folks have any idea of work that would allow me to travel the Aleutian Islands?

Long story short, I grew up in Alaska and have since moved away. The last year or so I have been feeling the urge to swim back upstream (sorry, couldn’t resist) but would like to explore someplace new.  

I’m definitely not into working in a cannery and I don’t know how I’d fair on a fishing boat but other than those two, if I get to be outside I’m into it.

Not that it’s directly applicable but I’ve been a wildland firefighter these last eight years so hard work and weather won’t scare me off. In fact, I think I’d be most happy camping and hiking heavy loads through the wilderness.

Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

490,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, annoyed",Raining More than Normal???,"Hi Y'all,

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.

491,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, comfortable",Which UHaul Trailer should I choose for the Alaska Highway?,"Driving the Alaska highway down to the lower 48 from AK this August. Have a 2022 Ford Escape and more specifically the 4 cylinder AWD Hybrid model. Ford advertises that I should have around 1500 lb towing capacity and that a small teardrop trailer is fine to tow. I'm looking into getting the UHaul trailer hitch installed that has a 4500 lb capacity. There are two trailers from UHaul that I think I should be comfortable to tow. I'm waffling between the 4x8 and the 5x8 enclosed trailers they have to offer. The 4x8 already weighs around 850lbs and the 5x8 listed as 900lbs. So I was thinking to be safe and within 80% of my towing capacity it only gives me between 300 - 350 lbs depending on which model I were to choose. 

My biggest question for the group is whether or not the 4x8 or 5x8 would be reasonable on the Alaska Highway. It's not my first time driving it so I do remember the steep hills, which is a cause of my concern. If there was anyone with advice weather the 5x8 would be better off than the 4x8 or vice-a-versa it would be greatly appreciated. 

  
I have already looked into possibly pulling my car via their 10ft box trailer and it comes out closer to $3k which is less appealing.

Then I went to Fairbanks and wow it's like 86 out here and I have to wear shorts!  As a Texan this shocked me.

I didnt have enough time to visit the far north.

At any rate, I absolutely love your state.  Alaska truly is the last frontier and it's beauty was far greater than I anticipated.  My closest experience to you guys was Colorado but I have to say that Alaska blows Colorado out of the water.  Dont take your state for granted guys, there is stunning beauty everywhere you look that makes all the other states very jealous!

494,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, love",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

495,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, love",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there?

496,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, love",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

497,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, love",I took a seasonal job in Seward this summer.,"I will be starting seasonal work in Seward this summer. I am beyond excited. I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).

498,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

I have been doing as much research as I can online about what would be the best path for me to take to become a Bush Pilot in God's country. Should I do my flight school here in Central VA or move to Anchorage or Fairbanks, get a welding job and take flight school there since I'll be more adjusted to the weather Alaska will have to offer during my training? I want to be apart of this community, it can sound campy and probably just spew from someone who's young and dumb (I'm 25 as of posting this) but the allure of being someone that can take hunters, researchers, hikers, campers, and guides out to difficult spots and to assist in bringing supplies to communities, helping others out, being apart of something great is constantly drumming at my soul. I am at a stage of analysis paralysis and there's contradictory information out there on which is the best path. I don't want to take a lazy route, I want to earn this and be great to myself and others, I just want to know the best way to go about it. 

Thank you for y'alls time and I hope I got the wording of this out. If it helps any extra on where I'd like to make a more permanent living, the south east to south central parts of the state is what's attractive to me as a place for home but that can change once in the motion and falling in love with another spot.

502,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
503,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

505,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, love",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

I am planning an Alaska Cruise for my parents. I've booked a Cruise and Land Tour via Princess on the Sapphire from July 20 - Aug 1, 2024. I would love to hear people's thoughts on the comments, excursions picked, and if they would swap it out for any other experiences. My parent's do not have any mobility issues, but are also in their 70s and not the most active. They could do a few miles hiking, but would nothing too adventurous and wouldn't want my Mom on uneven terrain for too long.  Also, my Mom is vegetarian.

1. Ketchikan - July 22 - 6:00 AM - 2:00 PM
   1. Saxman Native Village, Dance Performance & Totem Park via Princess
   2. Spend remaining time exploring the town and lunch (Annabelle's vs Alaska Fish House)
   3. NOTE: I would love for them to do an easy hike that would allow them to see some scenery and possibly wildlife. In an ideal world, they would do some Bear viewing tour, but those are all 400-1000 bucks, which is out of budget for this port.
   4. NOTE #2: I offered for them to do the Misty Fjords Seaplane, and because they're doing the helicopter tour and a boat tour later on, decided against it. I could persuade them if people felt strongly about it.
2. Juneau - July 23, - 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM
   1. Harv and Marv's Whale Watching Tour - 10:30 AM - 2:30 PM
   2. Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Park + Nugget Fall's
   3. Rest of time exploring Juneau with Dinner at Tracy's?
   4. NOTE: I offered doing Whale Watching + Helicopter here - but they didn't want to pack the day with too many things since it's a long trip.
3. Skagway - July 24 - 7:00 AM - 8:30 PM
   1. TEMSCO Glacier Helicopter Tour - one benefit of this is that if it gets canceled due to weather, they could be rescheduled for the Denali Helicopter Tour later on
   2. Some other activity? - Klondike Summit/Suspension Bridge?
4. Mt. McKinley Wilderness Lodge (nearest excursion site is Talkeetna?) - July 27 afternoon through July 29 morning
   1. Mahay's Riverboat Devil's Canyon Adventure
   2. NOTE: I offered doing Talkeetna Air Taxi's flightseeing tour - but I think they want a Helicopter.
   3. Not sure what else can really do here
5. Denali Princess Wilderness Lodge - July 29 afternoon - July 31 AM
   1. Included Denali Natural History Tour - Upgrade to Tundra Wilderness vs Kantishna
   2. Not sure if there's something to fit in July 29 afternoon

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

511,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, love",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

Since we met there, we thought it would be sweet.
 
I've always been an avid xcountry skier, and she's good at both, but neither of us have ever done an overnight winter backcountry trip. We do have lots of experience in cold weather though ( lived in fbx) and we love to backpack. 

Through reccomendationa from friends, we decided to celebrate by doing a part of ressurection pass: the north entrance to Caribou Creek Cabin ( 7 -8 miles). 

I haven't seen much info on doing this part in the winter. 

Anyone have any experience with this trail? Are we being stupid going this time of year?

Also I'd love any tips in general for back country ski trips.",2023-11-07 21:36:59
513,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, love",Sightseeing late September (extending work trip),"First of all, I completely understand that the last week of September means potentially rainy weather, closures, and a limit on some of the typical Alaskan experiences tourists like myself might experience in the summer months. That said, I’m in anchorage for work, the dates are set, and I plan to extend the visit with my wife (both early thirties). 

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time. 

Appreciate any guidance this group can provide. Have visited Alaska before, love it, and can’t wait to be back with my wife.",2023-08-13 20:54:47

I have an all day Kenai Fjords boat tour booked on one of the very small boats. The marine forecast has turned and we may not be able to get to Aialik Bay. My question is- do you think the benefits of a small boat tour make it worth it to keep this booking and possibly stay in Resurrection Bay? Or should I go with a larger boat that is not quite so weather dependent? I'm in it more for the wildlife possibilities, especially since the fog might make scenery visibility nil. 
But as you all know, the small boat tours are $$$ compared to the big boys and this was one of the biggest splurges of our trip.

518,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, love",Questions in advance of trip,"I’m currently planning a two-week trip to Alaska with my girlfriend (August 8-21). At the moment, specific timing is mostly up in the air, but we’re 100% planning on Denali, Seward, and some day trips near Anchorage. While the flair is mostly tongue-in-cheek - I always try to do my own research before asking questions on Reddit - I still have a few questions either based on what I’ve read or that I couldn’t find online:

* I was seeing a lot of recommendations to book things in advance, but I want to be flexible in case of inclement weather (plus, still figuring out the itinerary). That said, for a lot of the things I was looking at (flightseeing, Kenai Fjords, trains, various kayaking trips, etc.), there’s plenty of availability, even if I wanted to go tomorrow or next week. Is it still advisable to book things weeks in advance, or would a few days suffice at this point? Is there a bigger tourist spike in August?

* I’ll be doing the Skinny Raven Half on 8/20 and want to try to keep my training up. While I feel decent about running opportunities in Anchorage (within downtown or in parks), I wanted to see if there would be similar opportunities near Denali or Seward - I’m used to road running, but I can do paved or even trails. I figured that Seward would be easy enough to just run around downtown, but I’m a bit iffy on Denali - one idea I had was running up and down Parks Highway for a few miles, but if this is a moronic idea, I’d definitely like to know (and also understand what to expect in terms of wildlife). 

* On another note, based on what I saw from a previous post, bear spray is advisable for runs - I wanted to confirm that this is the case even in Anchorage and Seward. Already planning on no headphones, but open to other recommendations and advice from runners, since I’m so used to running in cities and city parks. 

* Finally, I’ve done some baseline research, but I’m always up for any suggestions for restaurants and breweries, anywhere between Denali and Seward - especially love unique local food and smaller neighborhood brewpubs whose products I would never find out of state. If any of you have places you want to shout out, would love to hear about it!

Thanks in advance - can’t wait to visit!",2023-07-22 16:23:23
519,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, hate",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

521,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
522,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, hate",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice?

527,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

528,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, enjoy",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
529,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, enjoy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
530,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, enjoy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

I do photography so any related suggestions there would be great.

535,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, enjoy",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

536,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, enjoy","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57
537,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

538,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, happy",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50
539,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, happy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
540,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, happy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

As the title states, I’m wondering if folks have any idea of work that would allow me to travel the Aleutian Islands?

Long story short, I grew up in Alaska and have since moved away. The last year or so I have been feeling the urge to swim back upstream (sorry, couldn’t resist) but would like to explore someplace new.  

I’m definitely not into working in a cannery and I don’t know how I’d fair on a fishing boat but other than those two, if I get to be outside I’m into it.

Not that it’s directly applicable but I’ve been a wildland firefighter these last eight years so hard work and weather won’t scare me off. In fact, I think I’d be most happy camping and hiking heavy loads through the wilderness.

Thanks for any suggestions!",2023-03-24 06:11:20
543,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, annoyed",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles.

There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

544,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, comfortable",Which UHaul Trailer should I choose for the Alaska Highway?,"Driving the Alaska highway down to the lower 48 from AK this August. Have a 2022 Ford Escape and more specifically the 4 cylinder AWD Hybrid model. Ford advertises that I should have around 1500 lb towing capacity and that a small teardrop trailer is fine to tow. I'm looking into getting the UHaul trailer hitch installed that has a 4500 lb capacity. There are two trailers from UHaul that I think I should be comfortable to tow. I'm waffling between the 4x8 and the 5x8 enclosed trailers they have to offer. The 4x8 already weighs around 850lbs and the 5x8 listed as 900lbs. So I was thinking to be safe and within 80% of my towing capacity it only gives me between 300 - 350 lbs depending on which model I were to choose. 

My biggest question for the group is whether or not the 4x8 or 5x8 would be reasonable on the Alaska Highway. It's not my first time driving it so I do remember the steep hills, which is a cause of my concern. If there was anyone with advice weather the 5x8 would be better off than the 4x8 or vice-a-versa it would be greatly appreciated. 

  
I have already looked into possibly pulling my car via their 10ft box trailer and it comes out closer to $3k which is less appealing.

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50
546,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, love","what ""Alaskan"" thing do you find yourself explaining to outsiders most often?","I love telling people all about Alaska, but there are some things I have to repeat more often than I'd like. For instance: the daylight situation. I get asked variations of the **""isn't it light/dark all the time up there?""** question so frequently that I've memorized the sunrise and sunset times in southcentral during the summer and winter solstices.

**""How can you sleep in the summer?""** - Blackout curtains.

**""How do you deal with the darkness in the winter?""** - SAD lamps if sheer optimism won't cut it.

**""That must be so strange for you!""** - Nope, I was born there, *your* daylight hours are strange to me. 

What do you end up explaining about Alaska over and over again?

Then I went to Fairbanks and wow it's like 86 out here and I have to wear shorts!  As a Texan this shocked me.

I didnt have enough time to visit the far north.

At any rate, I absolutely love your state.  Alaska truly is the last frontier and it's beauty was far greater than I anticipated.  My closest experience to you guys was Colorado but I have to say that Alaska blows Colorado out of the water.  Dont take your state for granted guys, there is stunning beauty everywhere you look that makes all the other states very jealous!

550,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, love",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

551,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, love","Moving up in August, y'all are freaking me out (please reassure)","Hi folks! 

My husband and I accepted great jobs in the Anchorage area and are moving up in August. 

I've been really excited about it, but now that we're getting close, we have had so many friends/family be super negative about it and then I also keep seeing posts here about how miserable and awful it is and I'm freaking out a bit. 

I know that it's dark/cold right now and has been for a few months and that the negativity is condensed because no one comes on the internet to say how okay and normal everything is going. 

Info about our situation:

-We've been up twice, late October and late November and loved the beauty and nature even though it was damp and we liked the friendly but kinda gritty/crusty/real vibe of the people we met. 

-The pay is great. We will have more than enough to cover the increased cost of living, rapidly pay off student loans, save up for a house, go on a sunny vacation or two in the winter and most importantly - leave if we hate it. 

-We are outdoorsy homebodies that like hiking, fishing and camping and recently picked up snowshoeing for a winter sport. We've lived all over the country, have snow driving experience, and the other jobs we were considering were actually way, way more rural even though they were in the lower 48. 

-Kinda freaked out by bears, earthquakes and avalanches but I'm sure we'll get over it.

Anyways, thank you for reading my crazy rambling and please tell me it will all be okay :)",2023-03-08 04:26:24
552,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, love",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).

556,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

558,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, love",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty.

I have been doing as much research as I can online about what would be the best path for me to take to become a Bush Pilot in God's country. Should I do my flight school here in Central VA or move to Anchorage or Fairbanks, get a welding job and take flight school there since I'll be more adjusted to the weather Alaska will have to offer during my training? I want to be apart of this community, it can sound campy and probably just spew from someone who's young and dumb (I'm 25 as of posting this) but the allure of being someone that can take hunters, researchers, hikers, campers, and guides out to difficult spots and to assist in bringing supplies to communities, helping others out, being apart of something great is constantly drumming at my soul. I am at a stage of analysis paralysis and there's contradictory information out there on which is the best path. I don't want to take a lazy route, I want to earn this and be great to myself and others, I just want to know the best way to go about it. 

Thank you for y'alls time and I hope I got the wording of this out. If it helps any extra on where I'd like to make a more permanent living, the south east to south central parts of the state is what's attractive to me as a place for home but that can change once in the motion and falling in love with another spot. 

Again thank you all for your time!",2024-04-28 20:59:03

I just got a gig bartending up in Healy for the Summer season and I don't really know what to expect. I'm excited but I don't know anyone who has done anything like this. Living in California currently. I'll be arriving in Anchorage a few days early and doing some shopping at Costco, and some other stores if you guys have any recommendations.

**Anything I should buy here specifically before I leave?**

**What should I bring that I probably am not thinking about?**

**Is it ever shorts/ flipflop weather up there?**

**To anyone that's done this, or something similar, what's the crowd like? How's day to day?**

562,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

I worked in Alaska a number of years ago in soldotna, we are both Eastern WA natives, so cold and winter are normal for us and we are making a list of towns to check out. We are in our early 30’s with one child, we are moderate/libertarian politically, looking for a community but also large enough we would still have some stuff to do. Preferably coastal, would love to own a few acres out side town if possible. Professionally my wife has a criminal justice psychology degree but has worked in an receptionist/insurance for years. I’m a diesel mechanic but have a side business in videography. We are aware of the winter darkness, midnight sun and possibility of owning boat rather than a car lol we are reaching a point we would like to unplug from the rat race and be a little more Simple and self sufficient. Sorry for the wordy post, thanks for any advice. Also please no anchorage lol",2023-09-07 06:21:01
564,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

This last time, moved away a year ago and am thinking about moving back. There’s so much I love about the state, and realize the lower 48 is over rated.

I was looking at housing in Palmer, Butte, and possibly as far south as Eagle River (but I don't know if the commute to Palmer is doable in the winter from there).  


I'm moving from the Dallas, TX area - so obviously, culture and environment shock. Originally I'm from a rural southern town though, so familiar with small town politics / community, having to hop in a car to go 15-20 minutes for groceries etc. I know that the winters are long and cold, and that summers are beautiful. I was in the Anchorage / Seward / Knik Glacier last summer, and it was obviously amazing in the summer. I know that glacier silt in the Mat-Su valley is a thing.

I have a young family of 5 (ages 5 thru 12), so I know getting plugged into a community quickly will be very important; but what are some other considerations for the area? Is Alaska, and this area, a good place to raise a family? We homeschool already, and generally have pretty conservative values, so is that a good fit for the area? Important question - Does Amazon ship there? :) 

From a 'being independent' perspective - what all would need to be purchased prior to moving to Alaska to be prepared for the environment: snow blower? Tire chains? We've all got decent cold weather gear from skiing, outdoor gear from family camping trips, firearms from years of hunting... but are there other major items you have to aquire to make it there?

572,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, love",October father-son visit suggested activities?,"My son (12) and I will be visiting Alaska Oct 18-24 ... flying into Fairbanks and out of Anchorage.  I'm looking for recommendations (food / sights / events / lodging / side trips).  We'd like to get a ""real Alaska"" perspective and understand that this isn't tourist season so the more popular stuff isn't active.  

My current plan is to rent a car, two days in Fairbanks, overnight near Denali, a day in Wasilla or Anchorage, a day in Seward, then back to Anchorage.  

We are both into astronomy, so dark skies and northern lights are part of the attraction.  We are also interested in engineering, for example we recently visited NASA Houston, SpaceX Boca Chica TX , an aircraft carrier in San Diego, and an oil drilling rig. So something ""tech-y"" along those lines might be of interest.  

Is driving through Denali reasonable at this time of year? We are from Minnesota and I understand winter driving. What is the likelihood of heavy weather / road closures?

573,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, love",Excursion Recommendations - Planning for Parents,"Hi Everyone,

I am planning an Alaska Cruise for my parents. I've booked a Cruise and Land Tour via Princess on the Sapphire from July 20 - Aug 1, 2024. I would love to hear people's thoughts on the comments, excursions picked, and if they would swap it out for any other experiences. My parent's do not have any mobility issues, but are also in their 70s and not the most active. They could do a few miles hiking, but would nothing too adventurous and wouldn't want my Mom on uneven terrain for too long.  Also, my Mom is vegetarian.

1. Ketchikan - July 22 - 6:00 AM - 2:00 PM
   1. Saxman Native Village, Dance Performance & Totem Park via Princess
   2. Spend remaining time exploring the town and lunch (Annabelle's vs Alaska Fish House)
   3. NOTE: I would love for them to do an easy hike that would allow them to see some scenery and possibly wildlife. In an ideal world, they would do some Bear viewing tour, but those are all 400-1000 bucks, which is out of budget for this port.
   4. NOTE #2: I offered for them to do the Misty Fjords Seaplane, and because they're doing the helicopter tour and a boat tour later on, decided against it. I could persuade them if people felt strongly about it.
2. Juneau - July 23, - 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM
   1. Harv and Marv's Whale Watching Tour - 10:30 AM - 2:30 PM
   2. Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Park + Nugget Fall's
   3. Rest of time exploring Juneau with Dinner at Tracy's?
   4. NOTE: I offered doing Whale Watching + Helicopter here - but they didn't want to pack the day with too many things since it's a long trip.
3. Skagway - July 24 - 7:00 AM - 8:30 PM
   1. TEMSCO Glacier Helicopter Tour - one benefit of this is that if it gets canceled due to weather, they could be rescheduled for the Denali Helicopter Tour later on
   2. Some other activity? - Klondike Summit/Suspension Bridge?
4. Mt. McKinley Wilderness Lodge (nearest excursion site is Talkeetna?) - July 27 afternoon through July 29 morning
   1. Mahay's Riverboat Devil's Canyon Adventure
   2. NOTE: I offered doing Talkeetna Air Taxi's flightseeing tour - but I think they want a Helicopter.
   3. Not sure what else can really do here
5. Denali Princess Wilderness Lodge - July 29 afternoon - July 31 AM
   1. Included Denali Natural History Tour - Upgrade to Tundra Wilderness vs Kantishna
   2. Not sure if there's something to fit in July 29 afternoon

I appreciate any help or suggestions-  thank you!",2024-01-17 04:20:52
574,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, love",Things to do around Anchorage in early April?,"Hi Alaskans, I read a few tourist websites( [https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/](https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/)) that recommend visiting Anchorage in March/April. I have never been to Alaska and I have been on the mid atlantic since forever. What are your remmendations for things to do around this time of year?

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

575,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, love",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

Since we met there, we thought it would be sweet.
 
I've always been an avid xcountry skier, and she's good at both, but neither of us have ever done an overnight winter backcountry trip. We do have lots of experience in cold weather though ( lived in fbx) and we love to backpack. 

Through reccomendationa from friends, we decided to celebrate by doing a part of ressurection pass: the north entrance to Caribou Creek Cabin ( 7 -8 miles). 

I haven't seen much info on doing this part in the winter. 

Anyone have any experience with this trail? Are we being stupid going this time of year?

Also I'd love any tips in general for back country ski trips.",2023-11-07 21:36:59
577,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, love",Sightseeing late September (extending work trip),"First of all, I completely understand that the last week of September means potentially rainy weather, closures, and a limit on some of the typical Alaskan experiences tourists like myself might experience in the summer months. That said, I’m in anchorage for work, the dates are set, and I plan to extend the visit with my wife (both early thirties). 

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time. 

Appreciate any guidance this group can provide. Have visited Alaska before, love it, and can’t wait to be back with my wife.",2023-08-13 20:54:47

I have an all day Kenai Fjords boat tour booked on one of the very small boats. The marine forecast has turned and we may not be able to get to Aialik Bay. My question is- do you think the benefits of a small boat tour make it worth it to keep this booking and possibly stay in Resurrection Bay? Or should I go with a larger boat that is not quite so weather dependent? I'm in it more for the wildlife possibilities, especially since the fog might make scenery visibility nil. 
But as you all know, the small boat tours are $$$ compared to the big boys and this was one of the biggest splurges of our trip.

582,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, love",Questions in advance of trip,"I’m currently planning a two-week trip to Alaska with my girlfriend (August 8-21). At the moment, specific timing is mostly up in the air, but we’re 100% planning on Denali, Seward, and some day trips near Anchorage. While the flair is mostly tongue-in-cheek - I always try to do my own research before asking questions on Reddit - I still have a few questions either based on what I’ve read or that I couldn’t find online:

* I was seeing a lot of recommendations to book things in advance, but I want to be flexible in case of inclement weather (plus, still figuring out the itinerary). That said, for a lot of the things I was looking at (flightseeing, Kenai Fjords, trains, various kayaking trips, etc.), there’s plenty of availability, even if I wanted to go tomorrow or next week. Is it still advisable to book things weeks in advance, or would a few days suffice at this point? Is there a bigger tourist spike in August?

* I’ll be doing the Skinny Raven Half on 8/20 and want to try to keep my training up. While I feel decent about running opportunities in Anchorage (within downtown or in parks), I wanted to see if there would be similar opportunities near Denali or Seward - I’m used to road running, but I can do paved or even trails. I figured that Seward would be easy enough to just run around downtown, but I’m a bit iffy on Denali - one idea I had was running up and down Parks Highway for a few miles, but if this is a moronic idea, I’d definitely like to know (and also understand what to expect in terms of wildlife). 

* On another note, based on what I saw from a previous post, bear spray is advisable for runs - I wanted to confirm that this is the case even in Anchorage and Seward. Already planning on no headphones, but open to other recommendations and advice from runners, since I’m so used to running in cities and city parks. 

* Finally, I’ve done some baseline research, but I’m always up for any suggestions for restaurants and breweries, anywhere between Denali and Seward - especially love unique local food and smaller neighborhood brewpubs whose products I would never find out of state. If any of you have places you want to shout out, would love to hear about it!

Thanks in advance - can’t wait to visit!",2023-07-22 16:23:23
583,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
584,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, hate",Sorry but as someone who grew up in Alaska...,"It makes me feel so validated when I see people responding to the ""should I move here"" posts by saying absolutely not, it's depressing, dark and cold, get out while you can. Having spend 19 years there (against my will), agreed.

People are always asking me what it was like living in Alaska and I have a generic response about the beautiful nature and small island I'm from, but really it is ROUGH especially if you're not the exact type of person who wants to live there.

Edit: forgot to mention that at least in my town, outsiders are truly hated sometimes and when people move there it's actually horrifying seeing how they are treated. It's like the locals want to drive everyone out of town. It took my mom a year to even make friends there when she moved because so many people were trashing her saying there was no way she'd make it and that she would leave soon, then she ended up staying and became good friends with everyone. She tells that story like it's nice but it actually shows how unwelcoming it is. Maybe it's just my town that's that way, but jfc I could go onnn.",2023-11-02 21:26:08
585,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, hate",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

588,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, hate","Moving up in August, y'all are freaking me out (please reassure)","Hi folks! 

My husband and I accepted great jobs in the Anchorage area and are moving up in August. 

I've been really excited about it, but now that we're getting close, we have had so many friends/family be super negative about it and then I also keep seeing posts here about how miserable and awful it is and I'm freaking out a bit. 

I know that it's dark/cold right now and has been for a few months and that the negativity is condensed because no one comes on the internet to say how okay and normal everything is going. 

Info about our situation:

-We've been up twice, late October and late November and loved the beauty and nature even though it was damp and we liked the friendly but kinda gritty/crusty/real vibe of the people we met. 

-The pay is great. We will have more than enough to cover the increased cost of living, rapidly pay off student loans, save up for a house, go on a sunny vacation or two in the winter and most importantly - leave if we hate it. 

-We are outdoorsy homebodies that like hiking, fishing and camping and recently picked up snowshoeing for a winter sport. We've lived all over the country, have snow driving experience, and the other jobs we were considering were actually way, way more rural even though they were in the lower 48. 

-Kinda freaked out by bears, earthquakes and avalanches but I'm sure we'll get over it.

2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

592,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, hate",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice? 

Thanks!  ",2024-02-28 18:41:22

594,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, hate",Palmer-Wasilla job opportunity,"I've recently been presented with a possible opportunity to move to the Palmer-Wasilla area, and looking for what the reality is of moving from the lower 48 to that area. I was looking at housing in Palmer, Butte, and possibly as far south as Eagle River (but I don't know if the commute to Palmer is doable in the winter from there).  


I'm moving from the Dallas, TX area - so obviously, culture and environment shock. Originally I'm from a rural southern town though, so familiar with small town politics / community, having to hop in a car to go 15-20 minutes for groceries etc. I know that the winters are long and cold, and that summers are beautiful. I was in the Anchorage / Seward / Knik Glacier last summer, and it was obviously amazing in the summer. I know that glacier silt in the Mat-Su valley is a thing.

I have a young family of 5 (ages 5 thru 12), so I know getting plugged into a community quickly will be very important; but what are some other considerations for the area? Is Alaska, and this area, a good place to raise a family? We homeschool already, and generally have pretty conservative values, so is that a good fit for the area? Important question - Does Amazon ship there? :) 

From a 'being independent' perspective - what all would need to be purchased prior to moving to Alaska to be prepared for the environment: snow blower? Tire chains? We've all got decent cold weather gear from skiing, outdoor gear from family camping trips, firearms from years of hunting... but are there other major items you have to aquire to make it there?

I feel like I'm smart enough to know, that I don't know nearly enough about the area - so, grateful for whatever help anyone can provide. ",2024-03-15 21:58:19

We'd like to get a ""real Alaska"" perspective and understand that this isn't tourist season so the more popular stuff isn't active.  

My current plan is to rent a car, two days in Fairbanks, overnight near Denali, a day in Wasilla or Anchorage, a day in Seward, then back to Anchorage.  

We are both into astronomy, so dark skies and northern lights are part of the attraction.  We are also interested in engineering, for example we recently visited NASA Houston, SpaceX Boca Chica TX , an aircraft carrier in San Diego, and an oil drilling rig. So something ""tech-y"" along those lines might be of interest.  

Is driving through Denali reasonable at this time of year? We are from Minnesota and I understand winter driving. What is the likelihood of heavy weather / road closures?

601,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, enjoy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
602,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, enjoy",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

605,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

606,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, enjoy",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

608,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, enjoy",Palmer-Wasilla job opportunity,"I've recently been presented with a possible opportunity to move to the Palmer-Wasilla area, and looking for what the reality is of moving from the lower 48 to that area. I was looking at housing in Palmer, Butte, and possibly as far south as Eagle River (but I don't know if the commute to Palmer is doable in the winter from there).  


I'm moving from the Dallas, TX area - so obviously, culture and environment shock. Originally I'm from a rural southern town though, so familiar with small town politics / community, having to hop in a car to go 15-20 minutes for groceries etc. I know that the winters are long and cold, and that summers are beautiful. I was in the Anchorage / Seward / Knik Glacier last summer, and it was obviously amazing in the summer. I know that glacier silt in the Mat-Su valley is a thing.

I have a young family of 5 (ages 5 thru 12), so I know getting plugged into a community quickly will be very important; but what are some other considerations for the area? Is Alaska, and this area, a good place to raise a family? We homeschool already, and generally have pretty conservative values, so is that a good fit for the area? Important question - Does Amazon ship there? :) 

From a 'being independent' perspective - what all would need to be purchased prior to moving to Alaska to be prepared for the environment: snow blower? Tire chains? We've all got decent cold weather gear from skiing, outdoor gear from family camping trips, firearms from years of hunting... but are there other major items you have to aquire to make it there?

I feel like I'm smart enough to know, that I don't know nearly enough about the area - so, grateful for whatever help anyone can provide. ",2024-03-15 21:58:19

I'm looking for recommendations (food / sights / events / lodging / side trips).  We'd like to get a ""real Alaska"" perspective and understand that this isn't tourist season so the more popular stuff isn't active.  

My current plan is to rent a car, two days in Fairbanks, overnight near Denali, a day in Wasilla or Anchorage, a day in Seward, then back to Anchorage.  

We are both into astronomy, so dark skies and northern lights are part of the attraction.  We are also interested in engineering, for example we recently visited NASA Houston, SpaceX Boca Chica TX , an aircraft carrier in San Diego, and an oil drilling rig. So something ""tech-y"" along those lines might be of interest.  

Is driving through Denali reasonable at this time of year? We are from Minnesota and I understand winter driving. What is the likelihood of heavy weather / road closures?

Will be in Anchorage, Denali, and Kenai. Please throw in any local recommendations on food/bars/attractions. 

I do photography so any related suggestions there would be great. Also, wondering about how easy it is to find fellow locals who’d be down to exploring or chilling, just curious as to the culture as well. Since, I am by myself it would be exciting to find likeminded people who enjoy outdoors and learn about Alaska with them.

614,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, enjoy",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

615,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, enjoy","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57
616,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, dislike",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

618,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, dislike",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24

My current plan is to rent a car, two days in Fairbanks, overnight near Denali, a day in Wasilla or Anchorage, a day in Seward, then back to Anchorage.  

We are both into astronomy, so dark skies and northern lights are part of the attraction.

621,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, annoying",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

623,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

624,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, annoying",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

630,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, happy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

636,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, happy",Work in the Aleutian’s?,"Hello,

As the title states, I’m wondering if folks have any idea of work that would allow me to travel the Aleutian Islands?

Long story short, I grew up in Alaska and have since moved away. The last year or so I have been feeling the urge to swim back upstream (sorry, couldn’t resist) but would like to explore someplace new.  

I’m definitely not into working in a cannery and I don’t know how I’d fair on a fishing boat but other than those two, if I get to be outside I’m into it.

Not that it’s directly applicable but I’ve been a wildland firefighter these last eight years so hard work and weather won’t scare me off. In fact, I think I’d be most happy camping and hiking heavy loads through the wilderness.

Thanks for any suggestions!",2023-03-24 06:11:20
637,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, annoyed",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

639,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, annoyed",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

640,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, annoyed",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24

646,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, comfortable",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
647,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, comfortable",Which UHaul Trailer should I choose for the Alaska Highway?,"Driving the Alaska highway down to the lower 48 from AK this August. Have a 2022 Ford Escape and more specifically the 4 cylinder AWD Hybrid model. Ford advertises that I should have around 1500 lb towing capacity and that a small teardrop trailer is fine to tow. I'm looking into getting the UHaul trailer hitch installed that has a 4500 lb capacity. There are two trailers from UHaul that I think I should be comfortable to tow. I'm waffling between the 4x8 and the 5x8 enclosed trailers they have to offer. The 4x8 already weighs around 850lbs and the 5x8 listed as 900lbs. So I was thinking to be safe and within 80% of my towing capacity it only gives me between 300 - 350 lbs depending on which model I were to choose. 

My biggest question for the group is whether or not the 4x8 or 5x8 would be reasonable on the Alaska Highway. It's not my first time driving it so I do remember the steep hills, which is a cause of my concern. If there was anyone with advice weather the 5x8 would be better off than the 4x8 or vice-a-versa it would be greatly appreciated. 

  
I have already looked into possibly pulling my car via their 10ft box trailer and it comes out closer to $3k which is less appealing.   


Thank you!",2024-05-30 02:45:06
648,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, comfortable",Palmer-Wasilla job opportunity,"I've recently been presented with a possible opportunity to move to the Palmer-Wasilla area, and looking for what the reality is of moving from the lower 48 to that area. I was looking at housing in Palmer, Butte, and possibly as far south as Eagle River (but I don't know if the commute to Palmer is doable in the winter from there).  


I'm moving from the Dallas, TX area - so obviously, culture and environment shock. Originally I'm from a rural southern town though, so familiar with small town politics / community, having to hop in a car to go 15-20 minutes for groceries etc. I know that the winters are long and cold, and that summers are beautiful. I was in the Anchorage / Seward / Knik Glacier last summer, and it was obviously amazing in the summer. I know that glacier silt in the Mat-Su valley is a thing.

I have a young family of 5 (ages 5 thru 12), so I know getting plugged into a community quickly will be very important; but what are some other considerations for the area? Is Alaska, and this area, a good place to raise a family? We homeschool already, and generally have pretty conservative values, so is that a good fit for the area? Important question - Does Amazon ship there? :) 

From a 'being independent' perspective - what all would need to be purchased prior to moving to Alaska to be prepared for the environment: snow blower? Tire chains? We've all got decent cold weather gear from skiing, outdoor gear from family camping trips, firearms from years of hunting... but are there other major items you have to aquire to make it there?

I feel like I'm smart enough to know, that I don't know nearly enough about the area - so, grateful for whatever help anyone can provide. ",2024-03-15 21:58:19
649,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, comfortable",October father-son visit suggested activities?,"My son (12) and I will be visiting Alaska Oct 18-24 ... flying into Fairbanks and out of Anchorage.  I'm looking for recommendations (food / sights / events / lodging / side trips).  We'd like to get a ""real Alaska"" perspective and understand that this isn't tourist season so the more popular stuff isn't active.  

My current plan is to rent a car, two days in Fairbanks, overnight near Denali, a day in Wasilla or Anchorage, a day in Seward, then back to Anchorage.  

We are both into astronomy, so dark skies and northern lights are part of the attraction.  We are also interested in engineering, for example we recently visited NASA Houston, SpaceX Boca Chica TX , an aircraft carrier in San Diego, and an oil drilling rig. So something ""tech-y"" along those lines might be of interest.  

Is driving through Denali reasonable at this time of year? We are from Minnesota and I understand winter driving. What is the likelihood of heavy weather / road closures?

650,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, cloudy, love","Thinking of moving, need ideas","30f. The long, cold, dark winters seem to be getting worse and I need new scenery (physically and mentally) to grow as a person and gain more experience. 

I love the small town feel of the valley while still having access to decent amenities. 

I can’t do big cities and spend an hour in traffic every day. 

I would like a location with no more than 4 months of snow, rain, or ice seasons. 

But not regular temperatures over 90. 

I appreciate all ideas!",2024-08-19 00:36:39
651,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, cloudy, love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
652,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, cloudy, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

653,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, cloudy, love",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

I have never been to Alaska and I have been on the mid atlantic since forever. What are your remmendations for things to do around this time of year?

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

656,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, cloudy, love",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

657,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, cloudy, hate",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice? 

Thanks!  ",2024-02-28 18:41:22
658,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, cloudy, enjoy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

660,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, cloudy, happy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
661,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, cloudy, comfortable",Dry cabin + toyo heater. What temperature?,"First year in AK. Incredible summer. Now that the heater is on, Im going through fuel a little faster than I expected. Obviously I want to balance efficiency and comfort. 

When I leave for work or errands, I turn it down to 50F. When I'm home, 68 is almost tolerable with warm layers. But I find that most of the time it's not quite comfortable. 70 feels great, and I'm concerned about costs, but a few dollars a month is maybe worth not being uncomfortable.

What do you set yours at?",2024-10-10 04:15:44
662,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, cloudy, comfortable",Moving to Homer. Is it hard to get a greenhorn job on a commercial fishing boat?,"This is something I have been planning for a while now and I have been lurking on this sub reading all of the 'I'm moving to Alaska' posts for a while now.

I have a job lined up on a large factory trawler that operates out of Dutch.  The wait time to get on a vessel is up to 8 months.  I have a GMC cargo van which I am perfectly comfortable living out of.  I have everything I need to keep warm and I have plenty of experience maintaining engines and vehicles in sub zero temperatures.  I also have enough money to get to Homer and ferry my van to Dutch if that's what I decide to do.  I have enough saved to live comfortably and pay for fuel/food/living expenses and extensive engine/vehicle repairs on my van if needed.  I can survive for a year and have enough to get back to main land and back to lower 48 if things don't work out.  

I have plenty of experience working 12+ hours/day in sub zero temperatures.

My dream is to work on a vessel in the Bering Sea.  I don't have much experience on boats.  Just a few fishing charters in the Atlantic in not so rough waters.

How hard would it be for me to find a greenhorn job on a commercial vessel out of Homer before I start my employment on a factory vessel in Dutch?  Any tips on how to get a job quickly when I get there?  Is it better to just go straight to Dutch and look for a job there?

I will be in Homer in 1 month.

Update:
After reading all of the comments about trawling vessels and doing a little research I’ve decided that’s not something I want to be a part of.  Probably the reason it was so easy to land that job is because they have a hard time finding people who are willing to do that type of fishing.  I really appreciate all of the feedback from everyone here.",2023-07-08 21:11:58
663,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, overcast, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

I would like a location with no more than 4 months of snow, rain, or ice seasons.

665,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, overcast, love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
666,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, overcast, love",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

668,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, overcast, hate",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

669,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, overcast, enjoy",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

672,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, overcast, annoying",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

677,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, overcast, comfortable",Moving to Homer. Is it hard to get a greenhorn job on a commercial fishing boat?,"This is something I have been planning for a while now and I have been lurking on this sub reading all of the 'I'm moving to Alaska' posts for a while now.

I have a job lined up on a large factory trawler that operates out of Dutch.  The wait time to get on a vessel is up to 8 months.  I have a GMC cargo van which I am perfectly comfortable living out of.  I have everything I need to keep warm and I have plenty of experience maintaining engines and vehicles in sub zero temperatures.  I also have enough money to get to Homer and ferry my van to Dutch if that's what I decide to do.  I have enough saved to live comfortably and pay for fuel/food/living expenses and extensive engine/vehicle repairs on my van if needed.  I can survive for a year and have enough to get back to main land and back to lower 48 if things don't work out.  

I have plenty of experience working 12+ hours/day in sub zero temperatures.

My dream is to work on a vessel in the Bering Sea.  I don't have much experience on boats.  Just a few fishing charters in the Atlantic in not so rough waters.

How hard would it be for me to find a greenhorn job on a commercial vessel out of Homer before I start my employment on a factory vessel in Dutch?  Any tips on how to get a job quickly when I get there?  Is it better to just go straight to Dutch and look for a job there?

I will be in Homer in 1 month.

Update:
After reading all of the comments about trawling vessels and doing a little research I’ve decided that’s not something I want to be a part of.  Probably the reason it was so easy to land that job is because they have a hard time finding people who are willing to do that type of fishing.  I really appreciate all of the feedback from everyone here.",2023-07-08 21:11:58

It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

680,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, grey, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

681,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, grey, love",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

684,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, grey, happy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots.

When I leave for work or errands, I turn it down to 50F. When I'm home, 68 is almost tolerable with warm layers. But I find that most of the time it's not quite comfortable. 70 feels great, and I'm concerned about costs, but a few dollars a month is maybe worth not being uncomfortable.

686,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, grey, comfortable",Moving to Homer. Is it hard to get a greenhorn job on a commercial fishing boat?,"This is something I have been planning for a while now and I have been lurking on this sub reading all of the 'I'm moving to Alaska' posts for a while now.

I have a job lined up on a large factory trawler that operates out of Dutch.  The wait time to get on a vessel is up to 8 months.  I have a GMC cargo van which I am perfectly comfortable living out of.  I have everything I need to keep warm and I have plenty of experience maintaining engines and vehicles in sub zero temperatures.  I also have enough money to get to Homer and ferry my van to Dutch if that's what I decide to do.  I have enough saved to live comfortably and pay for fuel/food/living expenses and extensive engine/vehicle repairs on my van if needed.  I can survive for a year and have enough to get back to main land and back to lower 48 if things don't work out.  

I have plenty of experience working 12+ hours/day in sub zero temperatures.

My dream is to work on a vessel in the Bering Sea.  I don't have much experience on boats.  Just a few fishing charters in the Atlantic in not so rough waters.

How hard would it be for me to find a greenhorn job on a commercial vessel out of Homer before I start my employment on a factory vessel in Dutch?  Any tips on how to get a job quickly when I get there?  Is it better to just go straight to Dutch and look for a job there?

I will be in Homer in 1 month.

Update:
After reading all of the comments about trawling vessels and doing a little research I’ve decided that’s not something I want to be a part of.  Probably the reason it was so easy to land that job is because they have a hard time finding people who are willing to do that type of fishing.

688,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, gray, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

I was on a train, heading north from Talkeetna to the Princess Lodges at Denali, and I spent a majority of the ride on the viewing platform. I managed to get some decent video of scenery, but not much because I prefer to do my sightseeing without a phone or camera. Anyways, at one point, either soon before or soon after one of the bridges, I was looking out in the distance and there was a valley-ish looking area and [judging by distance] there was a pretty large ""base"" of weird looking ""silos."" At first glance I thought grain silos, but the more I looked at it [it was only in sight for about 15, probably] the more industrial and more out of place it seemed. So I immediatelt went to google Earth to see what it was, and NOTHING but trees and mountain showed up. Of course my dumbass forgot to drop a pin and save the coords, but does anyone who lives in the area or been on that railroad track have any idea what it couldve been?

696,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, clouds, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth.

For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

709,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, dull, happy",Looking to move to Anchorage from Las Vegas...,"OK, so long story short, I'm just not happy with my current life situation and a big play in that mentally is living in this sand trap desert. I could write a book on why, but I'll save all that typing.

I don't have much experience moving such a distance, especially by myself. I moved to Texas after HS and back to Vegas after graduation so that's really it. But to go as far as the \*real\* North.. I don't even know where to begin. How do I figure out housing, job, and other types of expenses (plus the whole moving process in general) with a state I have 0 - 2% knowledge of and is what feels like 2x planets away? Like, do I need a passport to drive there since I would have to go through Canada? Could I take a boat there instead? Or would I even want to take a boat there to begin with..? Sounds stupid but I'm just giving half-ass examples of what I think going about such a decision is going to take.

But again, I have no idea. Alaska in general will be a whole new world (again) for me. Reason why I'd like to settle there, reset my life and forget the past, even if it's just a little. My gut tells me Alaska is that place I'm trying to find. But hey, maybe it will be; maybe it won't be...

What I do believe is that it'll be a place I could start another new chapter in my life. Like, do I want to settle with my current stagnating position, living life so dull and alone one could argue it's a pointless existence..? Maybe the opportunities I've been looking for all these years are here... So, any type of advice is greatly appreciated!

Update: 7:21 PST 05/18: Wow... The amount of passive-aggressive responses in such a short time to a non-hostile, non-offending, general question of a post really says something. 2014 Reddit and 2024 Reddit really have became two different places. If anything, I'm more so dumbfounded on the idea that I've lived long enough to see such a thing go about.

But whatever... If clicking on an arrow aiming down gives you the rock dick of a lifetime who am I to give a s\* about. lol

Update: 9:00 - 08 PM PST Same Day: Well, I hope these thread proved entertaining for some of you, lol. But I am tired now and going to sleep. To those that actually have a sense of compassion I appreciate the advice regardless of cautionary level. For those who have messaged me, I'll give a response tomorrow by noon.

I have a job lined up on a large factory trawler that operates out of Dutch.  The wait time to get on a vessel is up to 8 months.  I have a GMC cargo van which I am perfectly comfortable living out of.  I have everything I need to keep warm and I have plenty of experience maintaining engines and vehicles in sub zero temperatures.

I have enough saved to live comfortably and pay for fuel/food/living expenses and extensive engine/vehicle repairs on my van if needed.  I can survive for a year and have enough to get back to main land and back to lower 48 if things don't work out.  

I have plenty of experience working 12+ hours/day in sub zero temperatures.

My dream is to work on a vessel in the Bering Sea.  I don't have much experience on boats.  Just a few fishing charters in the Atlantic in not so rough waters.

How hard would it be for me to find a greenhorn job on a commercial vessel out of Homer before I start my employment on a factory vessel in Dutch?  Any tips on how to get a job quickly when I get there?  Is it better to just go straight to Dutch and look for a job there?

I will be in Homer in 1 month.

Update:
After reading all of the comments about trawling vessels and doing a little research I’ve decided that’s not something I want to be a part of.

Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

Is it hard to get a greenhorn job on a commercial fishing boat?,"This is something I have been planning for a while now and I have been lurking on this sub reading all of the 'I'm moving to Alaska' posts for a while now.

I have a job lined up on a large factory trawler that operates out of Dutch.  The wait time to get on a vessel is up to 8 months.  I have a GMC cargo van which I am perfectly comfortable living out of.  I have everything I need to keep warm and I have plenty of experience maintaining engines and vehicles in sub zero temperatures.  I also have enough money to get to Homer and ferry my van to Dutch if that's what I decide to do.  I have enough saved to live comfortably and pay for fuel/food/living expenses and extensive engine/vehicle repairs on my van if needed.  I can survive for a year and have enough to get back to main land and back to lower 48 if things don't work out.  

I have plenty of experience working 12+ hours/day in sub zero temperatures.

My dream is to work on a vessel in the Bering Sea.  I don't have much experience on boats.  Just a few fishing charters in the Atlantic in not so rough waters.

How hard would it be for me to find a greenhorn job on a commercial vessel out of Homer before I start my employment on a factory vessel in Dutch?  Any tips on how to get a job quickly when I get there?  Is it better to just go straight to Dutch and look for a job there?

I will be in Homer in 1 month.

Update:
After reading all of the comments about trawling vessels and doing a little research I’ve decided that’s not something I want to be a part of.  Probably the reason it was so easy to land that job is because they have a hard time finding people who are willing to do that type of fishing.

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

I know that it's dark/cold right now and has been for a few months and that the negativity is condensed because no one comes on the internet to say how okay and normal everything is going. 

Info about our situation:

-We've been up twice, late October and late November and loved the beauty and nature even though it was damp and we liked the friendly but kinda gritty/crusty/real vibe of the people we met. 

-The pay is great. We will have more than enough to cover the increased cost of living, rapidly pay off student loans, save up for a house, go on a sunny vacation or two in the winter and most importantly - leave if we hate it. 

-We are outdoorsy homebodies that like hiking, fishing and camping and recently picked up snowshoeing for a winter sport. We've lived all over the country, have snow driving experience, and the other jobs we were considering were actually way, way more rural even though they were in the lower 48.

Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime.

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

734,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, dark, love",Interested in Moving,"Hi!!! I’m interested in moving to Alaska. Let me tell you about myself so you can give me some recommendations. I HATE the cold, it makes me feel so sad and shivery. I also don’t like snow, however I can tolerate it when it is still in the liquid form. All that aside, let me tell you about my favorite hobbies!! I hate skiing, sledding, snowboarding, fishing, Ice fishing, hiking, driving in any condition other than plain concrete, and bending over too much. It hurts my wee little back. On the contrary, I love tanning, surfing, scuba diving, dancing, and parasailing. Let me talk about my fears. Bears are so scary!!! Luckily there are none here right! 😁 Mosquitos scare me too, and so does the dark. Me and my family were looking at Utqiagvik, as i’m sure it has all my likings. What do you think?

I’ve driven the Alcan several times, but never that time of year.  I have a Tacoma with 4 wheel drive, winter tires, and I’ll def get some chains.

Any recommendations?  Should I do it, or should I fly up, and come back to grab my truck in April/May?

Having spend 19 years there (against my will), agreed.

People are always asking me what it was like living in Alaska and I have a generic response about the beautiful nature and small island I'm from, but really it is ROUGH especially if you're not the exact type of person who wants to live there.

Edit: forgot to mention that at least in my town, outsiders are truly hated sometimes and when people move there it's actually horrifying seeing how they are treated. It's like the locals want to drive everyone out of town. It took my mom a year to even make friends there when she moved because so many people were trashing her saying there was no way she'd make it and that she would leave soon, then she ended up staying and became good friends with everyone. She tells that story like it's nice but it actually shows how unwelcoming it is. Maybe it's just my town that's that way, but jfc I could go onnn.",2023-11-02 21:26:08

738,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, dark, hate","Moving up in August, y'all are freaking me out (please reassure)","Hi folks! 

My husband and I accepted great jobs in the Anchorage area and are moving up in August. 

I've been really excited about it, but now that we're getting close, we have had so many friends/family be super negative about it and then I also keep seeing posts here about how miserable and awful it is and I'm freaking out a bit. 

I know that it's dark/cold right now and has been for a few months and that the negativity is condensed because no one comes on the internet to say how okay and normal everything is going. 

Info about our situation:

-We've been up twice, late October and late November and loved the beauty and nature even though it was damp and we liked the friendly but kinda gritty/crusty/real vibe of the people we met. 

-The pay is great. We will have more than enough to cover the increased cost of living, rapidly pay off student loans, save up for a house, go on a sunny vacation or two in the winter and most importantly - leave if we hate it. 

-We are outdoorsy homebodies that like hiking, fishing and camping and recently picked up snowshoeing for a winter sport. We've lived all over the country, have snow driving experience, and the other jobs we were considering were actually way, way more rural even though they were in the lower 48. 

-Kinda freaked out by bears, earthquakes and avalanches but I'm sure we'll get over it.

Anyways, thank you for reading my crazy rambling and please tell me it will all be okay :)",2023-03-08 04:26:24

740,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, dark, hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24

749,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, dark, happy",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

>Alaskans, I have so much to thank you for.  
>  
>The past month has been one of the most difficult in my life. [Losing my husband](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/rural-alaska/2023/09/13/rep-mary-peltolas-husband-killed-in-plane-crash-in-alaska/), Buzzy, has changed me forever. Having lost my mother earlier this year, it was hard to imagine what my life would look like now without them.  
>  
>But in the darkest moments, you showed me such kindness and grace.  
>  
>Immediately after the news broke, you were calling my office to share your condolences and prayers. Our senators and governor reached out personally, offering support for my staff and family.  
>  
>In Bethel, you [packed Buzzy’s funeral](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2023/09/19/hundreds-of-mourners-gather-in-bethel-for-funeral-of-eugene-buzzy-peltola-jr/) with more people than I could have imagined. In Anchorage, his 40-day celebration was just as well-attended. Buzzy was someone who made an impression on everyone he met — and it seems like he had truly met everyone! The amount of wonderful stories I’ve heard from Alaskans about their experiences with him have helped me to see the love that he inspired in the world, and that has been truly healing for me.  
>  
>I am so thankful for the space that you have given me to celebrate Buzzy’s life with my family, and for all you who celebrated it with us. The warmth and generosity that you have shown represents Alaska at its best.  
>  
>While my life will never be the same, I am still deeply honored to serve as Alaska’s Representative, and I want you to know that your voices are being heard in Washington, D.C. I have been back in the Capitol, working to represent you and pass a budget that protects Alaska from an unnecessary government shutdown, creates jobs, and invests in our infrastructure and families. With a new Speaker, we have a chance for a new start.  
>  
>As I was in the process of returning to Washington, D.C., I was thinking a lot about why Alaska is different, and this is what I think. So many of the people who reached out to offer their support and comfort mentioned how they had gone through something similar — how they had known someone else who passed away doing something they loved in the great outdoors of our incredible state.  
>  
>**It made me realize at a deeper level something that I’ve always believed, which is that Alaskans care so deeply and naturally for each other because we face and understand so many of the same challenges. We know that we are a small population in a big state, and the neighbor we politically disagree with might also be the neighbor who we need to help pull us out of a snowbank or a river. That Alaska camaraderie is what has helped us establish a new model of politics, an “Alaska model” that prioritizes bipartisanship and unifying coalitions over division and blame-casting.**  
>  
>When I returned to Washington, D.C., I was expecting a return to the partisan atmosphere that has been all too common in our Capitol. But I was surprised by a wonderfully human moment — applause from both sides of the chamber as I cast my first vote for Speaker after taking time to grieve with my children.  
>  
>It was only one moment, but that simple human gesture of kindness meant the world to me, and it showed me that a better version of Congress — a more Alaskan version — is possible. If we can return to seeing each other as people, not as partisans, then our government can start to heal from dysfunction.  
>  
>Thank you once more to all those who offered their comfort and prayers. You have made a dark time just that much lighter and showed me again why I ran for this office in the first place.  
>  
>Buzzy spent his life serving and advocating for Alaskans, building relationships and bringing people together. While he may be gone, that spirit endures in so many Alaskans, and it will always be my north star.

758,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, dark, comfortable",Moving to Homer. Is it hard to get a greenhorn job on a commercial fishing boat?,"This is something I have been planning for a while now and I have been lurking on this sub reading all of the 'I'm moving to Alaska' posts for a while now.

I have a job lined up on a large factory trawler that operates out of Dutch.  The wait time to get on a vessel is up to 8 months.  I have a GMC cargo van which I am perfectly comfortable living out of.  I have everything I need to keep warm and I have plenty of experience maintaining engines and vehicles in sub zero temperatures.  I also have enough money to get to Homer and ferry my van to Dutch if that's what I decide to do.  I have enough saved to live comfortably and pay for fuel/food/living expenses and extensive engine/vehicle repairs on my van if needed.  I can survive for a year and have enough to get back to main land and back to lower 48 if things don't work out.  

I have plenty of experience working 12+ hours/day in sub zero temperatures.

My dream is to work on a vessel in the Bering Sea.  I don't have much experience on boats.  Just a few fishing charters in the Atlantic in not so rough waters.

How hard would it be for me to find a greenhorn job on a commercial vessel out of Homer before I start my employment on a factory vessel in Dutch?  Any tips on how to get a job quickly when I get there?  Is it better to just go straight to Dutch and look for a job there?

I will be in Homer in 1 month.

Update:
After reading all of the comments about trawling vessels and doing a little research I’ve decided that’s not something I want to be a part of.  Probably the reason it was so easy to land that job is because they have a hard time finding people who are willing to do that type of fishing.  I really appreciate all of the feedback from everyone here.",2023-07-08 21:11:58

How would today's modern EV's fare in North Dakota's cold winters?  What happens if one sits outside in sub zero degree temperatures for 8 hours while someone is at work or sits outside for a week?  (Not everyone has an insulated garage.)  Can you start one up at -10 degrees F without inflicting any damage on the batteries or the vehicle?  How will the cold affect the lifespan of the expensive batteries?  Will they lose their ability to provide range over time?

For info we were originally from the desert in AZ and I spent a  good portion of my time driving off anything resembling a road due to the environment we lived in.

1. We have a 2019 pickup that rests nightly outside. Last year I installed a trickle charger on it for the battery, but I am still having an issue with starting it on the cold mornings (starter turns fine, but it takes multiple attempts to cold start). Is this pretty normal and fine for weather like this, or is this something that could cause damage to the engine and I need to get a block heater? *Have gotten conflicting info on that one about people having block heaters on their newer trucks, even sitting outside.

2. My wife is looking for a new vehicle and is a tad nervous driving in the winter because she went off the road last year in her AWD vehicle (From people I have talked to, this is just something that happens to a good portion of people out here) and I explain to her that it isn't too bad. I recommend to her that we replace her vehicle with something 4WD and learn to use it, but half of the people she knows swear by AWD, the other half tell her 4WD, clearance and knowing when to use the 4WD is better.. so pluses and minuses?

906,North Dakota,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, dark, love","North Dakota, extreme cold, and Electric Vehicles","I've probably asked this a couple times here and there, but with renewed talk of the federal government wanting to force electric vehicles on people, it seems relevant.  

How would today's modern EV's fare in North Dakota's cold winters?  What happens if one sits outside in sub zero degree temperatures for 8 hours while someone is at work or sits outside for a week?  (Not everyone has an insulated garage.)  Can you start one up at -10 degrees F without inflicting any damage on the batteries or the vehicle?  How will the cold affect the lifespan of the expensive batteries?  Will they lose their ability to provide range over time?

[EPA reportedly planning to announce significant limits on tailpipe emissions to boost electric vehicle adoption](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/08/epa-reportedly-planning-to-announce-significant-limits-on-tailpipe-emissions.html)

Not all of the vehicles will have to be electric, so maybe it would make sense for North Dakota to be an outlier with a higher proportion of gas vehicles.

**EDIT**  Thanks for everyone's responses.  For clarification I'm not anti-EV; I'd love to have one.  I'm just worried about the practical issues that could affect their longevity in this climate.  (I may be making a new vehicle purchase in the next few years, and EV vs. ICE could become an issue.)  Some additional questions that have occurred to me:

* What is the long term effect on the batteries after they've dealt with sitting out at -10 deg F year after year?  Can we expect expensive battery replacement costs after several years?

* Will we see special cold weather versions that come with battery heaters?",2023-04-15 08:21:32

Been trying to do some research on life in the state, and everything is very biased to it being cold, boring, and lonely. Looking for some honest opinions the boredom and loneliness. I’m from MI, so while I haven’t been subjected to the subzero temperatures as you all are annually, I know I can get past the cold. Or at least embrace the suck. 
For reference, in MI, not a large social life. Spend most of my time golfing, also enjoy hunting and fishing, camping. I appreciate any and all responses.",2023-07-27 21:34:21
