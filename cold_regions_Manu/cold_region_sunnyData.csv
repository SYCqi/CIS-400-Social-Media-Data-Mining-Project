1,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
2,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

3,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, love",Just paid a visit to your state and I'm wearing shorts,"Anchorage was what I pictured ""typical"" Alaska to be in summertime -- cool weather, need jacket and hoodie.

Then I went to Fairbanks and wow it's like 86 out here and I have to wear shorts!  As a Texan this shocked me.

I didnt have enough time to visit the far north.

At any rate, I absolutely love your state.  Alaska truly is the last frontier and it's beauty was far greater than I anticipated.  My closest experience to you guys was Colorado but I have to say that Alaska blows Colorado out of the water.  Dont take your state for granted guys, there is stunning beauty everywhere you look that makes all the other states very jealous!

4,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, love",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50
5,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, love",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

6,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, love","Moving up in August, y'all are freaking me out (please reassure)","Hi folks! 

My husband and I accepted great jobs in the Anchorage area and are moving up in August. 

I've been really excited about it, but now that we're getting close, we have had so many friends/family be super negative about it and then I also keep seeing posts here about how miserable and awful it is and I'm freaking out a bit. 

I know that it's dark/cold right now and has been for a few months and that the negativity is condensed because no one comes on the internet to say how okay and normal everything is going. 

Info about our situation:

-We've been up twice, late October and late November and loved the beauty and nature even though it was damp and we liked the friendly but kinda gritty/crusty/real vibe of the people we met. 

-The pay is great. We will have more than enough to cover the increased cost of living, rapidly pay off student loans, save up for a house, go on a sunny vacation or two in the winter and most importantly - leave if we hate it. 

-We are outdoorsy homebodies that like hiking, fishing and camping and recently picked up snowshoeing for a winter sport. We've lived all over the country, have snow driving experience, and the other jobs we were considering were actually way, way more rural even though they were in the lower 48. 

-Kinda freaked out by bears, earthquakes and avalanches but I'm sure we'll get over it.

Anyways, thank you for reading my crazy rambling and please tell me it will all be okay :)",2023-03-08 04:26:24
7,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, love",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

8,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, love",I took a seasonal job in Seward this summer.,"I will be starting seasonal work in Seward this summer. I am beyond excited. I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).

9,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, love",Becoming a Bush Pilot ,"Hey y'all, my name is Spencer and for a long time I've had this need to go and live in Alaska, I'm a welder and have other limited experiences with car work, plumbing, outdoors skills, hunting, fishing, and kayaking. I have been doing as much research as I can online about what would be the best path for me to take to become a Bush Pilot in God's country. Should I do my flight school here in Central VA or move to Anchorage or Fairbanks, get a welding job and take flight school there since I'll be more adjusted to the weather Alaska will have to offer during my training? I want to be apart of this community, it can sound campy and probably just spew from someone who's young and dumb (I'm 25 as of posting this) but the allure of being someone that can take hunters, researchers, hikers, campers, and guides out to difficult spots and to assist in bringing supplies to communities, helping others out, being apart of something great is constantly drumming at my soul. I am at a stage of analysis paralysis and there's contradictory information out there on which is the best path. I don't want to take a lazy route, I want to earn this and be great to myself and others, I just want to know the best way to go about it. 

Thank you for y'alls time and I hope I got the wording of this out. If it helps any extra on where I'd like to make a more permanent living, the south east to south central parts of the state is what's attractive to me as a place for home but that can change once in the motion and falling in love with another spot.

12,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

14,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, love",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

I am planning an Alaska Cruise for my parents. I've booked a Cruise and Land Tour via Princess on the Sapphire from July 20 - Aug 1, 2024. I would love to hear people's thoughts on the comments, excursions picked, and if they would swap it out for any other experiences. My parent's do not have any mobility issues, but are also in their 70s and not the most active. They could do a few miles hiking, but would nothing too adventurous and wouldn't want my Mom on uneven terrain for too long.  Also, my Mom is vegetarian.

1. Ketchikan - July 22 - 6:00 AM - 2:00 PM
   1. Saxman Native Village, Dance Performance & Totem Park via Princess
   2. Spend remaining time exploring the town and lunch (Annabelle's vs Alaska Fish House)
   3. NOTE: I would love for them to do an easy hike that would allow them to see some scenery and possibly wildlife. In an ideal world, they would do some Bear viewing tour, but those are all 400-1000 bucks, which is out of budget for this port.
   4. NOTE #2: I offered for them to do the Misty Fjords Seaplane, and because they're doing the helicopter tour and a boat tour later on, decided against it. I could persuade them if people felt strongly about it.
2. Juneau - July 23, - 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM
   1. Harv and Marv's Whale Watching Tour - 10:30 AM - 2:30 PM
   2. Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Park + Nugget Fall's
   3. Rest of time exploring Juneau with Dinner at Tracy's?
   4. NOTE: I offered doing Whale Watching + Helicopter here - but they didn't want to pack the day with too many things since it's a long trip.
3. Skagway - July 24 - 7:00 AM - 8:30 PM
   1. TEMSCO Glacier Helicopter Tour - one benefit of this is that if it gets canceled due to weather, they could be rescheduled for the Denali Helicopter Tour later on
   2. Some other activity? - Klondike Summit/Suspension Bridge?
4. Mt. McKinley Wilderness Lodge (nearest excursion site is Talkeetna?) - July 27 afternoon through July 29 morning
   1. Mahay's Riverboat Devil's Canyon Adventure
   2. NOTE: I offered doing Talkeetna Air Taxi's flightseeing tour - but I think they want a Helicopter.
   3. Not sure what else can really do here
5. Denali Princess Wilderness Lodge - July 29 afternoon - July 31 AM
   1. Included Denali Natural History Tour - Upgrade to Tundra Wilderness vs Kantishna
   2. Not sure if there's something to fit in July 29 afternoon

I have never been to Alaska and I have been on the mid atlantic since forever. What are your remmendations for things to do around this time of year?

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

22,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, love",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

Since we met there, we thought it would be sweet.
 
I've always been an avid xcountry skier, and she's good at both, but neither of us have ever done an overnight winter backcountry trip. We do have lots of experience in cold weather though ( lived in fbx) and we love to backpack. 

Through reccomendationa from friends, we decided to celebrate by doing a part of ressurection pass: the north entrance to Caribou Creek Cabin ( 7 -8 miles). 

I haven't seen much info on doing this part in the winter. 

Anyone have any experience with this trail? Are we being stupid going this time of year?

24,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, love",Sightseeing late September (extending work trip),"First of all, I completely understand that the last week of September means potentially rainy weather, closures, and a limit on some of the typical Alaskan experiences tourists like myself might experience in the summer months. That said, I’m in anchorage for work, the dates are set, and I plan to extend the visit with my wife (both early thirties). 

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time. 

Appreciate any guidance this group can provide. Have visited Alaska before, love it, and can’t wait to be back with my wife.",2023-08-13 20:54:47

26,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, love",Seeking advice on Kenai Fjords boat tour in bad weather,"Hiya locals and thank you for having me - it took me way too long to get here but your lovely state is the last one I needed to check off on my visit to all 50! Huzzah!

I have an all day Kenai Fjords boat tour booked on one of the very small boats. The marine forecast has turned and we may not be able to get to Aialik Bay. My question is- do you think the benefits of a small boat tour make it worth it to keep this booking and possibly stay in Resurrection Bay? Or should I go with a larger boat that is not quite so weather dependent? I'm in it more for the wildlife possibilities, especially since the fog might make scenery visibility nil. 
But as you all know, the small boat tours are $$$ compared to the big boys and this was one of the biggest splurges of our trip. 

Thanks for the help!!",2023-08-06 18:45:43

What better way to remember a loved one but with art!?

Cut down the tree two years ago, took a moisture reading and it said it was 17%, so being that these stumps last FOREVER in nature as is, I figure if I create a base that sheds water, and use a weather proof oil or some stain (any recommended materials for this particular piece would be appreciated!)",2023-07-23 16:23:19
29,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, love",Questions in advance of trip,"I’m currently planning a two-week trip to Alaska with my girlfriend (August 8-21). At the moment, specific timing is mostly up in the air, but we’re 100% planning on Denali, Seward, and some day trips near Anchorage. While the flair is mostly tongue-in-cheek - I always try to do my own research before asking questions on Reddit - I still have a few questions either based on what I’ve read or that I couldn’t find online:

* I was seeing a lot of recommendations to book things in advance, but I want to be flexible in case of inclement weather (plus, still figuring out the itinerary). That said, for a lot of the things I was looking at (flightseeing, Kenai Fjords, trains, various kayaking trips, etc.), there’s plenty of availability, even if I wanted to go tomorrow or next week. Is it still advisable to book things weeks in advance, or would a few days suffice at this point? Is there a bigger tourist spike in August?

* I’ll be doing the Skinny Raven Half on 8/20 and want to try to keep my training up. While I feel decent about running opportunities in Anchorage (within downtown or in parks), I wanted to see if there would be similar opportunities near Denali or Seward - I’m used to road running, but I can do paved or even trails. I figured that Seward would be easy enough to just run around downtown, but I’m a bit iffy on Denali - one idea I had was running up and down Parks Highway for a few miles, but if this is a moronic idea, I’d definitely like to know (and also understand what to expect in terms of wildlife). 

* On another note, based on what I saw from a previous post, bear spray is advisable for runs - I wanted to confirm that this is the case even in Anchorage and Seward. Already planning on no headphones, but open to other recommendations and advice from runners, since I’m so used to running in cities and city parks. 

* Finally, I’ve done some baseline research, but I’m always up for any suggestions for restaurants and breweries, anywhere between Denali and Seward - especially love unique local food and smaller neighborhood brewpubs whose products I would never find out of state. If any of you have places you want to shout out, would love to hear about it!

Thanks in advance - can’t wait to visit!",2023-07-22 16:23:23
30,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, hate","Moving up in August, y'all are freaking me out (please reassure)","Hi folks! 

My husband and I accepted great jobs in the Anchorage area and are moving up in August. 

I've been really excited about it, but now that we're getting close, we have had so many friends/family be super negative about it and then I also keep seeing posts here about how miserable and awful it is and I'm freaking out a bit. 

I know that it's dark/cold right now and has been for a few months and that the negativity is condensed because no one comes on the internet to say how okay and normal everything is going. 

Info about our situation:

-We've been up twice, late October and late November and loved the beauty and nature even though it was damp and we liked the friendly but kinda gritty/crusty/real vibe of the people we met. 

-The pay is great. We will have more than enough to cover the increased cost of living, rapidly pay off student loans, save up for a house, go on a sunny vacation or two in the winter and most importantly - leave if we hate it. 

-We are outdoorsy homebodies that like hiking, fishing and camping and recently picked up snowshoeing for a winter sport. We've lived all over the country, have snow driving experience, and the other jobs we were considering were actually way, way more rural even though they were in the lower 48. 

-Kinda freaked out by bears, earthquakes and avalanches but I'm sure we'll get over it.

Anyways, thank you for reading my crazy rambling and please tell me it will all be okay :)",2023-03-08 04:26:24
31,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, hate",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

33,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, hate",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
34,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
35,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, hate",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

36,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, hate",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice?

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
43,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

44,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, enjoy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
45,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, enjoy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
46,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, enjoy",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

52,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, enjoy",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

53,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, enjoy","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57
54,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, dislike",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
55,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, dislike",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

57,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

58,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, annoying",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
59,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, annoying",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips.

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
64,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, happy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
65,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, happy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
66,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, happy",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

As the title states, I’m wondering if folks have any idea of work that would allow me to travel the Aleutian Islands?

Long story short, I grew up in Alaska and have since moved away. The last year or so I have been feeling the urge to swim back upstream (sorry, couldn’t resist) but would like to explore someplace new.  

I’m definitely not into working in a cannery and I don’t know how I’d fair on a fishing boat but other than those two, if I get to be outside I’m into it.

Not that it’s directly applicable but I’ve been a wildland firefighter these last eight years so hard work and weather won’t scare me off. In fact, I think I’d be most happy camping and hiking heavy loads through the wilderness.

Thanks for any suggestions!",2023-03-24 06:11:20
70,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, annoyed",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

71,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, annoyed",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
72,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, annoyed",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Have a 2022 Ford Escape and more specifically the 4 cylinder AWD Hybrid model. Ford advertises that I should have around 1500 lb towing capacity and that a small teardrop trailer is fine to tow. I'm looking into getting the UHaul trailer hitch installed that has a 4500 lb capacity. There are two trailers from UHaul that I think I should be comfortable to tow. I'm waffling between the 4x8 and the 5x8 enclosed trailers they have to offer. The 4x8 already weighs around 850lbs and the 5x8 listed as 900lbs. So I was thinking to be safe and within 80% of my towing capacity it only gives me between 300 - 350 lbs depending on which model I were to choose. 

My biggest question for the group is whether or not the 4x8 or 5x8 would be reasonable on the Alaska Highway. It's not my first time driving it so I do remember the steep hills, which is a cause of my concern. If there was anyone with advice weather the 5x8 would be better off than the 4x8 or vice-a-versa it would be greatly appreciated. 

  
I have already looked into possibly pulling my car via their 10ft box trailer and it comes out closer to $3k which is less appealing.

79,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, love",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

80,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
81,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
82,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

I didnt have enough time to visit the far north.

At any rate, I absolutely love your state.  Alaska truly is the last frontier and it's beauty was far greater than I anticipated.  My closest experience to you guys was Colorado but I have to say that Alaska blows Colorado out of the water.

84,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, love",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50

I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

87,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, love",I took a seasonal job in Seward this summer.,"I will be starting seasonal work in Seward this summer. I am beyond excited. I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).

I have been doing as much research as I can online about what would be the best path for me to take to become a Bush Pilot in God's country. Should I do my flight school here in Central VA or move to Anchorage or Fairbanks, get a welding job and take flight school there since I'll be more adjusted to the weather Alaska will have to offer during my training? I want to be apart of this community, it can sound campy and probably just spew from someone who's young and dumb (I'm 25 as of posting this) but the allure of being someone that can take hunters, researchers, hikers, campers, and guides out to difficult spots and to assist in bringing supplies to communities, helping others out, being apart of something great is constantly drumming at my soul. I am at a stage of analysis paralysis and there's contradictory information out there on which is the best path. I don't want to take a lazy route, I want to earn this and be great to myself and others, I just want to know the best way to go about it. 

Thank you for y'alls time and I hope I got the wording of this out. If it helps any extra on where I'd like to make a more permanent living, the south east to south central parts of the state is what's attractive to me as a place for home but that can change once in the motion and falling in love with another spot.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

For reference, my work is visiting military bases across the country and talking with some folks. And isn’t much more than an hour per base visit. 

23rd - arrive in Fairbanks

24th - free day suggestions for anything goes

25th - I work until probably 2:30pm as I’ll be at Wainright/Eielson. Maybe a lunch/dinner spot/something chill like murphys dome for the aurora.

26th - going to Greely early AM, will be free from 11AM and on. Hot springs maybe? Something more.

27th - Then Clear Space Force in Anderson in the AM, then driving to anchorage. Would like to stop in Denali for a lil spot to eat before making it down.

28th or 29th - one of these days are free. I have to meet at Elmendorf in the AM on one.  I was looking to do one of the plane tours over a glacier or the Denali park. I know it’s $$ but seems worth it. Then I would love to make it Homer or Seward on the day I’m free. 

Then I go home the 30th. This is the way the trip has to be set up essentially. If you made it this far I appreciate you.

I would love to hear people's thoughts on the comments, excursions picked, and if they would swap it out for any other experiences. My parent's do not have any mobility issues, but are also in their 70s and not the most active. They could do a few miles hiking, but would nothing too adventurous and wouldn't want my Mom on uneven terrain for too long.  Also, my Mom is vegetarian.

1. Ketchikan - July 22 - 6:00 AM - 2:00 PM
   1. Saxman Native Village, Dance Performance & Totem Park via Princess
   2. Spend remaining time exploring the town and lunch (Annabelle's vs Alaska Fish House)
   3. NOTE: I would love for them to do an easy hike that would allow them to see some scenery and possibly wildlife. In an ideal world, they would do some Bear viewing tour, but those are all 400-1000 bucks, which is out of budget for this port.
   4. NOTE #2: I offered for them to do the Misty Fjords Seaplane, and because they're doing the helicopter tour and a boat tour later on, decided against it. I could persuade them if people felt strongly about it.
2. Juneau - July 23, - 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM
   1. Harv and Marv's Whale Watching Tour - 10:30 AM - 2:30 PM
   2. Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Park + Nugget Fall's
   3. Rest of time exploring Juneau with Dinner at Tracy's?
   4. NOTE: I offered doing Whale Watching + Helicopter here - but they didn't want to pack the day with too many things since it's a long trip.
3. Skagway - July 24 - 7:00 AM - 8:30 PM
   1. TEMSCO Glacier Helicopter Tour - one benefit of this is that if it gets canceled due to weather, they could be rescheduled for the Denali Helicopter Tour later on
   2. Some other activity? - Klondike Summit/Suspension Bridge?
4. Mt. McKinley Wilderness Lodge (nearest excursion site is Talkeetna?) - July 27 afternoon through July 29 morning
   1. Mahay's Riverboat Devil's Canyon Adventure
   2. NOTE: I offered doing Talkeetna Air Taxi's flightseeing tour - but I think they want a Helicopter.
   3. Not sure what else can really do here
5. Denali Princess Wilderness Lodge - July 29 afternoon - July 31 AM

101,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, love",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

102,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, love",Tips on ressurection pass trail?,"I've been living outside of Alaska for a year now ( I miss it ), but my partner and I are headed back up to Anchorage for our anniversary in end of November. Since we met there, we thought it would be sweet.
 
I've always been an avid xcountry skier, and she's good at both, but neither of us have ever done an overnight winter backcountry trip. We do have lots of experience in cold weather though ( lived in fbx) and we love to backpack. 

Through reccomendationa from friends, we decided to celebrate by doing a part of ressurection pass: the north entrance to Caribou Creek Cabin ( 7 -8 miles). 

I haven't seen much info on doing this part in the winter. 

Anyone have any experience with this trail? Are we being stupid going this time of year?

Also I'd love any tips in general for back country ski trips.",2023-11-07 21:36:59
103,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, love",Sightseeing late September (extending work trip),"First of all, I completely understand that the last week of September means potentially rainy weather, closures, and a limit on some of the typical Alaskan experiences tourists like myself might experience in the summer months. That said, I’m in anchorage for work, the dates are set, and I plan to extend the visit with my wife (both early thirties). 

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time. 

Appreciate any guidance this group can provide. Have visited Alaska before, love it, and can’t wait to be back with my wife.",2023-08-13 20:54:47

I have an all day Kenai Fjords boat tour booked on one of the very small boats. The marine forecast has turned and we may not be able to get to Aialik Bay. My question is- do you think the benefits of a small boat tour make it worth it to keep this booking and possibly stay in Resurrection Bay? Or should I go with a larger boat that is not quite so weather dependent? I'm in it more for the wildlife possibilities, especially since the fog might make scenery visibility nil. 
But as you all know, the small boat tours are $$$ compared to the big boys and this was one of the biggest splurges of our trip.

108,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, love",Questions in advance of trip,"I’m currently planning a two-week trip to Alaska with my girlfriend (August 8-21). At the moment, specific timing is mostly up in the air, but we’re 100% planning on Denali, Seward, and some day trips near Anchorage. While the flair is mostly tongue-in-cheek - I always try to do my own research before asking questions on Reddit - I still have a few questions either based on what I’ve read or that I couldn’t find online:

* I was seeing a lot of recommendations to book things in advance, but I want to be flexible in case of inclement weather (plus, still figuring out the itinerary). That said, for a lot of the things I was looking at (flightseeing, Kenai Fjords, trains, various kayaking trips, etc.), there’s plenty of availability, even if I wanted to go tomorrow or next week. Is it still advisable to book things weeks in advance, or would a few days suffice at this point? Is there a bigger tourist spike in August?

* I’ll be doing the Skinny Raven Half on 8/20 and want to try to keep my training up. While I feel decent about running opportunities in Anchorage (within downtown or in parks), I wanted to see if there would be similar opportunities near Denali or Seward - I’m used to road running, but I can do paved or even trails. I figured that Seward would be easy enough to just run around downtown, but I’m a bit iffy on Denali - one idea I had was running up and down Parks Highway for a few miles, but if this is a moronic idea, I’d definitely like to know (and also understand what to expect in terms of wildlife). 

* On another note, based on what I saw from a previous post, bear spray is advisable for runs - I wanted to confirm that this is the case even in Anchorage and Seward. Already planning on no headphones, but open to other recommendations and advice from runners, since I’m so used to running in cities and city parks. 

* Finally, I’ve done some baseline research, but I’m always up for any suggestions for restaurants and breweries, anywhere between Denali and Seward - especially love unique local food and smaller neighborhood brewpubs whose products I would never find out of state. If any of you have places you want to shout out, would love to hear about it!

Thanks in advance - can’t wait to visit!",2023-07-22 16:23:23
109,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, hate",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

110,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, hate",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

112,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, hate",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
113,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
114,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, hate",Advice for moving to and finding work in Alaska?,"I am in the early stages of looking into what it would take to move to and find work in Alaska, as I grew up in colder climates (not Alaska cold) and really hate being hot all the time. On top of the fact that the Alaskan lifestyle and beautiful landscapes are much nicer to photograph than the mojave desert. I much prefer being cold all the time. I've got a car, a passport, 3 cats, and two rooms worth of stuff. I could fit pretty much everything I care about except my fridge, desk, and dresser into my car. What would be the most affordable way to move that stuff?
Also, I have been looking at various job websites, but I'm wondering if anyone has a better strategy for this. I'm trying to find work, ideally in IT as I am A+ certified. But I currently work as a technical service writer/customer service/IT Manager at an RV repair shop for about 3 years.

115,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, hate","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
116,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, hate",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Sorry guys 

Me and my Fiancé are planning our honeymoon for a little cabin getaway and possibly see northern lights.
 So we are thinking Fairbanks is the place to go for a week around the end of October - start of November. I don't know much about Fairbanks as I've only visited the islands of Alaska.
 So what will the daylight hours be like in late fall? Snow level and temperature? 
We are hoping to stay outside of town in a cabin or something but it's hard to find ones just off google reviews. Pleasant Acre Ranch?

118,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, hate",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice?

124,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

125,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, enjoy",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
126,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, enjoy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
127,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, enjoy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
128,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, enjoy",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Sorry guys 

Me and my Fiancé are planning our honeymoon for a little cabin getaway and possibly see northern lights.
 So we are thinking Fairbanks is the place to go for a week around the end of October - start of November. I don't know much about Fairbanks as I've only visited the islands of Alaska.
 So what will the daylight hours be like in late fall? Snow level and temperature? 
We are hoping to stay outside of town in a cabin or something but it's hard to find ones just off google reviews. Pleasant Acre Ranch?

24th - free day suggestions for anything goes

25th - I work until probably 2:30pm as I’ll be at Wainright/Eielson. Maybe a lunch/dinner spot/something chill like murphys dome for the aurora.

26th - going to Greely early AM, will be free from 11AM and on. Hot springs maybe? Something more.

27th - Then Clear Space Force in Anderson in the AM, then driving to anchorage. Would like to stop in Denali for a lil spot to eat before making it down.

28th or 29th - one of these days are free. I have to meet at Elmendorf in the AM on one.  I was looking to do one of the plane tours over a glacier or the Denali park. I know it’s $$ but seems worth it. Then I would love to make it Homer or Seward on the day I’m free. 

Then I go home the 30th. This is the way the trip has to be set up essentially. If you made it this far I appreciate you. I would love to meet down to earth people in a new place the whole opposite side of the continent that’s beauty will give me an asthma attack, so if y’all are chill and can help show me around on my free time in either Fairbanks or Anchorage I’d buy you a beer on my per diem lmao. APPRECIATE YA

I do photography so any related suggestions there would be great.

136,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, enjoy",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

137,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, enjoy","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57
138,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, dislike",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

139,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, dislike",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
140,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, dislike","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
141,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, dislike",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

I do feel dumb for not noticing there was 2 separate pages, so from the bottom of my heart, my bad. I won't delete it though incase others like myself come upon it and read the few helpful responses :)
Sorry guys 

Me and my Fiancé are planning our honeymoon for a little cabin getaway and possibly see northern lights.
 So we are thinking Fairbanks is the place to go for a week around the end of October - start of November. I don't know much about Fairbanks as I've only visited the islands of Alaska.
 So what will the daylight hours be like in late fall? Snow level and temperature? 
We are hoping to stay outside of town in a cabin or something but it's hard to find ones just off google reviews. Pleasant Acre Ranch?
What are the nearby sights to see for an outdoorsy adventurous couple? ",2024-05-19 17:48:45

144,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

145,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, annoying",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
146,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, annoying","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
147,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, annoying",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

I do feel dumb for not noticing there was 2 separate pages, so from the bottom of my heart, my bad. I won't delete it though incase others like myself come upon it and read the few helpful responses :)
Sorry guys 

Me and my Fiancé are planning our honeymoon for a little cabin getaway and possibly see northern lights.
 So we are thinking Fairbanks is the place to go for a week around the end of October - start of November. I don't know much about Fairbanks as I've only visited the islands of Alaska.
 So what will the daylight hours be like in late fall? Snow level and temperature? 
We are hoping to stay outside of town in a cabin or something but it's hard to find ones just off google reviews. Pleasant Acre Ranch?
What are the nearby sights to see for an outdoorsy adventurous couple? ",2024-05-19 17:48:45

It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

151,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, happy",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50
152,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, happy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

153,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, happy",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
154,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, happy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
155,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, happy",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

 So we are thinking Fairbanks is the place to go for a week around the end of October - start of November. I don't know much about Fairbanks as I've only visited the islands of Alaska.
 So what will the daylight hours be like in late fall? Snow level and temperature?

I’m definitely not into working in a cannery and I don’t know how I’d fair on a fishing boat but other than those two, if I get to be outside I’m into it.

Not that it’s directly applicable but I’ve been a wildland firefighter these last eight years so hard work and weather won’t scare me off. In fact, I think I’d be most happy camping and hiking heavy loads through the wilderness.

I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

161,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, annoyed",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
162,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, annoyed","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
163,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, annoyed",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

I do feel dumb for not noticing there was 2 separate pages, so from the bottom of my heart, my bad. I won't delete it though incase others like myself come upon it and read the few helpful responses :)
Sorry guys 

Me and my Fiancé are planning our honeymoon for a little cabin getaway and possibly see northern lights.
 So we are thinking Fairbanks is the place to go for a week around the end of October - start of November. I don't know much about Fairbanks as I've only visited the islands of Alaska.
 So what will the daylight hours be like in late fall? Snow level and temperature? 
We are hoping to stay outside of town in a cabin or something but it's hard to find ones just off google reviews. Pleasant Acre Ranch?
What are the nearby sights to see for an outdoorsy adventurous couple? ",2024-05-19 17:48:45

167,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, comfortable",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

168,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, comfortable",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
169,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, comfortable","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
170,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, comfortable",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

I do feel dumb for not noticing there was 2 separate pages, so from the bottom of my heart, my bad. I won't delete it though incase others like myself come upon it and read the few helpful responses :)
Sorry guys 

Me and my Fiancé are planning our honeymoon for a little cabin getaway and possibly see northern lights.
 So we are thinking Fairbanks is the place to go for a week around the end of October - start of November. I don't know much about Fairbanks as I've only visited the islands of Alaska.
 So what will the daylight hours be like in late fall? Snow level and temperature? 
We are hoping to stay outside of town in a cabin or something but it's hard to find ones just off google reviews. Pleasant Acre Ranch?

172,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, comfortable",Which UHaul Trailer should I choose for the Alaska Highway?,"Driving the Alaska highway down to the lower 48 from AK this August. Have a 2022 Ford Escape and more specifically the 4 cylinder AWD Hybrid model. Ford advertises that I should have around 1500 lb towing capacity and that a small teardrop trailer is fine to tow. I'm looking into getting the UHaul trailer hitch installed that has a 4500 lb capacity. There are two trailers from UHaul that I think I should be comfortable to tow. I'm waffling between the 4x8 and the 5x8 enclosed trailers they have to offer. The 4x8 already weighs around 850lbs and the 5x8 listed as 900lbs. So I was thinking to be safe and within 80% of my towing capacity it only gives me between 300 - 350 lbs depending on which model I were to choose. 

My biggest question for the group is whether or not the 4x8 or 5x8 would be reasonable on the Alaska Highway. It's not my first time driving it so I do remember the steep hills, which is a cause of my concern. If there was anyone with advice weather the 5x8 would be better off than the 4x8 or vice-a-versa it would be greatly appreciated. 

  
I have already looked into possibly pulling my car via their 10ft box trailer and it comes out closer to $3k which is less appealing.

They'll be a couple hours outside of Anchorage, and they're doing the typical outdoorsy activities, a smaller hike, group team building we might expect to see for a teen summer trip. He's typically a sweatpants and t shirt kind of guy. 

they're staying in canvas tents except for one night where they get to ""sleep under the stars"" if they want to. I read he might need a 20 degree bag but I was considering a 32 and getting him a liner because he sleeps hot? So if he's too warm he could just go without the liner or shed other layers he'll have (ie take off the fleece, keep the hat and warm socks). 

Thank you for your suggestions. I struggle with there being too many choices and conflicting advice and kind of freeze with decisions in the overwhelm. We do need to be budget conscious, he's on scholarship we aren't ""just"" putting him on a plane to Alaska for a week lol, but I'm also not worried about whether we'll ever use the gear again, my 12 yo goes camping with scouts frequently so things will get used.

175,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, love",I took a seasonal job in Seward this summer.,"I will be starting seasonal work in Seward this summer. I am beyond excited. I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).

177,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life.

178,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, love",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area.

I've been camping most of my life and have been around most of the lower 48 camping, camped with many different people from many walks of life and tried to learn as much as I can from their mistakes so I can reduce my chance of having a dangerous run in with wildlife. Over the years I have become somewhat of a good camper and the person I would be traveling with is very well travelled. 

I have never heard of people saying you ""need"" to bring a gun to camp or backpack until I brought up going to Alaska, and honestly what everyone is saying makes a lot of sense. I know some people bring a gun maybe hiking the AT or going deep into the back country just based on preference, but from what I've heard it seems like it makes a lot of sense to bring one. 

I have always considered it for past trips but it just seemed like too much of a haste, and initially I figured driving through Canada with a firearm isn't even worth it but from what I've heard/seen (which is very little but regardless) I don't want to take my chances. 

I would love to hear some other people weigh in on this debate. I am very well aware that using a gun improperly is more dangerous than just not having one at all and that in the moment it can be incredibly hard to focus and shoot accurately at a charging animal or what have you. I would also bring an air horn & bear spray as initial steps before doing anything with a firearm.",2023-11-18 16:20:08
192,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, love",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50

195,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, love",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

201,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, love",A story of moving to Alaska,"For those thinking about moving to Alaska.  I got this years ago and I cleaned it up to post here. 

July 12: Moved to our new home in Alaska. It is so beautiful here. The mountains are so majestic. Can't hardly wait to see the snow covering them.

August 22:  Alaska is the most beautiful place on earth. The leaves are turning all colors with shades of red and orange. Went for a ride today through the beautiful mountains and saw two moose. They are truly magnificent. Hope it will snow soon. I love Alaska.

September 15: Moose season is almost over now. Cant imagine how anyone would want to kill such a beautiful creature. Hope it wil snow soon. I love Alaska.

October 28: It snowed last night. Woke up with everything blanketed in white. It looks like a postcard. We went outside and cleaned the snow off the steps and took turns shoveling the driveway. We had a snowball fight (I won), and when the snowplow came by, we had to shovel the driveway again. What a beautiful place. I think I'll live here for ever.

November 5th: More snow last night. Ilove it! The snow plow came by again. I love it here.

December 27: 20 below zero is not nearly as cold as most people think. Had the car towed into a garage to thaw out; must have had an old battery. Took a cab to work.

January 4: More of the white crap fell last night. I've got blisters on my hands from shoveling. I think the snow plow hides around the comer and waits until I'm done shoveling the driveway. Butthead!

Jan 22: More fricking snow. If lever get my hands on that SOB who drives that snow plow I will rip his testicles off. Dont know why they don't put more gravel on the fricken roads.

Feb 1: More white crap. Been inside for three days except for shoveling out of the driveway after that plow goes through every time. Can't go anywhere, car's stuck in a mountain of white crap. The weatherman says to expect another 10 inches of crap tonight. Do you know how many shovels full of snow that is?

Feb 16: The fricken weatherman was wrong. We got 34 inches of the white crap yesterday. At this rate it wont melt before summer. The snow plow got stuck today. The SOB came to the door to ask if he could borrow my snow shovel. After I told him I had broken six shovels already shoveling all the crap he piled into my driveway, I broke my last one over his fricken skull.

March: 2 Finally got out of the house today. Went to the store to get some food and on the way back a stupid fricken moose ran out in front of my car and I hit him. Did about $6,000.00 damage to the car. Those fricken beasts should be killed. Wish a hunter had killed them all last summer.

April 23: Took the car to the garage in town. You would not believe all the paint and window chipping from all the fricken gravel they put on the roads.

June 2: Moved toCalifornia. I cant imagine why anyone in their right mind would ever live in that God-forsaken state.of Alaska.",2023-11-04 00:27:24

203,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
204,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, love",Am I Crazy?,"Hello, y'all! I'm a Texan hoping to vacation up in Alaska at some point next year in 2025, when money hopefully won't be quite as tight, been saving up a while. It's something I've always wanted to do, most likely up in Fairbanks and/or Anchorage (since it's only about 350 miles apart anyway). Here's where things get a little funky, though not at all serious

The majority of my family believes I'm crazy for wanting to go visit Alaska in the winter, in fact my sister is the only one on my side. Not that I wouldn't also want to do it in the summer, because I absolutely would love to do that too some other time. But hear me out first at least, hear my reasoning:

I know very well it'll be absolutely even more than frigid cold outside, and likely even too cold for my my native Texan ass, but I do still believe I'd enjoy it in a bit of an odd way. It's Alaska, it's known for beautiful scenery/landscapes, wildlife, the night sky outside the city, and winters that make you question your sanity and safety. I feel like part of the experience would be to go through mentioned Alaskan winters as well, not just the summer activities. I want the authentic Alaskan experience, dammit! But what do I know, I'm not Alaskan. On the other hand, y'all are, so what do y'all think? Am I really crazy? Hope y'all had a great new year up there!",2024-01-02 05:45:35
205,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, love",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
206,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, love",Becoming a Bush Pilot ,"Hey y'all, my name is Spencer and for a long time I've had this need to go and live in Alaska, I'm a welder and have other limited experiences with car work, plumbing, outdoors skills, hunting, fishing, and kayaking. I have been doing as much research as I can online about what would be the best path for me to take to become a Bush Pilot in God's country. Should I do my flight school here in Central VA or move to Anchorage or Fairbanks, get a welding job and take flight school there since I'll be more adjusted to the weather Alaska will have to offer during my training? I want to be apart of this community, it can sound campy and probably just spew from someone who's young and dumb (I'm 25 as of posting this) but the allure of being someone that can take hunters, researchers, hikers, campers, and guides out to difficult spots and to assist in bringing supplies to communities, helping others out, being apart of something great is constantly drumming at my soul. I am at a stage of analysis paralysis and there's contradictory information out there on which is the best path. I don't want to take a lazy route, I want to earn this and be great to myself and others, I just want to know the best way to go about it. 

Thank you for y'alls time and I hope I got the wording of this out. If it helps any extra on where I'd like to make a more permanent living, the south east to south central parts of the state is what's attractive to me as a place for home but that can change once in the motion and falling in love with another spot.

For context, we're considering Alaska for these primary reasons: we love the outdoors, want to have a small homestead, and we want to be around a like minded community that enjoys the same lifestyle. Plus I'd love to work for a company that helps with rural electrification/renewable energy like AVEC or any of the other power coops.

We'd like to visit Anchorage during the ""worst"" time in Alaska for at least a week to see if we can handle the low temp/long nights. Is that like Dec-Jan? Are there any reasons that's a bad idea?

Ive heard cost of living is high and seen stuff like $10 gallons of milk or $45 two-packs of olive oil. Are the groceries just high across the board or could some of the cost be mitigated with lifestyle changes?

We'd like about 2 acres to have goats, chickens, etc. to help with food costs and be more self sufficient. Anybody have experience with that and if it actually helps? Are there other options for cheaper but healthy food?

Housing/acreage seemed surprisingly sparse. Call me silly, but I would have thought there would be more options available. Is the current market pretty standard or is it just a bad time to look. (Perhaps more listings in the summer?)

Any other info for the areas I mentioned that someone from the lower 48 should know before moving up? Any help is appreciated!",2023-02-01 05:21:25

209,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

213,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, love","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

I'm moving from the Dallas, TX area - so obviously, culture and environment shock. Originally I'm from a rural southern town though, so familiar with small town politics / community, having to hop in a car to go 15-20 minutes for groceries etc. I know that the winters are long and cold, and that summers are beautiful. I was in the Anchorage / Seward / Knik Glacier last summer, and it was obviously amazing in the summer. I know that glacier silt in the Mat-Su valley is a thing.

I have a young family of 5 (ages 5 thru 12), so I know getting plugged into a community quickly will be very important; but what are some other considerations for the area? Is Alaska, and this area, a good place to raise a family? We homeschool already, and generally have pretty conservative values, so is that a good fit for the area? Important question - Does Amazon ship there? :) 

From a 'being independent' perspective - what all would need to be purchased prior to moving to Alaska to be prepared for the environment: snow blower? Tire chains? We've all got decent cold weather gear from skiing, outdoor gear from family camping trips, firearms from years of hunting... but are there other major items you have to aquire to make it there?

227,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).

240,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, hate",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

244,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, hate","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

271,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, enjoy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24

275,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

276,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, enjoy",January move to Juneau,"We’ve gotta make the drive down to Juneau (coming from Palmer) and are curious if anyone has advice on whether to go through Haines or Skagway to catch the ferry. The pass into Skagway kinda gives me pause, as I’m unsure about winter conditions on some of those turns. We’d prefer to stop in Whitehorse and Skagway to visit our friends, but if the Haines route is better, we’ll go with that. Any words of wisdom are appreciated.

We’re taking an SUV equipped with 4WD and studded tires. No trailer. We’ve done the drive up from Haines and Skagway several times in the summer, but not in winter. We will obviously check weather conditions, drive during daylight hours, and take our time. Thanks everyone.

277,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, enjoy",Any information on these villages?,"*First of all* let me add a little disclaimer, my aunt and uncle were both born and raised in Fairbanks. When I visited them last July it was my first time in Alaska. I got to see a lot of places on my bucket list and I really enjoyed my time there.

While I do think Alaska is the most beautiful state in the whole country, during my visit I was more interested in the history and culture of the state.

I plan on returning next summer, but this time I want to focus on visiting as many Native villages as I can. I have a list of villages I’m considering.

Obviously I’m going to have narrow this list down to maybe 20 villages, but I just wanted to see if anyone has been to any of these and what your experiences were there.

P.S. I am fully aware that most of them are going to be fly-in only communities and that will be a large portion of my expenses. And I know that Alaska is a very expensive state in general.

278,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, enjoy",I took a seasonal job in Seward this summer.,"I will be starting seasonal work in Seward this summer. I am beyond excited. I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).


Thank you in advanced 💜",2024-03-08 04:51:16
279,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, enjoy",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

I'm a Texan hoping to vacation up in Alaska at some point next year in 2025, when money hopefully won't be quite as tight, been saving up a while. It's something I've always wanted to do, most likely up in Fairbanks and/or Anchorage (since it's only about 350 miles apart anyway). Here's where things get a little funky, though not at all serious

The majority of my family believes I'm crazy for wanting to go visit Alaska in the winter, in fact my sister is the only one on my side. Not that I wouldn't also want to do it in the summer, because I absolutely would love to do that too some other time. But hear me out first at least, hear my reasoning:

I know very well it'll be absolutely even more than frigid cold outside, and likely even too cold for my my native Texan ass, but I do still believe I'd enjoy it in a bit of an odd way. It's Alaska, it's known for beautiful scenery/landscapes, wildlife, the night sky outside the city, and winters that make you question your sanity and safety. I feel like part of the experience would be to go through mentioned Alaskan winters as well, not just the summer activities. I want the authentic Alaskan experience, dammit! But what do I know, I'm not Alaskan. On the other hand, y'all are, so what do y'all think? Am I really crazy? Hope y'all had a great new year up there!",2024-01-02 05:45:35
281,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, enjoy",Managing expectations about moving to Alaska,"Hello everyone! I looked through a bunch of posts about moving to Alaska, but I do still have some some questions to make sure it'd be the right choice for my family.

Specifically, we'd be looking at Anchorage, Kodiak, Juneau, Valdez, or maybe Bethel (less likely though.) I'd be working in the power industry, so not too worried about job prospects 

For context, we're considering Alaska for these primary reasons: we love the outdoors, want to have a small homestead, and we want to be around a like minded community that enjoys the same lifestyle. Plus I'd love to work for a company that helps with rural electrification/renewable energy like AVEC or any of the other power coops.

These are my thoughts/questions:

We'd like to visit Anchorage during the ""worst"" time in Alaska for at least a week to see if we can handle the low temp/long nights. Is that like Dec-Jan? Are there any reasons that's a bad idea?

Ive heard cost of living is high and seen stuff like $10 gallons of milk or $45 two-packs of olive oil. Are the groceries just high across the board or could some of the cost be mitigated with lifestyle changes?

We'd like about 2 acres to have goats, chickens, etc. to help with food costs and be more self sufficient. Anybody have experience with that and if it actually helps? Are there other options for cheaper but healthy food?

Housing/acreage seemed surprisingly sparse. Call me silly, but I would have thought there would be more options available. Is the current market pretty standard or is it just a bad time to look. (Perhaps more listings in the summer?)

Any other info for the areas I mentioned that someone from the lower 48 should know before moving up? Any help is appreciated!",2023-02-01 05:21:25

283,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, enjoy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
284,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, enjoy",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

**UPDATE JULY '24**

Loved it, going back in the winter. Place is a blast. Make friends in the community and it makes all the difference. Cannot wait.",2024-03-25 15:15:33
288,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, enjoy","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart.

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active?

- honey was a listed ingredient (but, it Honey wasn't the ""flavor"" name, or anything)
- came in a clear bag with a label slapped on

I’m curious if there are any day hiking tours or groups I could join. Don’t want to go meandering on long hikes alone. 

Will be in Anchorage, Denali, and Kenai. Please throw in any local recommendations on food/bars/attractions. 

I do photography so any related suggestions there would be great. Also, wondering about how easy it is to find fellow locals who’d be down to exploring or chilling, just curious as to the culture as well. Since, I am by myself it would be exciting to find likeminded people who enjoy outdoors and learn about Alaska with them.

UPDATE: something’s I have booked can still be canceled or changed for a fee, is it worth rescheduling my flight to 12th through 18th? (Will the weather, and overall opportunities be better?)",2023-09-02 11:57:30
307,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, enjoy",Planning a Week Long Trip in Alaska - Open to ALL suggestions!,"Hey guys! Not to be that annoying tourist trying to plan a trip but also totally being that guy.

My wife and I are looking to come to Alaska for a week in August after a legitimately brutal working year. We are kind of new to planning trips on our own and have done a lot of research into the dos/do nots in Alaska. That said, there really is a ton of information out there and it's becoming hard to try and choose absolute winners of activities that would also give us time to  ""smell the roses""/truly enjoy every spot we go to.

I'm more of a mountaineer than my wife but we're young (30 yo) and can handle physically arduous things barring 1v1 bear fights.

&#x200B;

1.) For a weeks trip, what are some absolute DO NOT MISS things that we should do? Alaska looks beautiful and it seems like we can't go wrong with anything

2.) Our general itinerary would be to fly to Anchorage, then drive to Denali, and then down to the Seward/Homer area. But it sounds like 1 week is not enough time to really do those places justice so we may have to end up cutting out Denali for the below reasons.

We are torn between Denali and the Kenai Peninsula. On one hand, everyone talks about Denali but we saw that there is a landslide that severely limits ground transportation in the area. We mulled over a flight tour but some have pointed out that this summer, rain and fog have made them 50/50 shots. Kenai sounds/looks amazing but compared to some of the bigger sites in Alaska, I haven't heard much about it.

3) I've always wanted to hike on a glacier and was curious as to recommendations on what would be a good one that doesn't take all day. I've heard good things about the Byron, Portage, and Matanuska glaciers that seem to be all a relatively short driving distance from Anchorage.

4) Are snow mobile/ATV tours worth it? They are heavily marketed on some sites.

For the rest of my days (because I've been to many places in BC and Vancouver many times), I was considering trying to visit Hyder, doing a mini roadtrip for one of the ways and utilizing a one-way flight (to a nearby BC airport, i.e. Smithers).

This is something I intended to/was hoping to do this past summer or fall, but the plan fell through.

310,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, enjoy",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

Hi r/Alaska, I moved to the states not too long ago and have been yearning to see the auroras in your huge state for many years. Now that I am not so far, I want to try and plan this out. I am using the UA Fairbanks forecast to help me plan, but it only goes out for 3 weeks (still amazing tech! But)

I am still getting used to the weather in my place, and my place is not nearly as cold as Alaska, so I want to plan my trip sometime in the late summer. It's just for a weekend, but I want to make it count and catch the auroras.

- Do you think this is realistic?
- is it more reasonable to plan a trip to Fairbanks, Juneau or Anchorage to see this? With my trip span I am lucky to cover even a quarter of one city.
- I assume during this time of the year the auroras are visible to the naked eye and can be captured with a regular smartphone. Would you agree?

This is a bit short notice in terms of planning from my side. But I really really hope this all pays off. It would mean so much if I saw them.

So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time.

What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over?

327,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, dislike",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24

It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

**UPDATE JULY '24**

Loved it, going back in the winter. Place is a blast. Make friends in the community and it makes all the difference. Cannot wait.",2024-03-25 15:15:33
333,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, dislike","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice?

Hi r/Alaska, I moved to the states not too long ago and have been yearning to see the auroras in your huge state for many years. Now that I am not so far, I want to try and plan this out. I am using the UA Fairbanks forecast to help me plan, but it only goes out for 3 weeks (still amazing tech! But)

I am still getting used to the weather in my place, and my place is not nearly as cold as Alaska, so I want to plan my trip sometime in the late summer. It's just for a weekend, but I want to make it count and catch the auroras.

- Do you think this is realistic?
- is it more reasonable to plan a trip to Fairbanks, Juneau or Anchorage to see this? With my trip span I am lucky to cover even a quarter of one city.
- I assume during this time of the year the auroras are visible to the naked eye and can be captured with a regular smartphone. Would you agree?

361,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

The pass into Skagway kinda gives me pause, as I’m unsure about winter conditions on some of those turns. We’d prefer to stop in Whitehorse and Skagway to visit our friends, but if the Haines route is better, we’ll go with that. Any words of wisdom are appreciated.

We’re taking an SUV equipped with 4WD and studded tires. No trailer. We’ve done the drive up from Haines and Skagway several times in the summer, but not in winter. We will obviously check weather conditions, drive during daylight hours, and take our time. Thanks everyone. 

PS if anyone cares to share, how are the conditions getting up to Glennallen?",2024-11-15 00:00:26
363,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, annoying",I took a seasonal job in Seward this summer.,"I will be starting seasonal work in Seward this summer. I am beyond excited. I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).


Thank you in advanced 💜",2024-03-08 04:51:16
364,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, annoying",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24

366,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, annoying",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

370,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, annoying","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart.

My wife and I are looking to come to Alaska for a week in August after a legitimately brutal working year. We are kind of new to planning trips on our own and have done a lot of research into the dos/do nots in Alaska. That said, there really is a ton of information out there and it's becoming hard to try and choose absolute winners of activities that would also give us time to  ""smell the roses""/truly enjoy every spot we go to.

I'm more of a mountaineer than my wife but we're young (30 yo) and can handle physically arduous things barring 1v1 bear fights.

1.) For a weeks trip, what are some absolute DO NOT MISS things that we should do? Alaska looks beautiful and it seems like we can't go wrong with anything

2.) Our general itinerary would be to fly to Anchorage, then drive to Denali, and then down to the Seward/Homer area. But it sounds like 1 week is not enough time to really do those places justice so we may have to end up cutting out Denali for the below reasons.

We are torn between Denali and the Kenai Peninsula. On one hand, everyone talks about Denali but we saw that there is a landslide that severely limits ground transportation in the area. We mulled over a flight tour but some have pointed out that this summer, rain and fog have made them 50/50 shots. Kenai sounds/looks amazing but compared to some of the bigger sites in Alaska, I haven't heard much about it.

3) I've always wanted to hike on a glacier and was curious as to recommendations on what would be a good one that doesn't take all day. I've heard good things about the Byron, Portage, and Matanuska glaciers that seem to be all a relatively short driving distance from Anchorage.

4) Are snow mobile/ATV tours worth it? They are heavily marketed on some sites.

I am still getting used to the weather in my place, and my place is not nearly as cold as Alaska, so I want to plan my trip sometime in the late summer. It's just for a weekend, but I want to make it count and catch the auroras.

- Do you think this is realistic?
- is it more reasonable to plan a trip to Fairbanks, Juneau or Anchorage to see this? With my trip span I am lucky to cover even a quarter of one city.
- I assume during this time of the year the auroras are visible to the naked eye and can be captured with a regular smartphone. Would you agree?

This is a bit short notice in terms of planning from my side. But I really really hope this all pays off. It would mean so much if I saw them.

I also wonder whether it might be worth adding some info on this into your wonderful wiki. I see a link to this in the sidebar though.",2023-07-21 18:18:46

390,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, annoying",Sightseeing late September (extending work trip),"First of all, I completely understand that the last week of September means potentially rainy weather, closures, and a limit on some of the typical Alaskan experiences tourists like myself might experience in the summer months. That said, I’m in anchorage for work, the dates are set, and I plan to extend the visit with my wife (both early thirties). 

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time. 

Appreciate any guidance this group can provide. Have visited Alaska before, love it, and can’t wait to be back with my wife.",2023-08-13 20:54:47

393,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, annoying",Deciding between visiting in June vs August-September,"Hi all, We've always visited during the last week of August to September. This is my favorite time of year anywhere in the world, honestly- the end of summer, beginning of fall leaves, Northern Lightsend of tourist season, Alaska State Fair, Labor Day Weekend. I'm leaning towards doing this again.

But thought I'd consider June. Advantages of June are that we've never seen the fireweed before, Bette weather, and Trygg Air says that June carries the best chance of seeing the walrus (though no guarantees). Disadvantages are much busier (right?) more expensive.

398,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, happy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24

400,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, happy",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

We’d prefer to stop in Whitehorse and Skagway to visit our friends, but if the Haines route is better, we’ll go with that. Any words of wisdom are appreciated.

We’re taking an SUV equipped with 4WD and studded tires. No trailer. We’ve done the drive up from Haines and Skagway several times in the summer, but not in winter. We will obviously check weather conditions, drive during daylight hours, and take our time. Thanks everyone.

403,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, happy",I took a seasonal job in Seward this summer.,"I will be starting seasonal work in Seward this summer. I am beyond excited. I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).

405,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, happy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

407,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, happy",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

**UPDATE JULY '24**

Loved it, going back in the winter. Place is a blast. Make friends in the community and it makes all the difference. Cannot wait.",2024-03-25 15:15:33
411,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, happy","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice?

I was in the Anchorage / Seward / Knik Glacier last summer, and it was obviously amazing in the summer. I know that glacier silt in the Mat-Su valley is a thing.

I have a young family of 5 (ages 5 thru 12), so I know getting plugged into a community quickly will be very important; but what are some other considerations for the area? Is Alaska, and this area, a good place to raise a family? We homeschool already, and generally have pretty conservative values, so is that a good fit for the area? Important question - Does Amazon ship there? :) 

From a 'being independent' perspective - what all would need to be purchased prior to moving to Alaska to be prepared for the environment: snow blower? Tire chains? We've all got decent cold weather gear from skiing, outdoor gear from family camping trips, firearms from years of hunting... but are there other major items you have to aquire to make it there?

I'm 25 and currently live in Arizona and am desperate to get out. I've got a good amount of experience in management/customer service and IT. Never went to college either. I was interested in Alaska as I love the outdoors and saw the potential of working there as a bit of an escape. I also like the idea of being able to save up some money a bit better than how I am now.

I'm not expecting anything life changing, but just want to experience life more. As for questions I have:

1. I'd probably be interested in working around Denali or other parks, within a lodge would be ideal. What have been your experiences with that if you know?


2. How does housing and transport work? I've found through research that some places do offer basic housing which would be more than enough for me, I'm a simple guy.

I probably have more which I may add on later, but these are my main concerns. I'd like to save up some money to fund a move from AZ to MN, so that is also something I am thinking about.

451,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, annoyed",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

453,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, annoyed",I took a seasonal job in Seward this summer.,"I will be starting seasonal work in Seward this summer. I am beyond excited. I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).

454,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, annoyed",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24

456,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, annoyed",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person.

----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

460,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, annoyed","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart.

As some of you know, my honey and I are headed up next week for a 2-week vacation.  And I understand that Alaska is huge beyond my comprehension.  I was going to bring clothes for the 40-60 temperatures.  

I just looked at weather for today through next Friday and it looks like it will be warmer than I expected.  Some places were showing mid 70s to a possible 80.  And no one was below 50 except for Deadhorse lows at night.  It was forecasting 60-70 has highs for the upcoming week.

We are going to be visiting Seward, Palmer, Talkeetna, Fairbanks, Deadhorse, Valdez.

Can some of you chip in your advice please?

My wife and I are looking to come to Alaska for a week in August after a legitimately brutal working year. We are kind of new to planning trips on our own and have done a lot of research into the dos/do nots in Alaska. That said, there really is a ton of information out there and it's becoming hard to try and choose absolute winners of activities that would also give us time to  ""smell the roses""/truly enjoy every spot we go to.

I'm more of a mountaineer than my wife but we're young (30 yo) and can handle physically arduous things barring 1v1 bear fights.

&#x200B;

1.) For a weeks trip, what are some absolute DO NOT MISS things that we should do? Alaska looks beautiful and it seems like we can't go wrong with anything

2.) Our general itinerary would be to fly to Anchorage, then drive to Denali, and then down to the Seward/Homer area. But it sounds like 1 week is not enough time to really do those places justice so we may have to end up cutting out Denali for the below reasons.

We are torn between Denali and the Kenai Peninsula. On one hand, everyone talks about Denali but we saw that there is a landslide that severely limits ground transportation in the area. We mulled over a flight tour but some have pointed out that this summer, rain and fog have made them 50/50 shots. Kenai sounds/looks amazing but compared to some of the bigger sites in Alaska, I haven't heard much about it.

3) I've always wanted to hike on a glacier and was curious as to recommendations on what would be a good one that doesn't take all day. I've heard good things about the Byron, Portage, and Matanuska glaciers that seem to be all a relatively short driving distance from Anchorage.

4) Are snow mobile/ATV tours worth it? They are heavily marketed on some sites.

Hi r/Alaska, I moved to the states not too long ago and have been yearning to see the auroras in your huge state for many years. Now that I am not so far, I want to try and plan this out. I am using the UA Fairbanks forecast to help me plan, but it only goes out for 3 weeks (still amazing tech! But)

I am still getting used to the weather in my place, and my place is not nearly as cold as Alaska, so I want to plan my trip sometime in the late summer. It's just for a weekend, but I want to make it count and catch the auroras.

- Do you think this is realistic?
- is it more reasonable to plan a trip to Fairbanks, Juneau or Anchorage to see this? With my trip span I am lucky to cover even a quarter of one city.
- I assume during this time of the year the auroras are visible to the naked eye and can be captured with a regular smartphone. Would you agree?

This is a bit short notice in terms of planning from my side. But I really really hope this all pays off. It would mean so much if I saw them.

What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over?

493,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, comfortable",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24

495,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, comfortable",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

**UPDATE JULY '24**

Loved it, going back in the winter. Place is a blast. Make friends in the community and it makes all the difference. Cannot wait.",2024-03-25 15:15:33
499,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, comfortable","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

500,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, comfortable",Katmai air charter reliability,"Hi,
I'm planning to visit King salmon and the katmai national park. I wanted to know how reliable Katmai Air services are. My trip is at the end of July. The flight from King salmon to ANC is supposed to reach ANC at 3:20. It seems like this is a service they're gonna start this summer, so there's no previous flight information online. The flight I need to be on leaves ANC at 4:40.
Do you think this might work, or is it quite likely that there will be weather related delays on the small flight given the season?",2024-06-09 07:15:23

Have a 2022 Ford Escape and more specifically the 4 cylinder AWD Hybrid model. Ford advertises that I should have around 1500 lb towing capacity and that a small teardrop trailer is fine to tow. I'm looking into getting the UHaul trailer hitch installed that has a 4500 lb capacity. There are two trailers from UHaul that I think I should be comfortable to tow. I'm waffling between the 4x8 and the 5x8 enclosed trailers they have to offer. The 4x8 already weighs around 850lbs and the 5x8 listed as 900lbs. So I was thinking to be safe and within 80% of my towing capacity it only gives me between 300 - 350 lbs depending on which model I were to choose. 

My biggest question for the group is whether or not the 4x8 or 5x8 would be reasonable on the Alaska Highway. It's not my first time driving it so I do remember the steep hills, which is a cause of my concern. If there was anyone with advice weather the 5x8 would be better off than the 4x8 or vice-a-versa it would be greatly appreciated. 

  
I have already looked into possibly pulling my car via their 10ft box trailer and it comes out closer to $3k which is less appealing.

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice?

I was in the Anchorage / Seward / Knik Glacier last summer, and it was obviously amazing in the summer. I know that glacier silt in the Mat-Su valley is a thing.

I have a young family of 5 (ages 5 thru 12), so I know getting plugged into a community quickly will be very important; but what are some other considerations for the area? Is Alaska, and this area, a good place to raise a family? We homeschool already, and generally have pretty conservative values, so is that a good fit for the area? Important question - Does Amazon ship there? :) 

From a 'being independent' perspective - what all would need to be purchased prior to moving to Alaska to be prepared for the environment: snow blower? Tire chains? We've all got decent cold weather gear from skiing, outdoor gear from family camping trips, firearms from years of hunting... but are there other major items you have to aquire to make it there?

Hi r/Alaska, I moved to the states not too long ago and have been yearning to see the auroras in your huge state for many years. Now that I am not so far, I want to try and plan this out. I am using the UA Fairbanks forecast to help me plan, but it only goes out for 3 weeks (still amazing tech! But)

I am still getting used to the weather in my place, and my place is not nearly as cold as Alaska, so I want to plan my trip sometime in the late summer. It's just for a weekend, but I want to make it count and catch the auroras.

- is it more reasonable to plan a trip to Fairbanks, Juneau or Anchorage to see this? With my trip span I am lucky to cover even a quarter of one city.
- I assume during this time of the year the auroras are visible to the naked eye and can be captured with a regular smartphone. Would you agree?

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

533,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, love",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

535,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, love",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

537,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, love",I took a seasonal job in Seward this summer.,"I will be starting seasonal work in Seward this summer. I am beyond excited. I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).

538,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
539,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, love",Becoming a Bush Pilot ,"Hey y'all, my name is Spencer and for a long time I've had this need to go and live in Alaska, I'm a welder and have other limited experiences with car work, plumbing, outdoors skills, hunting, fishing, and kayaking. I have been doing as much research as I can online about what would be the best path for me to take to become a Bush Pilot in God's country. Should I do my flight school here in Central VA or move to Anchorage or Fairbanks, get a welding job and take flight school there since I'll be more adjusted to the weather Alaska will have to offer during my training? I want to be apart of this community, it can sound campy and probably just spew from someone who's young and dumb (I'm 25 as of posting this) but the allure of being someone that can take hunters, researchers, hikers, campers, and guides out to difficult spots and to assist in bringing supplies to communities, helping others out, being apart of something great is constantly drumming at my soul. I am at a stage of analysis paralysis and there's contradictory information out there on which is the best path. I don't want to take a lazy route, I want to earn this and be great to myself and others, I just want to know the best way to go about it. 

Thank you for y'alls time and I hope I got the wording of this out. If it helps any extra on where I'd like to make a more permanent living, the south east to south central parts of the state is what's attractive to me as a place for home but that can change once in the motion and falling in love with another spot. 

Again thank you all for your time!",2024-04-28 20:59:03

I just got a gig bartending up in Healy for the Summer season and I don't really know what to expect. I'm excited but I don't know anyone who has done anything like this. Living in California currently. I'll be arriving in Anchorage a few days early and doing some shopping at Costco, and some other stores if you guys have any recommendations.

**Anything I should buy here specifically before I leave?**

**What should I bring that I probably am not thinking about?**

**Is it ever shorts/ flipflop weather up there?**

542,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

543,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

545,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, love",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

551,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, love",Cost to Live in Alaska,"Hey y'all. Kids and I are moving to Alaska this spring after the house sales. I've always wanted to move there since I was a kid reading Balto, Julie of the Wolves, Hatchet, My Side of the Mountain, and Island of the Blue Dolphins (know some aren't about Alaska but it's always reminded me of it for some reason).  The kids want to move also so we are all on board.

We've been redoing the house with lots of sweat equity so it sells better/for more. Getting the trucks (all 4wd)  rock solid and replacing everything on them. We've been downsizing and focusing on keeping tools and other needs vs stuff/wants/furniture. Ive homeschooled all the kids so lots of stuff. Researching by watching every YouTube homestead/fish/hunt/family video I can find, asking questions, taking notes and even watching Alaskan Costco and Grocery Hauls to see how the cost of groceries compare.

We are gardeners/farmers/homesteaders and the kids are 15-24 yrs old. Kids have grown up farming; garden, meat rabbits, pigs, dairy goats, chickens, ducks, quail, turkeys and we process our own meat as well as can; PC & WB, ferment, bake bread, make cheese, and dehydrate.

We don't like living here in TN at all. We moved here 4 years ago, after my husband passed away and I lost our farm in Ohio. I've a mortgage with a low interest rate on 3 acres here in TN.  We raise most all our food. We can afford living here but we are so unhappy and simply don't fit in here. 

 Kids can't afford to live on their own working full time    and  they want to find partners someday who work as hard as they do. I don't blame them as it's hard to find anyone with a good work ethic or people who are willing to work things out in a relationship based on what I've seen.. They were raised not to settle for red 
 flags and that relationships don't just happen...they're a give and take and no one should keep score. 

Lol, I know I sound like, ""I'm not like other girls."" right now. 

I work from home and that makes nearly all my income. The farm brings in the extra we need. I can continue working from home when we move to Alaska as long as I've internet. 

I know we will take a hit with the farm income/ animals since everyone gardens up there and there is a short season and we will not be set up the first year and will be starting over and just handling  infrastructure so to speak. We are canning up any extra veggies to  help counter that financial hit while we get established. We will be bringing some livestock babies with us; piglets, meat rabbits, Icelandics, and  quail. We are converting a trailer so they'll have housing when we get there we don't have to build and bringing our portable solar fencing with us for runs until we get a permanent space for them.

My oldest has a ""good job"" here working 12-14 hr days 6 days a week at $12 and he can just now afford an apartment and utilities on his own...as long as he was to eat ramen and doesn't meet someone. So he still lives at home and he is how we are affording to remodel the house.  I also grew up doing this so while no expert I was raised by parents who were/are and I can do enough diy to stay out of trouble.

We plan on building a small home/cabin on a few acres when we move up to Alaska. Our old farm was a tiny house on solar (but my husband who passed set it up so I'm not confident'going off grid' without a backup plan) and we had rainwater catchment as well as a spring fed pond for watering the animals. We also had a composting toilet. Ohio gets down to -10 but doesn't have the amount of snow AK does nor the constant negative temps. Ohio has a ton of humidity though and folks keep telling me Alaska is a dry snow so you don't get wet so I've my doubts about this information.  I keep thinking a freezer is dry inside but you'll still freeze to death locked in it even with your coveralls.

We also heated with wood. Bub and Sexy Beast of a Hubby cut it for us. Girls and I are not well versed on chopping wood but aren't afraid to learn. We did stack well though lol. I've also bought safety gear, a chainsaw light enough for me/the girls a big one for my moose of a son.  Figure a log splitter will equalize us in who can split wood.

I  read an article about evictions, folks not able to feed their family, cost of food has doubled and I'm having a slight panic attack and need your knowledge and experience. 

I put in our income in a cost of living and it said in order to maintain our current lifestyle (which is a very diy/self sufficient) we would need to earn an extra 35k a year!

How much are your utilities? What is the cost per kilowatt(?). How.much is water? How many in your family? How many cords per year for how many sq feet? How much is a cord of seasomed wood ( will need a years worth off the bat since wood we'd get would be wet). How much are groceries and how much of your own food do you grow/raise/harvest?

I want to connect to the grid and be on the road system cause I want to make sure we don't freeze to death or die in a snow drift and electric is not my most comfortable thing to work with plus winter means we'd still be running a generator so...maybe later once we're not building the property.
We do not have any friends here (being a widow tends to freak people out that it's contagious or they think yosomesomeu want their janky husband...heifer I had a King and this Queen doesn't settle for junk.) bit are working to build community.  We left Ohio mainly due to extended family that we have 0 contact with. 

Kids and I are on our own in every way and we are ok with that but they want healthy supportive partners  and we would love to  have friends that like bonfires, grilling out, see value in a stocked pantry, will trade you some time processing chickens or pigs for chickens or pork, don't only do things that require $ (like don't kids hike anymore? When did a date have to be an expensive restaurant? Picnics rock and it doesn't require going broke. And never hear....""Why don't you just buy meat from the grocery store?""

Am I being paranoid or is this a dream we need to put on hold longer, save up more (money from house selling is what/how we will buy land & materials up there)? I am a worrier and house goes up this spring. I get it could be cold feet but we are talking moving everything almost 5000 miles over 12 days.

I would love to hear people's thoughts on the comments, excursions picked, and if they would swap it out for any other experiences. My parent's do not have any mobility issues, but are also in their 70s and not the most active. They could do a few miles hiking, but would nothing too adventurous and wouldn't want my Mom on uneven terrain for too long.  Also, my Mom is vegetarian.

1. Ketchikan - July 22 - 6:00 AM - 2:00 PM
   1. Saxman Native Village, Dance Performance & Totem Park via Princess
   2. Spend remaining time exploring the town and lunch (Annabelle's vs Alaska Fish House)
   3. NOTE: I would love for them to do an easy hike that would allow them to see some scenery and possibly wildlife. In an ideal world, they would do some Bear viewing tour, but those are all 400-1000 bucks, which is out of budget for this port.
   4. NOTE #2: I offered for them to do the Misty Fjords Seaplane, and because they're doing the helicopter tour and a boat tour later on, decided against it. I could persuade them if people felt strongly about it.
2. Juneau - July 23, - 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM
   1. Harv and Marv's Whale Watching Tour - 10:30 AM - 2:30 PM
   2. Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Park + Nugget Fall's
   3. Rest of time exploring Juneau with Dinner at Tracy's?
   4. NOTE: I offered doing Whale Watching + Helicopter here - but they didn't want to pack the day with too many things since it's a long trip.
3. Skagway - July 24 - 7:00 AM - 8:30 PM
   1. TEMSCO Glacier Helicopter Tour - one benefit of this is that if it gets canceled due to weather, they could be rescheduled for the Denali Helicopter Tour later on
   2. Some other activity? - Klondike Summit/Suspension Bridge?
4. Mt. McKinley Wilderness Lodge (nearest excursion site is Talkeetna?) - July 27 afternoon through July 29 morning
   1. Mahay's Riverboat Devil's Canyon Adventure
   2. NOTE: I offered doing Talkeetna Air Taxi's flightseeing tour - but I think they want a Helicopter.
   3. Not sure what else can really do here
5. Denali Princess Wilderness Lodge - July 29 afternoon - July 31 AM
   1. Included Denali Natural History Tour - Upgrade to Tundra Wilderness vs Kantishna
   2. Not sure if there's something to fit in July 29 afternoon

558,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, love",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

Since we met there, we thought it would be sweet.
 
I've always been an avid xcountry skier, and she's good at both, but neither of us have ever done an overnight winter backcountry trip. We do have lots of experience in cold weather though ( lived in fbx) and we love to backpack. 

Through reccomendationa from friends, we decided to celebrate by doing a part of ressurection pass: the north entrance to Caribou Creek Cabin ( 7 -8 miles). 

I haven't seen much info on doing this part in the winter. 

Anyone have any experience with this trail? Are we being stupid going this time of year?

Also I'd love any tips in general for back country ski trips.",2023-11-07 21:36:59
560,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, love",Sightseeing late September (extending work trip),"First of all, I completely understand that the last week of September means potentially rainy weather, closures, and a limit on some of the typical Alaskan experiences tourists like myself might experience in the summer months. That said, I’m in anchorage for work, the dates are set, and I plan to extend the visit with my wife (both early thirties). 

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time. 

Appreciate any guidance this group can provide. Have visited Alaska before, love it, and can’t wait to be back with my wife.",2023-08-13 20:54:47

I have an all day Kenai Fjords boat tour booked on one of the very small boats. The marine forecast has turned and we may not be able to get to Aialik Bay. My question is- do you think the benefits of a small boat tour make it worth it to keep this booking and possibly stay in Resurrection Bay? Or should I go with a larger boat that is not quite so weather dependent? I'm in it more for the wildlife possibilities, especially since the fog might make scenery visibility nil. 
But as you all know, the small boat tours are $$$ compared to the big boys and this was one of the biggest splurges of our trip.

565,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, love",Questions in advance of trip,"I’m currently planning a two-week trip to Alaska with my girlfriend (August 8-21). At the moment, specific timing is mostly up in the air, but we’re 100% planning on Denali, Seward, and some day trips near Anchorage. While the flair is mostly tongue-in-cheek - I always try to do my own research before asking questions on Reddit - I still have a few questions either based on what I’ve read or that I couldn’t find online:

* I was seeing a lot of recommendations to book things in advance, but I want to be flexible in case of inclement weather (plus, still figuring out the itinerary). That said, for a lot of the things I was looking at (flightseeing, Kenai Fjords, trains, various kayaking trips, etc.), there’s plenty of availability, even if I wanted to go tomorrow or next week. Is it still advisable to book things weeks in advance, or would a few days suffice at this point? Is there a bigger tourist spike in August?

* I’ll be doing the Skinny Raven Half on 8/20 and want to try to keep my training up. While I feel decent about running opportunities in Anchorage (within downtown or in parks), I wanted to see if there would be similar opportunities near Denali or Seward - I’m used to road running, but I can do paved or even trails. I figured that Seward would be easy enough to just run around downtown, but I’m a bit iffy on Denali - one idea I had was running up and down Parks Highway for a few miles, but if this is a moronic idea, I’d definitely like to know (and also understand what to expect in terms of wildlife). 

* On another note, based on what I saw from a previous post, bear spray is advisable for runs - I wanted to confirm that this is the case even in Anchorage and Seward. Already planning on no headphones, but open to other recommendations and advice from runners, since I’m so used to running in cities and city parks. 

* Finally, I’ve done some baseline research, but I’m always up for any suggestions for restaurants and breweries, anywhere between Denali and Seward - especially love unique local food and smaller neighborhood brewpubs whose products I would never find out of state. If any of you have places you want to shout out, would love to hear about it!

567,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, hate",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

569,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice?

578,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

579,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, enjoy",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
580,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, enjoy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
581,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, enjoy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11

589,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, enjoy",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

590,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, enjoy","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

These are all northern cities with ocean and/or lake influences (or high altitude) but I needed air conditioning in all 4 of them. There were weeks on end of 85 degree+ weather with high humidity too.

Then, in summer 2017, I visited Anchorage for a week in summer and was just blown away by both the beauty and cool air. As the earth continues to warm it really is looking like Anchorage is one of the last cities to really escape the heat.",2023-07-26 23:46:12

594,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

598,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, happy",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50
599,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, happy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
600,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, happy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

As the title states, I’m wondering if folks have any idea of work that would allow me to travel the Aleutian Islands?

Long story short, I grew up in Alaska and have since moved away. The last year or so I have been feeling the urge to swim back upstream (sorry, couldn’t resist) but would like to explore someplace new.  

I’m definitely not into working in a cannery and I don’t know how I’d fair on a fishing boat but other than those two, if I get to be outside I’m into it.

Not that it’s directly applicable but I’ve been a wildland firefighter these last eight years so hard work and weather won’t scare me off. In fact, I think I’d be most happy camping and hiking heavy loads through the wilderness.

607,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, annoyed",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

611,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, comfortable",Which UHaul Trailer should I choose for the Alaska Highway?,"Driving the Alaska highway down to the lower 48 from AK this August. Have a 2022 Ford Escape and more specifically the 4 cylinder AWD Hybrid model. Ford advertises that I should have around 1500 lb towing capacity and that a small teardrop trailer is fine to tow. I'm looking into getting the UHaul trailer hitch installed that has a 4500 lb capacity. There are two trailers from UHaul that I think I should be comfortable to tow. I'm waffling between the 4x8 and the 5x8 enclosed trailers they have to offer. The 4x8 already weighs around 850lbs and the 5x8 listed as 900lbs. So I was thinking to be safe and within 80% of my towing capacity it only gives me between 300 - 350 lbs depending on which model I were to choose. 

My biggest question for the group is whether or not the 4x8 or 5x8 would be reasonable on the Alaska Highway. It's not my first time driving it so I do remember the steep hills, which is a cause of my concern. If there was anyone with advice weather the 5x8 would be better off than the 4x8 or vice-a-versa it would be greatly appreciated. 

  
I have already looked into possibly pulling my car via their 10ft box trailer and it comes out closer to $3k which is less appealing.

614,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, comfortable",Cost to Live in Alaska,"Hey y'all. Kids and I are moving to Alaska this spring after the house sales. I've always wanted to move there since I was a kid reading Balto, Julie of the Wolves, Hatchet, My Side of the Mountain, and Island of the Blue Dolphins (know some aren't about Alaska but it's always reminded me of it for some reason).  The kids want to move also so we are all on board.

We've been redoing the house with lots of sweat equity so it sells better/for more. Getting the trucks (all 4wd)  rock solid and replacing everything on them. We've been downsizing and focusing on keeping tools and other needs vs stuff/wants/furniture. Ive homeschooled all the kids so lots of stuff. Researching by watching every YouTube homestead/fish/hunt/family video I can find, asking questions, taking notes and even watching Alaskan Costco and Grocery Hauls to see how the cost of groceries compare.

We are gardeners/farmers/homesteaders and the kids are 15-24 yrs old. Kids have grown up farming; garden, meat rabbits, pigs, dairy goats, chickens, ducks, quail, turkeys and we process our own meat as well as can; PC & WB, ferment, bake bread, make cheese, and dehydrate.

We don't like living here in TN at all. We moved here 4 years ago, after my husband passed away and I lost our farm in Ohio. I've a mortgage with a low interest rate on 3 acres here in TN.  We raise most all our food. We can afford living here but we are so unhappy and simply don't fit in here. 

 Kids can't afford to live on their own working full time    and  they want to find partners someday who work as hard as they do. I don't blame them as it's hard to find anyone with a good work ethic or people who are willing to work things out in a relationship based on what I've seen.. They were raised not to settle for red 
 flags and that relationships don't just happen...they're a give and take and no one should keep score. 

Lol, I know I sound like, ""I'm not like other girls."" right now. 

I work from home and that makes nearly all my income. The farm brings in the extra we need. I can continue working from home when we move to Alaska as long as I've internet. 

I know we will take a hit with the farm income/ animals since everyone gardens up there and there is a short season and we will not be set up the first year and will be starting over and just handling  infrastructure so to speak. We are canning up any extra veggies to  help counter that financial hit while we get established. We will be bringing some livestock babies with us; piglets, meat rabbits, Icelandics, and  quail. We are converting a trailer so they'll have housing when we get there we don't have to build and bringing our portable solar fencing with us for runs until we get a permanent space for them.

My oldest has a ""good job"" here working 12-14 hr days 6 days a week at $12 and he can just now afford an apartment and utilities on his own...as long as he was to eat ramen and doesn't meet someone. So he still lives at home and he is how we are affording to remodel the house.  I also grew up doing this so while no expert I was raised by parents who were/are and I can do enough diy to stay out of trouble.

We plan on building a small home/cabin on a few acres when we move up to Alaska. Our old farm was a tiny house on solar (but my husband who passed set it up so I'm not confident'going off grid' without a backup plan) and we had rainwater catchment as well as a spring fed pond for watering the animals. We also had a composting toilet. Ohio gets down to -10 but doesn't have the amount of snow AK does nor the constant negative temps. Ohio has a ton of humidity though and folks keep telling me Alaska is a dry snow so you don't get wet so I've my doubts about this information.  I keep thinking a freezer is dry inside but you'll still freeze to death locked in it even with your coveralls.

We also heated with wood. Bub and Sexy Beast of a Hubby cut it for us. Girls and I are not well versed on chopping wood but aren't afraid to learn. We did stack well though lol. I've also bought safety gear, a chainsaw light enough for me/the girls a big one for my moose of a son.  Figure a log splitter will equalize us in who can split wood.

I  read an article about evictions, folks not able to feed their family, cost of food has doubled and I'm having a slight panic attack and need your knowledge and experience. 

I put in our income in a cost of living and it said in order to maintain our current lifestyle (which is a very diy/self sufficient) we would need to earn an extra 35k a year!

How much are your utilities? What is the cost per kilowatt(?). How.much is water? How many in your family? How many cords per year for how many sq feet? How much is a cord of seasomed wood ( will need a years worth off the bat since wood we'd get would be wet). How much are groceries and how much of your own food do you grow/raise/harvest?

I want to connect to the grid and be on the road system cause I want to make sure we don't freeze to death or die in a snow drift and electric is not my most comfortable thing to work with plus winter means we'd still be running a generator so...maybe later once we're not building the property.
We do not have any friends here (being a widow tends to freak people out that it's contagious or they think yosomesomeu want their janky husband...heifer I had a King and this Queen doesn't settle for junk.) bit are working to build community.  We left Ohio mainly due to extended family that we have 0 contact with. 

Kids and I are on our own in every way and we are ok with that but they want healthy supportive partners  and we would love to  have friends that like bonfires, grilling out, see value in a stocked pantry, will trade you some time processing chickens or pigs for chickens or pork, don't only do things that require $ (like don't kids hike anymore? When did a date have to be an expensive restaurant? Picnics rock and it doesn't require going broke. And never hear....""Why don't you just buy meat from the grocery store?""

Am I being paranoid or is this a dream we need to put on hold longer, save up more (money from house selling is what/how we will buy land & materials up there)? I am a worrier and house goes up this spring. I get it could be cold feet but we are talking moving everything almost 5000 miles over 12 days. 

Any helpful advice and constructive criticism would be most helpful and welcome.",2023-07-24 21:10:44

616,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

At any rate, I absolutely love your state.  Alaska truly is the last frontier and it's beauty was far greater than I anticipated.  My closest experience to you guys was Colorado but I have to say that Alaska blows Colorado out of the water.  Dont take your state for granted guys, there is stunning beauty everywhere you look that makes all the other states very jealous!

618,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, love",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50
619,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, love",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

620,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, love",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

621,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, love",I took a seasonal job in Seward this summer.,"I will be starting seasonal work in Seward this summer. I am beyond excited. I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).

622,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, love",Becoming a Bush Pilot ,"Hey y'all, my name is Spencer and for a long time I've had this need to go and live in Alaska, I'm a welder and have other limited experiences with car work, plumbing, outdoors skills, hunting, fishing, and kayaking. I have been doing as much research as I can online about what would be the best path for me to take to become a Bush Pilot in God's country. Should I do my flight school here in Central VA or move to Anchorage or Fairbanks, get a welding job and take flight school there since I'll be more adjusted to the weather Alaska will have to offer during my training? I want to be apart of this community, it can sound campy and probably just spew from someone who's young and dumb (I'm 25 as of posting this) but the allure of being someone that can take hunters, researchers, hikers, campers, and guides out to difficult spots and to assist in bringing supplies to communities, helping others out, being apart of something great is constantly drumming at my soul. I am at a stage of analysis paralysis and there's contradictory information out there on which is the best path. I don't want to take a lazy route, I want to earn this and be great to myself and others, I just want to know the best way to go about it. 

Thank you for y'alls time and I hope I got the wording of this out. If it helps any extra on where I'd like to make a more permanent living, the south east to south central parts of the state is what's attractive to me as a place for home but that can change once in the motion and falling in love with another spot.

625,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

626,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

628,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, love",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

I am planning an Alaska Cruise for my parents. I've booked a Cruise and Land Tour via Princess on the Sapphire from July 20 - Aug 1, 2024. I would love to hear people's thoughts on the comments, excursions picked, and if they would swap it out for any other experiences. My parent's do not have any mobility issues, but are also in their 70s and not the most active. They could do a few miles hiking, but would nothing too adventurous and wouldn't want my Mom on uneven terrain for too long.  Also, my Mom is vegetarian.

1. Ketchikan - July 22 - 6:00 AM - 2:00 PM
   1. Saxman Native Village, Dance Performance & Totem Park via Princess
   2. Spend remaining time exploring the town and lunch (Annabelle's vs Alaska Fish House)
   3. NOTE: I would love for them to do an easy hike that would allow them to see some scenery and possibly wildlife. In an ideal world, they would do some Bear viewing tour, but those are all 400-1000 bucks, which is out of budget for this port.
   4. NOTE #2: I offered for them to do the Misty Fjords Seaplane, and because they're doing the helicopter tour and a boat tour later on, decided against it. I could persuade them if people felt strongly about it.
2. Juneau - July 23, - 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM
   1. Harv and Marv's Whale Watching Tour - 10:30 AM - 2:30 PM
   2. Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Park + Nugget Fall's
   3. Rest of time exploring Juneau with Dinner at Tracy's?
   4. NOTE: I offered doing Whale Watching + Helicopter here - but they didn't want to pack the day with too many things since it's a long trip.
3. Skagway - July 24 - 7:00 AM - 8:30 PM
   1. TEMSCO Glacier Helicopter Tour - one benefit of this is that if it gets canceled due to weather, they could be rescheduled for the Denali Helicopter Tour later on
   2. Some other activity? - Klondike Summit/Suspension Bridge?
4. Mt. McKinley Wilderness Lodge (nearest excursion site is Talkeetna?) - July 27 afternoon through July 29 morning
   1. Mahay's Riverboat Devil's Canyon Adventure
   2. NOTE: I offered doing Talkeetna Air Taxi's flightseeing tour - but I think they want a Helicopter.
   3. Not sure what else can really do here
5. Denali Princess Wilderness Lodge - July 29 afternoon - July 31 AM
   1. Included Denali Natural History Tour - Upgrade to Tundra Wilderness vs Kantishna
   2. Not sure if there's something to fit in July 29 afternoon

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

635,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, love",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

That said, I’m in anchorage for work, the dates are set, and I plan to extend the visit with my wife (both early thirties). 

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time.

My question is- do you think the benefits of a small boat tour make it worth it to keep this booking and possibly stay in Resurrection Bay? Or should I go with a larger boat that is not quite so weather dependent? I'm in it more for the wildlife possibilities, especially since the fog might make scenery visibility nil.

642,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, love",Questions in advance of trip,"I’m currently planning a two-week trip to Alaska with my girlfriend (August 8-21). At the moment, specific timing is mostly up in the air, but we’re 100% planning on Denali, Seward, and some day trips near Anchorage. While the flair is mostly tongue-in-cheek - I always try to do my own research before asking questions on Reddit - I still have a few questions either based on what I’ve read or that I couldn’t find online:

* I was seeing a lot of recommendations to book things in advance, but I want to be flexible in case of inclement weather (plus, still figuring out the itinerary). That said, for a lot of the things I was looking at (flightseeing, Kenai Fjords, trains, various kayaking trips, etc.), there’s plenty of availability, even if I wanted to go tomorrow or next week. Is it still advisable to book things weeks in advance, or would a few days suffice at this point? Is there a bigger tourist spike in August?

* I’ll be doing the Skinny Raven Half on 8/20 and want to try to keep my training up. While I feel decent about running opportunities in Anchorage (within downtown or in parks), I wanted to see if there would be similar opportunities near Denali or Seward - I’m used to road running, but I can do paved or even trails. I figured that Seward would be easy enough to just run around downtown, but I’m a bit iffy on Denali - one idea I had was running up and down Parks Highway for a few miles, but if this is a moronic idea, I’d definitely like to know (and also understand what to expect in terms of wildlife). 

* On another note, based on what I saw from a previous post, bear spray is advisable for runs - I wanted to confirm that this is the case even in Anchorage and Seward. Already planning on no headphones, but open to other recommendations and advice from runners, since I’m so used to running in cities and city parks. 

* Finally, I’ve done some baseline research, but I’m always up for any suggestions for restaurants and breweries, anywhere between Denali and Seward - especially love unique local food and smaller neighborhood brewpubs whose products I would never find out of state. If any of you have places you want to shout out, would love to hear about it!

643,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, hate",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

645,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, hate",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
646,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
647,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, hate",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice? 

Thanks!  ",2024-02-28 18:41:22

(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**

654,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

656,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, enjoy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

I do photography so any related suggestions there would be great. Also, wondering about how easy it is to find fellow locals who’d be down to exploring or chilling, just curious as to the culture as well. Since, I am by myself it would be exciting to find likeminded people who enjoy outdoors and learn about Alaska with them.

662,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, enjoy",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

663,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, enjoy","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57
664,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, dislike",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
665,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, dislike",Hello!! I just visited last June and loved it !! It reminds me of Washington state alot.  ,THE 24 hour sunlight has to be the weirdest and coolest thing ever tho. Such a trip if you’re not from there !! I was in Fairbanks Alaska !!  I was on vacation visiting a friend ! ,2024-08-03 10:45:14
666,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

667,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, annoying",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

669,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, happy",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50

671,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, happy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
672,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, happy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

675,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, happy",Work in the Aleutian’s?,"Hello,

As the title states, I’m wondering if folks have any idea of work that would allow me to travel the Aleutian Islands?

Long story short, I grew up in Alaska and have since moved away. The last year or so I have been feeling the urge to swim back upstream (sorry, couldn’t resist) but would like to explore someplace new.  

I’m definitely not into working in a cannery and I don’t know how I’d fair on a fishing boat but other than those two, if I get to be outside I’m into it.

Not that it’s directly applicable but I’ve been a wildland firefighter these last eight years so hard work and weather won’t scare me off. In fact, I think I’d be most happy camping and hiking heavy loads through the wilderness.

Thanks for any suggestions!",2023-03-24 06:11:20
676,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, annoyed",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

677,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, annoyed",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
680,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, comfortable",Which UHaul Trailer should I choose for the Alaska Highway?,"Driving the Alaska highway down to the lower 48 from AK this August. Have a 2022 Ford Escape and more specifically the 4 cylinder AWD Hybrid model. Ford advertises that I should have around 1500 lb towing capacity and that a small teardrop trailer is fine to tow. I'm looking into getting the UHaul trailer hitch installed that has a 4500 lb capacity. There are two trailers from UHaul that I think I should be comfortable to tow. I'm waffling between the 4x8 and the 5x8 enclosed trailers they have to offer. The 4x8 already weighs around 850lbs and the 5x8 listed as 900lbs. So I was thinking to be safe and within 80% of my towing capacity it only gives me between 300 - 350 lbs depending on which model I were to choose. 

My biggest question for the group is whether or not the 4x8 or 5x8 would be reasonable on the Alaska Highway. It's not my first time driving it so I do remember the steep hills, which is a cause of my concern. If there was anyone with advice weather the 5x8 would be better off than the 4x8 or vice-a-versa it would be greatly appreciated. 

  
I have already looked into possibly pulling my car via their 10ft box trailer and it comes out closer to $3k which is less appealing.   


Thank you!",2024-05-30 02:45:06
681,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, comfortable",Hello!! I just visited last June and loved it !! It reminds me of Washington state alot.  ,THE 24 hour sunlight has to be the weirdest and coolest thing ever tho. Such a trip if you’re not from there !! I was in Fairbanks Alaska !!  I was on vacation visiting a friend ! ,2024-08-03 10:45:14
682,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clear sky, love",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50

(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

689,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, love",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

At any rate, I absolutely love your state.  Alaska truly is the last frontier and it's beauty was far greater than I anticipated.  My closest experience to you guys was Colorado but I have to say that Alaska blows Colorado out of the water.  Dont take your state for granted guys, there is stunning beauty everywhere you look that makes all the other states very jealous!

693,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, love",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50
694,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, love",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

695,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, love",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

696,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, love",I took a seasonal job in Seward this summer.,"I will be starting seasonal work in Seward this summer. I am beyond excited. I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).

I have been doing as much research as I can online about what would be the best path for me to take to become a Bush Pilot in God's country. Should I do my flight school here in Central VA or move to Anchorage or Fairbanks, get a welding job and take flight school there since I'll be more adjusted to the weather Alaska will have to offer during my training? I want to be apart of this community, it can sound campy and probably just spew from someone who's young and dumb (I'm 25 as of posting this) but the allure of being someone that can take hunters, researchers, hikers, campers, and guides out to difficult spots and to assist in bringing supplies to communities, helping others out, being apart of something great is constantly drumming at my soul. I am at a stage of analysis paralysis and there's contradictory information out there on which is the best path. I don't want to take a lazy route, I want to earn this and be great to myself and others, I just want to know the best way to go about it. 

Thank you for y'alls time and I hope I got the wording of this out. If it helps any extra on where I'd like to make a more permanent living, the south east to south central parts of the state is what's attractive to me as a place for home but that can change once in the motion and falling in love with another spot.

701,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

702,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

703,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, love",Cold Weather Clothing?,"As someone who lives where it barely ever freezes, and has the wardrobe to match that, what would you all suggest for warm weather clothes for someone who is planning on moving to Alaska?

As far articles of clothing, I mean things that might be often overlooked or things that might be better done a certain way?  Like, should I consider getting pants with the insulation sewn right into the pants?  Or should I wear those thermal underpants, with regular pants over them?

Having never really shopped for cold weather clothing, are there any brands that really stand out that I should preferentially consider?  I have a Carhartt jacket I've had for ages, it's a great work jacket, but it's never been tested in sub-zero temperatures, so I have no idea how it would fair.

I am planning an Alaska Cruise for my parents. I've booked a Cruise and Land Tour via Princess on the Sapphire from July 20 - Aug 1, 2024. I would love to hear people's thoughts on the comments, excursions picked, and if they would swap it out for any other experiences. My parent's do not have any mobility issues, but are also in their 70s and not the most active. They could do a few miles hiking, but would nothing too adventurous and wouldn't want my Mom on uneven terrain for too long.  Also, my Mom is vegetarian.

1. Ketchikan - July 22 - 6:00 AM - 2:00 PM
   1. Saxman Native Village, Dance Performance & Totem Park via Princess
   2. Spend remaining time exploring the town and lunch (Annabelle's vs Alaska Fish House)
   3. NOTE: I would love for them to do an easy hike that would allow them to see some scenery and possibly wildlife. In an ideal world, they would do some Bear viewing tour, but those are all 400-1000 bucks, which is out of budget for this port.
   4. NOTE #2: I offered for them to do the Misty Fjords Seaplane, and because they're doing the helicopter tour and a boat tour later on, decided against it. I could persuade them if people felt strongly about it.
2. Juneau - July 23, - 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM
   1. Harv and Marv's Whale Watching Tour - 10:30 AM - 2:30 PM
   2. Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Park + Nugget Fall's
   3. Rest of time exploring Juneau with Dinner at Tracy's?
   4. NOTE: I offered doing Whale Watching + Helicopter here - but they didn't want to pack the day with too many things since it's a long trip.
3. Skagway - July 24 - 7:00 AM - 8:30 PM
   1. TEMSCO Glacier Helicopter Tour - one benefit of this is that if it gets canceled due to weather, they could be rescheduled for the Denali Helicopter Tour later on
   2. Some other activity? - Klondike Summit/Suspension Bridge?
4. Mt. McKinley Wilderness Lodge (nearest excursion site is Talkeetna?) - July 27 afternoon through July 29 morning
   1. Mahay's Riverboat Devil's Canyon Adventure
   2. NOTE: I offered doing Talkeetna Air Taxi's flightseeing tour - but I think they want a Helicopter.
   3. Not sure what else can really do here
5. Denali Princess Wilderness Lodge - July 29 afternoon - July 31 AM
   1. Included Denali Natural History Tour - Upgrade to Tundra Wilderness vs Kantishna
   2. Not sure if there's something to fit in July 29 afternoon

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

716,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, love",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area.

* I was seeing a lot of recommendations to book things in advance, but I want to be flexible in case of inclement weather (plus, still figuring out the itinerary). That said, for a lot of the things I was looking at (flightseeing, Kenai Fjords, trains, various kayaking trips, etc.), there’s plenty of availability, even if I wanted to go tomorrow or next week. Is it still advisable to book things weeks in advance, or would a few days suffice at this point? Is there a bigger tourist spike in August?

* I’ll be doing the Skinny Raven Half on 8/20 and want to try to keep my training up. While I feel decent about running opportunities in Anchorage (within downtown or in parks), I wanted to see if there would be similar opportunities near Denali or Seward - I’m used to road running, but I can do paved or even trails. I figured that Seward would be easy enough to just run around downtown, but I’m a bit iffy on Denali - one idea I had was running up and down Parks Highway for a few miles, but if this is a moronic idea, I’d definitely like to know (and also understand what to expect in terms of wildlife). 

* On another note, based on what I saw from a previous post, bear spray is advisable for runs - I wanted to confirm that this is the case even in Anchorage and Seward. Already planning on no headphones, but open to other recommendations and advice from runners, since I’m so used to running in cities and city parks. 

* Finally, I’ve done some baseline research, but I’m always up for any suggestions for restaurants and breweries, anywhere between Denali and Seward - especially love unique local food and smaller neighborhood brewpubs whose products I would never find out of state. If any of you have places you want to shout out, would love to hear about it!

Thanks in advance - can’t wait to visit!",2023-07-22 16:23:23

727,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, hate",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

729,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, hate",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
730,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
731,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, hate",Cold Weather Clothing?,"As someone who lives where it barely ever freezes, and has the wardrobe to match that, what would you all suggest for warm weather clothes for someone who is planning on moving to Alaska?  Specifically Anchorage, but maybe Fairbanks, which I gather means a few tens of degrees colder...

As far articles of clothing, I mean things that might be often overlooked or things that might be better done a certain way?  Like, should I consider getting pants with the insulation sewn right into the pants?  Or should I wear those thermal underpants, with regular pants over them?

Having never really shopped for cold weather clothing, are there any brands that really stand out that I should preferentially consider?  I have a Carhartt jacket I've had for ages, it's a great work jacket, but it's never been tested in sub-zero temperatures, so I have no idea how it would fair.

Thanks in advance, I look forward to hearing y'all's suggestions!",2024-01-10 23:10:52
732,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, hate",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice?

738,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, hate",Tips for driving in hazardous conditions.,"On the way into to town I passed 3 accidents. One of them involving around 6 cars, and busted up guardrails. 
You can avoid wrecking your and other peoples vehicals and putting other folks lives in danger by following a few tips. 
Tip 1, identify the hazardous condition. Some folks will not be able to do this until they are on the road, but there is actually a better way. If it warms up enough for stuff to thaw, and then gets cold again enough to freeze, then a light dusting of snow will make the road really slick.
Tip 2, leave early.
Tip 3, slow down.
Tip 4, feel free to let the other drivers on the road know that there is a hazard ahead by using your hazard lights. 
Tip 5, stay in one lane. Changing lanes tends to kick up the snow on the road, and blind the drivers behind you. Now it's clear that some people do not care, and just want to get to their destination as fast as possible. You do not have to care about what they want. On days like today, it is actually perfectly acceptable to drive slow in the left lane. 
Each of these accidents had officers on the road attending them. I would hate to have their job on a day like today. ",2024-02-25 00:10:37

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

748,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, enjoy",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

And it reminded me that Ive wanted to live in Alaska for decades. Kinda forgot for a few years. 
Always enjoyed winter and darkness. Where Im at it gets -30° and lasts 5 months
Im a disabled veteran. Dont work. I just want peace and solitude. I cant find it. And am wondering if.  Theres any area where quiet is in abundance, but also maybe a bar and grocery store? Perfect cities that fit this?
Also the canadian show rust valley with the trees?
Somewhere in Ak similar to that?
So I can check zillow,
I am NOT a, californian trying to change politics or anything, not go in any areas where and outsider might he hated for reasons, I dont know any social politics or prejudices..
Indont want that..just to he left alone mostly
Just want a quiet warm place to maybe chill tell I die. 

But also maybe open up a small business like a pizza place, burgers or mexican food? Anything like that needed in a small towns? I come from a city of 408, and its not remote enough for me. 

I do recognize its its hard to live in some areas, but maybe I want that? I wont know tell I do..

753,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

754,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, enjoy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
755,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, enjoy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

756,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, enjoy",Cold Weather Clothing?,"As someone who lives where it barely ever freezes, and has the wardrobe to match that, what would you all suggest for warm weather clothes for someone who is planning on moving to Alaska?  Specifically Anchorage, but maybe Fairbanks, which I gather means a few tens of degrees colder...

As far articles of clothing, I mean things that might be often overlooked or things that might be better done a certain way?  Like, should I consider getting pants with the insulation sewn right into the pants?  Or should I wear those thermal underpants, with regular pants over them?

Having never really shopped for cold weather clothing, are there any brands that really stand out that I should preferentially consider?  I have a Carhartt jacket I've had for ages, it's a great work jacket, but it's never been tested in sub-zero temperatures, so I have no idea how it would fair.

Thanks in advance, I look forward to hearing y'all's suggestions!",2024-01-10 23:10:52
757,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, enjoy",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

768,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, enjoy",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

770,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, dislike",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

782,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

783,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, annoying",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

793,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, annoying","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

795,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, happy",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50
796,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, happy",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
797,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, happy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
798,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, happy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality.

* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

813,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, annoyed",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

814,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, annoyed",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

824,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, annoyed","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

827,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, comfortable",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

As far articles of clothing, I mean things that might be often overlooked or things that might be better done a certain way?  Like, should I consider getting pants with the insulation sewn right into the pants?  Or should I wear those thermal underpants, with regular pants over them?

Having never really shopped for cold weather clothing, are there any brands that really stand out that I should preferentially consider?  I have a Carhartt jacket I've had for ages, it's a great work jacket, but it's never been tested in sub-zero temperatures, so I have no idea how it would fair.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢).

831,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, comfortable",Which UHaul Trailer should I choose for the Alaska Highway?,"Driving the Alaska highway down to the lower 48 from AK this August. Have a 2022 Ford Escape and more specifically the 4 cylinder AWD Hybrid model. Ford advertises that I should have around 1500 lb towing capacity and that a small teardrop trailer is fine to tow. I'm looking into getting the UHaul trailer hitch installed that has a 4500 lb capacity. There are two trailers from UHaul that I think I should be comfortable to tow. I'm waffling between the 4x8 and the 5x8 enclosed trailers they have to offer. The 4x8 already weighs around 850lbs and the 5x8 listed as 900lbs. So I was thinking to be safe and within 80% of my towing capacity it only gives me between 300 - 350 lbs depending on which model I were to choose. 

My biggest question for the group is whether or not the 4x8 or 5x8 would be reasonable on the Alaska Highway. It's not my first time driving it so I do remember the steep hills, which is a cause of my concern. If there was anyone with advice weather the 5x8 would be better off than the 4x8 or vice-a-versa it would be greatly appreciated. 

  
I have already looked into possibly pulling my car via their 10ft box trailer and it comes out closer to $3k which is less appealing.

I have enough saved to live comfortably and pay for fuel/food/living expenses and extensive engine/vehicle repairs on my van if needed.  I can survive for a year and have enough to get back to main land and back to lower 48 if things don't work out.  

I have plenty of experience working 12+ hours/day in sub zero temperatures.

My dream is to work on a vessel in the Bering Sea.  I don't have much experience on boats.  Just a few fishing charters in the Atlantic in not so rough waters.

How hard would it be for me to find a greenhorn job on a commercial vessel out of Homer before I start my employment on a factory vessel in Dutch?  Any tips on how to get a job quickly when I get there?  Is it better to just go straight to Dutch and look for a job there?

I will be in Homer in 1 month.

Update:
After reading all of the comments about trawling vessels and doing a little research I’ve decided that’s not something I want to be a part of.  Probably the reason it was so easy to land that job is because they have a hard time finding people who are willing to do that type of fishing.  I really appreciate all of the feedback from everyone here.",2023-07-08 21:11:58
842,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, comfortable","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57
843,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, love",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

Then I went to Fairbanks and wow it's like 86 out here and I have to wear shorts!  As a Texan this shocked me.

I didnt have enough time to visit the far north.

At any rate, I absolutely love your state.  Alaska truly is the last frontier and it's beauty was far greater than I anticipated.  My closest experience to you guys was Colorado but I have to say that Alaska blows Colorado out of the water.  Dont take your state for granted guys, there is stunning beauty everywhere you look that makes all the other states very jealous!

845,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, love",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50
846,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, love",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

847,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, love",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

848,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, love",I took a seasonal job in Seward this summer.,"I will be starting seasonal work in Seward this summer. I am beyond excited. I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).

849,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

I have been doing as much research as I can online about what would be the best path for me to take to become a Bush Pilot in God's country. Should I do my flight school here in Central VA or move to Anchorage or Fairbanks, get a welding job and take flight school there since I'll be more adjusted to the weather Alaska will have to offer during my training? I want to be apart of this community, it can sound campy and probably just spew from someone who's young and dumb (I'm 25 as of posting this) but the allure of being someone that can take hunters, researchers, hikers, campers, and guides out to difficult spots and to assist in bringing supplies to communities, helping others out, being apart of something great is constantly drumming at my soul. I am at a stage of analysis paralysis and there's contradictory information out there on which is the best path. I don't want to take a lazy route, I want to earn this and be great to myself and others, I just want to know the best way to go about it. 

Thank you for y'alls time and I hope I got the wording of this out. If it helps any extra on where I'd like to make a more permanent living, the south east to south central parts of the state is what's attractive to me as a place for home but that can change once in the motion and falling in love with another spot.

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
854,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.

861,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, love",Excursion Recommendations - Planning for Parents,"Hi Everyone,

I am planning an Alaska Cruise for my parents. I've booked a Cruise and Land Tour via Princess on the Sapphire from July 20 - Aug 1, 2024. I would love to hear people's thoughts on the comments, excursions picked, and if they would swap it out for any other experiences. My parent's do not have any mobility issues, but are also in their 70s and not the most active. They could do a few miles hiking, but would nothing too adventurous and wouldn't want my Mom on uneven terrain for too long.  Also, my Mom is vegetarian.

1. Ketchikan - July 22 - 6:00 AM - 2:00 PM
   1. Saxman Native Village, Dance Performance & Totem Park via Princess
   2. Spend remaining time exploring the town and lunch (Annabelle's vs Alaska Fish House)
   3. NOTE: I would love for them to do an easy hike that would allow them to see some scenery and possibly wildlife. In an ideal world, they would do some Bear viewing tour, but those are all 400-1000 bucks, which is out of budget for this port.
   4. NOTE #2: I offered for them to do the Misty Fjords Seaplane, and because they're doing the helicopter tour and a boat tour later on, decided against it. I could persuade them if people felt strongly about it.
2. Juneau - July 23, - 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM
   1. Harv and Marv's Whale Watching Tour - 10:30 AM - 2:30 PM
   2. Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Park + Nugget Fall's
   3. Rest of time exploring Juneau with Dinner at Tracy's?
   4. NOTE: I offered doing Whale Watching + Helicopter here - but they didn't want to pack the day with too many things since it's a long trip.
3. Skagway - July 24 - 7:00 AM - 8:30 PM
   1. TEMSCO Glacier Helicopter Tour - one benefit of this is that if it gets canceled due to weather, they could be rescheduled for the Denali Helicopter Tour later on
   2. Some other activity? - Klondike Summit/Suspension Bridge?
4. Mt. McKinley Wilderness Lodge (nearest excursion site is Talkeetna?) - July 27 afternoon through July 29 morning
   1. Mahay's Riverboat Devil's Canyon Adventure
   2. NOTE: I offered doing Talkeetna Air Taxi's flightseeing tour - but I think they want a Helicopter.
   3. Not sure what else can really do here
5. Denali Princess Wilderness Lodge - July 29 afternoon - July 31 AM
   1. Included Denali Natural History Tour - Upgrade to Tundra Wilderness vs Kantishna
   2. Not sure if there's something to fit in July 29 afternoon

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

Since we met there, we thought it would be sweet.
 
I've always been an avid xcountry skier, and she's good at both, but neither of us have ever done an overnight winter backcountry trip. We do have lots of experience in cold weather though ( lived in fbx) and we love to backpack. 

Through reccomendationa from friends, we decided to celebrate by doing a part of ressurection pass: the north entrance to Caribou Creek Cabin ( 7 -8 miles). 

I haven't seen much info on doing this part in the winter.

864,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, love",Sightseeing late September (extending work trip),"First of all, I completely understand that the last week of September means potentially rainy weather, closures, and a limit on some of the typical Alaskan experiences tourists like myself might experience in the summer months. That said, I’m in anchorage for work, the dates are set, and I plan to extend the visit with my wife (both early thirties). 

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time. 

Appreciate any guidance this group can provide. Have visited Alaska before, love it, and can’t wait to be back with my wife.",2023-08-13 20:54:47

866,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, love",Seeking advice on Kenai Fjords boat tour in bad weather,"Hiya locals and thank you for having me - it took me way too long to get here but your lovely state is the last one I needed to check off on my visit to all 50! Huzzah!

I have an all day Kenai Fjords boat tour booked on one of the very small boats. The marine forecast has turned and we may not be able to get to Aialik Bay. My question is- do you think the benefits of a small boat tour make it worth it to keep this booking and possibly stay in Resurrection Bay? Or should I go with a larger boat that is not quite so weather dependent? I'm in it more for the wildlife possibilities, especially since the fog might make scenery visibility nil. 
But as you all know, the small boat tours are $$$ compared to the big boys and this was one of the biggest splurges of our trip.

Cut down the tree two years ago, took a moisture reading and it said it was 17%, so being that these stumps last FOREVER in nature as is, I figure if I create a base that sheds water, and use a weather proof oil or some stain (any recommended materials for this particular piece would be appreciated!)",2023-07-23 16:23:19
869,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, love",Questions in advance of trip,"I’m currently planning a two-week trip to Alaska with my girlfriend (August 8-21). At the moment, specific timing is mostly up in the air, but we’re 100% planning on Denali, Seward, and some day trips near Anchorage. While the flair is mostly tongue-in-cheek - I always try to do my own research before asking questions on Reddit - I still have a few questions either based on what I’ve read or that I couldn’t find online:

* I was seeing a lot of recommendations to book things in advance, but I want to be flexible in case of inclement weather (plus, still figuring out the itinerary). That said, for a lot of the things I was looking at (flightseeing, Kenai Fjords, trains, various kayaking trips, etc.), there’s plenty of availability, even if I wanted to go tomorrow or next week. Is it still advisable to book things weeks in advance, or would a few days suffice at this point? Is there a bigger tourist spike in August?

* I’ll be doing the Skinny Raven Half on 8/20 and want to try to keep my training up. While I feel decent about running opportunities in Anchorage (within downtown or in parks), I wanted to see if there would be similar opportunities near Denali or Seward - I’m used to road running, but I can do paved or even trails. I figured that Seward would be easy enough to just run around downtown, but I’m a bit iffy on Denali - one idea I had was running up and down Parks Highway for a few miles, but if this is a moronic idea, I’d definitely like to know (and also understand what to expect in terms of wildlife). 

* On another note, based on what I saw from a previous post, bear spray is advisable for runs - I wanted to confirm that this is the case even in Anchorage and Seward. Already planning on no headphones, but open to other recommendations and advice from runners, since I’m so used to running in cities and city parks. 

* Finally, I’ve done some baseline research, but I’m always up for any suggestions for restaurants and breweries, anywhere between Denali and Seward - especially love unique local food and smaller neighborhood brewpubs whose products I would never find out of state. If any of you have places you want to shout out, would love to hear about it!

Thanks in advance - can’t wait to visit!",2023-07-22 16:23:23
870,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, hate",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

872,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
873,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, hate",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice?

875,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, hate",Raining More than Normal???,"Hi Y'all,

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.

876,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, hate",Do Kenai Fjord Tours sellout?,We are planning our first trip to Alaska this upcoming summer and are interested in taking one of the Kenai boat tours most likely either Major Marine or Kenai Fjord Tours.

878,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, hate",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

881,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

882,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, enjoy",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
883,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, enjoy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
884,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, enjoy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

889,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, enjoy",Raining More than Normal???,"Hi Y'all,

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?

890,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, enjoy",Just booked my tix for Alaska Sep 16-23rd,"I’ve been trying to plan Alaska with Friends/fam so long, since it’s never been possible I’m doing it solo. I’m curious if there are any day hiking tours or groups I could join. Don’t want to go meandering on long hikes alone. 

Will be in Anchorage, Denali, and Kenai. Please throw in any local recommendations on food/bars/attractions. 

I do photography so any related suggestions there would be great. Also, wondering about how easy it is to find fellow locals who’d be down to exploring or chilling, just curious as to the culture as well. Since, I am by myself it would be exciting to find likeminded people who enjoy outdoors and learn about Alaska with them.

UPDATE: something’s I have booked can still be canceled or changed for a fee, is it worth rescheduling my flight to 12th through 18th? (Will the weather, and overall opportunities be better?)",2023-09-02 11:57:30
891,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, enjoy","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

893,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, dislike",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

894,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

897,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, happy",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50
898,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, happy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
899,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, happy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

901,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, happy",Work in the Aleutian’s?,"Hello,

As the title states, I’m wondering if folks have any idea of work that would allow me to travel the Aleutian Islands?

Long story short, I grew up in Alaska and have since moved away. The last year or so I have been feeling the urge to swim back upstream (sorry, couldn’t resist) but would like to explore someplace new.  

I’m definitely not into working in a cannery and I don’t know how I’d fair on a fishing boat but other than those two, if I get to be outside I’m into it.

Not that it’s directly applicable but I’ve been a wildland firefighter these last eight years so hard work and weather won’t scare me off. In fact, I think I’d be most happy camping and hiking heavy loads through the wilderness.

Thanks for any suggestions!",2023-03-24 06:11:20
902,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, happy",Raining More than Normal???,"Hi Y'all,

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.

903,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, happy",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

904,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, annoyed",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

907,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, comfortable",Which UHaul Trailer should I choose for the Alaska Highway?,"Driving the Alaska highway down to the lower 48 from AK this August. Have a 2022 Ford Escape and more specifically the 4 cylinder AWD Hybrid model. Ford advertises that I should have around 1500 lb towing capacity and that a small teardrop trailer is fine to tow. I'm looking into getting the UHaul trailer hitch installed that has a 4500 lb capacity. There are two trailers from UHaul that I think I should be comfortable to tow. I'm waffling between the 4x8 and the 5x8 enclosed trailers they have to offer. The 4x8 already weighs around 850lbs and the 5x8 listed as 900lbs. So I was thinking to be safe and within 80% of my towing capacity it only gives me between 300 - 350 lbs depending on which model I were to choose. 

My biggest question for the group is whether or not the 4x8 or 5x8 would be reasonable on the Alaska Highway. It's not my first time driving it so I do remember the steep hills, which is a cause of my concern. If there was anyone with advice weather the 5x8 would be better off than the 4x8 or vice-a-versa it would be greatly appreciated. 

  
I have already looked into possibly pulling my car via their 10ft box trailer and it comes out closer to $3k which is less appealing.   


Thank you!",2024-05-30 02:45:06
908,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, comfortable",Raining More than Normal???,"Hi Y'all,

I'm planning on visiting Alaska either next week and while I've been informed upfront that it rains 300 days an year in Alaska, it's surprising that most days have 100% forecast of rain throughout the day on NPS website.


Thought it'd be best to ask the folks who live there how to interpret these weather reports:

Is it infrequent, heavy showers with bright sunshine in between or is it cloudy (overcast and gloomy) and drizzling like 80% of the time?

I'm  interested in flightseeing and hiking a bunch (Matanushka, Harding Icefield, Denali etc. ) and watching wildlife. Pretty much your average tourist, I guess.


1. Hiking is the primary interest so is there a possibility that trails might be closed off if there's heavy rains? 

2. I'm also uncertain if the flightseeing operators at Talkeetna for the Summit tours + Glacier Landings (TAT or K2) operate during rains even though Denali is said to have its own weather system. Could anyone confirm if they operate even when it's raining? And what's the likelihood of that happening if it rains? I've been told Denali or Mckinley has its own weather system but the weater reports look pretty bleak.

3. I'm 95% sure there's zero shot of seeing the auroras with such heavy cloud cover, even at Fairbanks. Would that be correct or would it still be worth making the trip up from Anchorage?


I really tried googling and looking at livestreams but they're either too blurry or inconclusive.


TIA!",2023-08-24 02:12:08
909,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, comfortable",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

910,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunny, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

911,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunny, love","Moving up in August, y'all are freaking me out (please reassure)","Hi folks! 

My husband and I accepted great jobs in the Anchorage area and are moving up in August. 

I've been really excited about it, but now that we're getting close, we have had so many friends/family be super negative about it and then I also keep seeing posts here about how miserable and awful it is and I'm freaking out a bit. 

I know that it's dark/cold right now and has been for a few months and that the negativity is condensed because no one comes on the internet to say how okay and normal everything is going. 

Info about our situation:

-We've been up twice, late October and late November and loved the beauty and nature even though it was damp and we liked the friendly but kinda gritty/crusty/real vibe of the people we met. 

-The pay is great. We will have more than enough to cover the increased cost of living, rapidly pay off student loans, save up for a house, go on a sunny vacation or two in the winter and most importantly - leave if we hate it. 

-We are outdoorsy homebodies that like hiking, fishing and camping and recently picked up snowshoeing for a winter sport. We've lived all over the country, have snow driving experience, and the other jobs we were considering were actually way, way more rural even though they were in the lower 48. 

-Kinda freaked out by bears, earthquakes and avalanches but I'm sure we'll get over it.

Anyways, thank you for reading my crazy rambling and please tell me it will all be okay :)",2023-03-08 04:26:24

913,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunny, love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
914,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunny, love",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

918,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunny, hate","Moving up in August, y'all are freaking me out (please reassure)","Hi folks! 

My husband and I accepted great jobs in the Anchorage area and are moving up in August. 

I've been really excited about it, but now that we're getting close, we have had so many friends/family be super negative about it and then I also keep seeing posts here about how miserable and awful it is and I'm freaking out a bit. 

I know that it's dark/cold right now and has been for a few months and that the negativity is condensed because no one comes on the internet to say how okay and normal everything is going. 

Info about our situation:

-We've been up twice, late October and late November and loved the beauty and nature even though it was damp and we liked the friendly but kinda gritty/crusty/real vibe of the people we met. 

-The pay is great. We will have more than enough to cover the increased cost of living, rapidly pay off student loans, save up for a house, go on a sunny vacation or two in the winter and most importantly - leave if we hate it. 

-We are outdoorsy homebodies that like hiking, fishing and camping and recently picked up snowshoeing for a winter sport. We've lived all over the country, have snow driving experience, and the other jobs we were considering were actually way, way more rural even though they were in the lower 48. 

-Kinda freaked out by bears, earthquakes and avalanches but I'm sure we'll get over it.

Anyways, thank you for reading my crazy rambling and please tell me it will all be okay :)",2023-03-08 04:26:24
919,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunny, hate",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

921,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunny, enjoy",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

924,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunny, dislike",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

I will be 23(F) and he will be 25 on our trip. We are from Ontario and have lots of experience portaging, camping, kayaking, climbing, etc. Wr have booked flights to ANC and will be in Alaska aug 7-25. We are planning on spending time in Anchorage for climbing, the kenai peninsula, and juneau. 

We have so far booked our flights to/from Juneau for Aug 16-23. We have booked a kayak/hiking tour in seward with sunny cove. We are planning to book white water rafting in Hope and a whale watching/salmon eating day in Juneau. We need at least 1 full day to climb on the Turnagain Arm. 

We are bringing our camping and climbing gear, and will camp pretty much the whole time, making a few occasional grocery runs to survive on ramen and hotdogs. We will be getting around via bus and turo rentals.

When I leave for work or errands, I turn it down to 50F. When I'm home, 68 is almost tolerable with warm layers. But I find that most of the time it's not quite comfortable. 70 feels great, and I'm concerned about costs, but a few dollars a month is maybe worth not being uncomfortable.

934,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunny, comfortable",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime.

937,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunny, comfortable",Moving to Homer. Is it hard to get a greenhorn job on a commercial fishing boat?,"This is something I have been planning for a while now and I have been lurking on this sub reading all of the 'I'm moving to Alaska' posts for a while now.

I have a job lined up on a large factory trawler that operates out of Dutch.  The wait time to get on a vessel is up to 8 months.  I have a GMC cargo van which I am perfectly comfortable living out of.  I have everything I need to keep warm and I have plenty of experience maintaining engines and vehicles in sub zero temperatures.  I also have enough money to get to Homer and ferry my van to Dutch if that's what I decide to do.  I have enough saved to live comfortably and pay for fuel/food/living expenses and extensive engine/vehicle repairs on my van if needed.  I can survive for a year and have enough to get back to main land and back to lower 48 if things don't work out.  

I have plenty of experience working 12+ hours/day in sub zero temperatures.

My dream is to work on a vessel in the Bering Sea.  I don't have much experience on boats.  Just a few fishing charters in the Atlantic in not so rough waters.

How hard would it be for me to find a greenhorn job on a commercial vessel out of Homer before I start my employment on a factory vessel in Dutch?  Any tips on how to get a job quickly when I get there?  Is it better to just go straight to Dutch and look for a job there?

I will be in Homer in 1 month.

Update:
After reading all of the comments about trawling vessels and doing a little research I’ve decided that’s not something I want to be a part of.  Probably the reason it was so easy to land that job is because they have a hard time finding people who are willing to do that type of fishing.  I really appreciate all of the feedback from everyone here.",2023-07-08 21:11:58

939,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, love",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
943,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

944,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, love",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

945,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, love",M(27) visiting Alaska for work in late March. ,"I hope this finds everyone well. I got the opportunity to visit Alaska for work March 23-30 coming from Pennsylvania. This got sprung on me very recently so excuse me if I have misunderstood or am inconsiderate regarding everything I have already read about the state/cities. I’m going to just list my itinerary and I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or anything. I’m a chill dude, tall w/ some muscles, get along with everyone and usually enjoy doing anything. 4/20 & drinking as well (the breweries interest me). At the most I would exclude any like “winter sports” skiing and such.

For reference, my work is visiting military bases across the country and talking with some folks. And isn’t much more than an hour per base visit. 

23rd - arrive in Fairbanks

24th - free day suggestions for anything goes

25th - I work until probably 2:30pm as I’ll be at Wainright/Eielson. Maybe a lunch/dinner spot/something chill like murphys dome for the aurora.

26th - going to Greely early AM, will be free from 11AM and on. Hot springs maybe? Something more.

27th - Then Clear Space Force in Anderson in the AM, then driving to anchorage. Would like to stop in Denali for a lil spot to eat before making it down.

28th or 29th - one of these days are free. I have to meet at Elmendorf in the AM on one.  I was looking to do one of the plane tours over a glacier or the Denali park. I know it’s $$ but seems worth it. Then I would love to make it Homer or Seward on the day I’m free. 

Then I go home the 30th. This is the way the trip has to be set up essentially. If you made it this far I appreciate you. I would love to meet down to earth people in a new place the whole opposite side of the continent that’s beauty will give me an asthma attack, so if y’all are chill and can help show me around on my free time in either Fairbanks or Anchorage I’d buy you a beer on my per diem lmao.

947,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, hate",Advice for moving to and finding work in Alaska?,"I am in the early stages of looking into what it would take to move to and find work in Alaska, as I grew up in colder climates (not Alaska cold) and really hate being hot all the time. On top of the fact that the Alaskan lifestyle and beautiful landscapes are much nicer to photograph than the mojave desert. I much prefer being cold all the time. I've got a car, a passport, 3 cats, and two rooms worth of stuff. I could fit pretty much everything I care about except my fridge, desk, and dresser into my car. What would be the most affordable way to move that stuff?
Also, I have been looking at various job websites, but I'm wondering if anyone has a better strategy for this. I'm trying to find work, ideally in IT as I am A+ certified. But I currently work as a technical service writer/customer service/IT Manager at an RV repair shop for about 3 years.

948,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, hate",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

949,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

950,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, enjoy",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
951,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, enjoy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
952,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, enjoy",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

953,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, enjoy",M(27) visiting Alaska for work in late March. ,"I hope this finds everyone well. I got the opportunity to visit Alaska for work March 23-30 coming from Pennsylvania. This got sprung on me very recently so excuse me if I have misunderstood or am inconsiderate regarding everything I have already read about the state/cities. I’m going to just list my itinerary and I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or anything. I’m a chill dude, tall w/ some muscles, get along with everyone and usually enjoy doing anything. 4/20 & drinking as well (the breweries interest me). At the most I would exclude any like “winter sports” skiing and such.

For reference, my work is visiting military bases across the country and talking with some folks. And isn’t much more than an hour per base visit. 

23rd - arrive in Fairbanks

24th - free day suggestions for anything goes

25th - I work until probably 2:30pm as I’ll be at Wainright/Eielson. Maybe a lunch/dinner spot/something chill like murphys dome for the aurora.

26th - going to Greely early AM, will be free from 11AM and on. Hot springs maybe? Something more.

27th - Then Clear Space Force in Anderson in the AM, then driving to anchorage. Would like to stop in Denali for a lil spot to eat before making it down.

28th or 29th - one of these days are free. I have to meet at Elmendorf in the AM on one.  I was looking to do one of the plane tours over a glacier or the Denali park. I know it’s $$ but seems worth it. Then I would love to make it Homer or Seward on the day I’m free. 

Then I go home the 30th. This is the way the trip has to be set up essentially. If you made it this far I appreciate you. I would love to meet down to earth people in a new place the whole opposite side of the continent that’s beauty will give me an asthma attack, so if y’all are chill and can help show me around on my free time in either Fairbanks or Anchorage I’d buy you a beer on my per diem lmao. APPRECIATE YA

955,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

957,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, happy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
958,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, happy",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

959,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, annoyed",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

964,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, comfortable",Best layers and sleeping bag for end of June outside Anchorage?,"My teen is spending a week camping with a guide/ group of other teens at the end of June and I'm just trying to get recommendations for what layers are most comfortable for the swing in temps and mosquitoes? They'll be a couple hours outside of Anchorage, and they're doing the typical outdoorsy activities, a smaller hike, group team building we might expect to see for a teen summer trip. He's typically a sweatpants and t shirt kind of guy. 

they're staying in canvas tents except for one night where they get to ""sleep under the stars"" if they want to. I read he might need a 20 degree bag but I was considering a 32 and getting him a liner because he sleeps hot? So if he's too warm he could just go without the liner or shed other layers he'll have (ie take off the fleece, keep the hat and warm socks). 

Thank you for your suggestions. I struggle with there being too many choices and conflicting advice and kind of freeze with decisions in the overwhelm. We do need to be budget conscious, he's on scholarship we aren't ""just"" putting him on a plane to Alaska for a week lol, but I'm also not worried about whether we'll ever use the gear again, my 12 yo goes camping with scouts frequently so things will get used.

965,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, comfortable",Moving to Homer. Is it hard to get a greenhorn job on a commercial fishing boat?,"This is something I have been planning for a while now and I have been lurking on this sub reading all of the 'I'm moving to Alaska' posts for a while now.

I have a job lined up on a large factory trawler that operates out of Dutch.  The wait time to get on a vessel is up to 8 months.  I have a GMC cargo van which I am perfectly comfortable living out of.  I have everything I need to keep warm and I have plenty of experience maintaining engines and vehicles in sub zero temperatures.  I also have enough money to get to Homer and ferry my van to Dutch if that's what I decide to do.  I have enough saved to live comfortably and pay for fuel/food/living expenses and extensive engine/vehicle repairs on my van if needed.  I can survive for a year and have enough to get back to main land and back to lower 48 if things don't work out.  

I have plenty of experience working 12+ hours/day in sub zero temperatures.

My dream is to work on a vessel in the Bering Sea.  I don't have much experience on boats.  Just a few fishing charters in the Atlantic in not so rough waters.

How hard would it be for me to find a greenhorn job on a commercial vessel out of Homer before I start my employment on a factory vessel in Dutch?  Any tips on how to get a job quickly when I get there?  Is it better to just go straight to Dutch and look for a job there?

I will be in Homer in 1 month.

Update:
After reading all of the comments about trawling vessels and doing a little research I’ve decided that’s not something I want to be a part of.  Probably the reason it was so easy to land that job is because they have a hard time finding people who are willing to do that type of fishing.  I really appreciate all of the feedback from everyone here.",2023-07-08 21:11:58

967,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, love",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

I've been camping most of my life and have been around most of the lower 48 camping, camped with many different people from many walks of life and tried to learn as much as I can from their mistakes so I can reduce my chance of having a dangerous run in with wildlife. Over the years I have become somewhat of a good camper and the person I would be traveling with is very well travelled. 

I have never heard of people saying you ""need"" to bring a gun to camp or backpack until I brought up going to Alaska, and honestly what everyone is saying makes a lot of sense. I know some people bring a gun maybe hiking the AT or going deep into the back country just based on preference, but from what I've heard it seems like it makes a lot of sense to bring one. 

I have always considered it for past trips but it just seemed like too much of a haste, and initially I figured driving through Canada with a firearm isn't even worth it but from what I've heard/seen (which is very little but regardless) I don't want to take my chances. 

I would love to hear some other people weigh in on this debate. I am very well aware that using a gun improperly is more dangerous than just not having one at all and that in the moment it can be incredibly hard to focus and shoot accurately at a charging animal or what have you.

July 12: Moved to our new home in Alaska. It is so beautiful here. The mountains are so majestic. Can't hardly wait to see the snow covering them.

August 22:  Alaska is the most beautiful place on earth. The leaves are turning all colors with shades of red and orange. Went for a ride today through the beautiful mountains and saw two moose. They are truly magnificent. Hope it will snow soon. I love Alaska.

September 15: Moose season is almost over now. Cant imagine how anyone would want to kill such a beautiful creature. Hope it wil snow soon. I love Alaska.

October 28: It snowed last night. Woke up with everything blanketed in white. It looks like a postcard. We went outside and cleaned the snow off the steps and took turns shoveling the driveway. We had a snowball fight (I won), and when the snowplow came by, we had to shovel the driveway again. What a beautiful place. I think I'll live here for ever.

November 5th: More snow last night. Ilove it! The snow plow came by again. I love it here.

December 27: 20 below zero is not nearly as cold as most people think. Had the car towed into a garage to thaw out; must have had an old battery. Took a cab to work.

January 4: More of the white crap fell last night. I've got blisters on my hands from shoveling. I think the snow plow hides around the comer and waits until I'm done shoveling the driveway. Butthead!

Jan 22: More fricking snow. If lever get my hands on that SOB who drives that snow plow I will rip his testicles off. Dont know why they don't put more gravel on the fricken roads.

Feb 1: More white crap. Been inside for three days except for shoveling out of the driveway after that plow goes through every time. Can't go anywhere, car's stuck in a mountain of white crap. The weatherman says to expect another 10 inches of crap tonight. Do you know how many shovels full of snow that is?

Feb 16: The fricken weatherman was wrong. We got 34 inches of the white crap yesterday. At this rate it wont melt before summer. The snow plow got stuck today. The SOB came to the door to ask if he could borrow my snow shovel.

March: 2 Finally got out of the house today. Went to the store to get some food and on the way back a stupid fricken moose ran out in front of my car and I hit him. Did about $6,000.00 damage to the car. Those fricken beasts should be killed. Wish a hunter had killed them all last summer.

April 23: Took the car to the garage in town. You would not believe all the paint and window chipping from all the fricken gravel they put on the roads.

I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).

It's Alaska, it's known for beautiful scenery/landscapes, wildlife, the night sky outside the city, and winters that make you question your sanity and safety.

Specifically, we'd be looking at Anchorage, Kodiak, Juneau, Valdez, or maybe Bethel (less likely though.) I'd be working in the power industry, so not too worried about job prospects 

For context, we're considering Alaska for these primary reasons: we love the outdoors, want to have a small homestead, and we want to be around a like minded community that enjoys the same lifestyle. Plus I'd love to work for a company that helps with rural electrification/renewable energy like AVEC or any of the other power coops.

These are my thoughts/questions:

We'd like to visit Anchorage during the ""worst"" time in Alaska for at least a week to see if we can handle the low temp/long nights. Is that like Dec-Jan? Are there any reasons that's a bad idea?

Ive heard cost of living is high and seen stuff like $10 gallons of milk or $45 two-packs of olive oil. Are the groceries just high across the board or could some of the cost be mitigated with lifestyle changes?

We'd like about 2 acres to have goats, chickens, etc. to help with food costs and be more self sufficient. Anybody have experience with that and if it actually helps? Are there other options for cheaper but healthy food?

Housing/acreage seemed surprisingly sparse. Call me silly, but I would have thought there would be more options available. Is the current market pretty standard or is it just a bad time to look. (Perhaps more listings in the summer?)

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

I'm heading to Kenai this summer, and I'd like to learn how to fish! (I'd also like to learn how to gut a fish.) I'm generally more interested in fishing in rivers than the ocean (but I could be convinced), and I think fly fishing sounds a lot of fun.

Does anyone know of any good companies (based out of Seward or Homer) that will patiently show a newbie the basics, do some flyfishing, and catch some fun, smaller fish? What kind of fish should I aim for?

HOWEVER, wherever we were in Alaska we were able to find some bomb ass jerky that I actually enjoyed, was subtly sweet, and not too too sticky on our fingers. 


But I have a dodongo brain, and cannot for the life of me remember what the brand the jerky was. I remember a few key attributes

- honey was a listed ingredient (but, it Honey wasn't the ""flavor"" name, or anything)
- came in a clear bag with a label slapped on
- it had a black-pepper flavor variety, that I think had the honey ingredient, but I'm not sure
- I'm 99% certain it's not Old Trapper, Tillamook, Jack Links, or anything else you can find on the mainland. This was an Alaskan brand


And that's it. I would love some help finding this because I've searched online for months, and I cannot seem to find this bag/brand of jerky. Much love and thanks to y'all 🙏🙏🙏

Dear redditers of Alaska,

&#x200B;

Let’s start with that I am not a US citizen. I am from Hungary and I am looking for legal options on how to get a job and eventually move to Alaska. (People told me just get married to a citizen, but I don’t wanna go that way. Hopefully in 5 years when I get asked “how I made it to Alaska” I would like to be able to say that I earned it)

&#x200B;

So far I have lived 4 years in Canada, Alberta.  I was working in a summer camp as a kitchen coordinator and Immediately fell in love with the atmosphere. I tried moving to Canada, but they have an Express Entry System where applicants upload their info, education, language exam, work experience and get evaluated. Basically, the people with the highest scores get in.

Here comes the problem, that didn’t go well because to be honest I don’t have very valuable papers. I am not an engineer, lawyer, doctor or technician.

Now as far as I understand it’s similar in the US, to get a work visa, an employer must sponsor the employee and apply for the visa, and that’s only possible if the person has the skills and qualifications that others don’t and there are insufficient available workers in the US for the position.

&#x200B;

A quick summary about me and then I am done. I am a 32 years old guy and my qualification is graphic designer and videographer/editor. 

Although right now I am working as a firearms instructor at a shooting range with 7 years experience, zeroing the optics on hunter’s rifles and also teaching techniques similar to USPSA for sport shooters. I also create video commercials for the range. (I probably wouldn’t get hired in the US with these skills because there must be loads who know  the exact same things.)

&#x200B;

What do you think what qualification should I get that would be valuable in Alaska so an employer might consider hiring a foreigner? Are there shortages of workforce in any area?

I would totally work at a lumber/saw mill, construction, carpentry, or wild life protection as well. Studying in Alaska popped in my mind too but that’s super expensive, although that would be a great way to get the right qualification and experience.

&#x200B;

Do you know any foreigners who made it there?

Thank you for your time and any advice is welcomed.

One thing for sure, I am not giving up, some day I will make it there.",2023-04-03 13:40:14

I can’t do big cities and spend an hour in traffic every day. 

I would like a location with no more than 4 months of snow, rain, or ice seasons.

1024,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24

(Especially during the summer and winter). (Don't move to the south if you hate humidity.) We visited Fairbanks during the early winter a few years ago. We started following SomersinAlaska on YT in 2020 and were so psyched for the trip there. Everyone was kind and friendly. They offered sights for us to see, places to go eat. The only time I was recognized as a tourist was when I dug out my fiance's camera. We have such beautiful memories. I wanted to think more positively about the state y'all live in. So, with that said, what are some of your favourite ""first time"" experiences whether born and raised, a transplant, or a tourist?

Take care!

1026,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, hate",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

**UPDATE JULY '24**

Loved it, going back in the winter. Place is a blast. Make friends in the community and it makes all the difference. Cannot wait.",2024-03-25 15:15:33
1029,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, hate","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

1030,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, hate",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice? 

Thanks!  ",2024-02-28 18:41:22

While I do think Alaska is the most beautiful state in the whole country, during my visit I was more interested in the history and culture of the state.

I plan on returning next summer, but this time I want to focus on visiting as many Native villages as I can. I have a list of villages I’m considering.

Obviously I’m going to have narrow this list down to maybe 20 villages, but I just wanted to see if anyone has been to any of these and what your experiences were there.

P.S. I am fully aware that most of them are going to be fly-in only communities and that will be a large portion of my expenses. And I know that Alaska is a very expensive state in general.

I'm a Texan hoping to vacation up in Alaska at some point next year in 2025, when money hopefully won't be quite as tight, been saving up a while. It's something I've always wanted to do, most likely up in Fairbanks and/or Anchorage (since it's only about 350 miles apart anyway). Here's where things get a little funky, though not at all serious

The majority of my family believes I'm crazy for wanting to go visit Alaska in the winter, in fact my sister is the only one on my side. Not that I wouldn't also want to do it in the summer, because I absolutely would love to do that too some other time. But hear me out first at least, hear my reasoning:

I know very well it'll be absolutely even more than frigid cold outside, and likely even too cold for my my native Texan ass, but I do still believe I'd enjoy it in a bit of an odd way. It's Alaska, it's known for beautiful scenery/landscapes, wildlife, the night sky outside the city, and winters that make you question your sanity and safety. I feel like part of the experience would be to go through mentioned Alaskan winters as well, not just the summer activities. I want the authentic Alaskan experience, dammit!

1038,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, enjoy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
1039,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, enjoy",Managing expectations about moving to Alaska,"Hello everyone! I looked through a bunch of posts about moving to Alaska, but I do still have some some questions to make sure it'd be the right choice for my family.

Specifically, we'd be looking at Anchorage, Kodiak, Juneau, Valdez, or maybe Bethel (less likely though.) I'd be working in the power industry, so not too worried about job prospects 

For context, we're considering Alaska for these primary reasons: we love the outdoors, want to have a small homestead, and we want to be around a like minded community that enjoys the same lifestyle. Plus I'd love to work for a company that helps with rural electrification/renewable energy like AVEC or any of the other power coops.

These are my thoughts/questions:

We'd like to visit Anchorage during the ""worst"" time in Alaska for at least a week to see if we can handle the low temp/long nights. Is that like Dec-Jan? Are there any reasons that's a bad idea?

Ive heard cost of living is high and seen stuff like $10 gallons of milk or $45 two-packs of olive oil. Are the groceries just high across the board or could some of the cost be mitigated with lifestyle changes?

We'd like about 2 acres to have goats, chickens, etc. to help with food costs and be more self sufficient. Anybody have experience with that and if it actually helps? Are there other options for cheaper but healthy food?

Housing/acreage seemed surprisingly sparse. Call me silly, but I would have thought there would be more options available. Is the current market pretty standard or is it just a bad time to look. (Perhaps more listings in the summer?)

Any other info for the areas I mentioned that someone from the lower 48 should know before moving up? Any help is appreciated!",2023-02-01 05:21:25
1040,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, enjoy",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

**UPDATE JULY '24**

Loved it, going back in the winter. Place is a blast. Make friends in the community and it makes all the difference. Cannot wait.",2024-03-25 15:15:33
1043,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, enjoy","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

HOWEVER, wherever we were in Alaska we were able to find some bomb ass jerky that I actually enjoyed, was subtly sweet, and not too too sticky on our fingers. 


But I have a dodongo brain, and cannot for the life of me remember what the brand the jerky was. I remember a few key attributes

- honey was a listed ingredient (but, it Honey wasn't the ""flavor"" name, or anything)
- came in a clear bag with a label slapped on
- it had a black-pepper flavor variety, that I think had the honey ingredient, but I'm not sure
- I'm 99% certain it's not Old Trapper, Tillamook, Jack Links, or anything else you can find on the mainland. This was an Alaskan brand


And that's it. I would love some help finding this because I've searched online for months, and I cannot seem to find this bag/brand of jerky. Much love and thanks to y'all 🙏🙏🙏

My wife and I are looking to come to Alaska for a week in August after a legitimately brutal working year. We are kind of new to planning trips on our own and have done a lot of research into the dos/do nots in Alaska. That said, there really is a ton of information out there and it's becoming hard to try and choose absolute winners of activities that would also give us time to  ""smell the roses""/truly enjoy every spot we go to.

I'm more of a mountaineer than my wife but we're young (30 yo) and can handle physically arduous things barring 1v1 bear fights.

&#x200B;

1.) For a weeks trip, what are some absolute DO NOT MISS things that we should do? Alaska looks beautiful and it seems like we can't go wrong with anything

2.) Our general itinerary would be to fly to Anchorage, then drive to Denali, and then down to the Seward/Homer area. But it sounds like 1 week is not enough time to really do those places justice so we may have to end up cutting out Denali for the below reasons.

We are torn between Denali and the Kenai Peninsula. On one hand, everyone talks about Denali but we saw that there is a landslide that severely limits ground transportation in the area. We mulled over a flight tour but some have pointed out that this summer, rain and fog have made them 50/50 shots. Kenai sounds/looks amazing but compared to some of the bigger sites in Alaska, I haven't heard much about it.

3) I've always wanted to hike on a glacier and was curious as to recommendations on what would be a good one that doesn't take all day. I've heard good things about the Byron, Portage, and Matanuska glaciers that seem to be all a relatively short driving distance from Anchorage.

4) Are snow mobile/ATV tours worth it? They are heavily marketed on some sites.

1055,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, dislike",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

1058,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, dislike","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

1061,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, annoying",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

**UPDATE JULY '24**

Loved it, going back in the winter. Place is a blast. Make friends in the community and it makes all the difference. Cannot wait.",2024-03-25 15:15:33
1064,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, annoying","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

1065,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, annoying",Planning a Week Long Trip in Alaska - Open to ALL suggestions!,"Hey guys! Not to be that annoying tourist trying to plan a trip but also totally being that guy.

My wife and I are looking to come to Alaska for a week in August after a legitimately brutal working year. We are kind of new to planning trips on our own and have done a lot of research into the dos/do nots in Alaska. That said, there really is a ton of information out there and it's becoming hard to try and choose absolute winners of activities that would also give us time to  ""smell the roses""/truly enjoy every spot we go to.

I'm more of a mountaineer than my wife but we're young (30 yo) and can handle physically arduous things barring 1v1 bear fights.

&#x200B;

1.) For a weeks trip, what are some absolute DO NOT MISS things that we should do? Alaska looks beautiful and it seems like we can't go wrong with anything

2.) Our general itinerary would be to fly to Anchorage, then drive to Denali, and then down to the Seward/Homer area. But it sounds like 1 week is not enough time to really do those places justice so we may have to end up cutting out Denali for the below reasons.

We are torn between Denali and the Kenai Peninsula. On one hand, everyone talks about Denali but we saw that there is a landslide that severely limits ground transportation in the area. We mulled over a flight tour but some have pointed out that this summer, rain and fog have made them 50/50 shots. Kenai sounds/looks amazing but compared to some of the bigger sites in Alaska, I haven't heard much about it.

3) I've always wanted to hike on a glacier and was curious as to recommendations on what would be a good one that doesn't take all day. I've heard good things about the Byron, Portage, and Matanuska glaciers that seem to be all a relatively short driving distance from Anchorage.

4) Are snow mobile/ATV tours worth it? They are heavily marketed on some sites.

1069,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, happy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24

1071,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, happy",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

**UPDATE JULY '24**

Loved it, going back in the winter. Place is a blast. Make friends in the community and it makes all the difference. Cannot wait.",2024-03-25 15:15:33
1074,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, happy","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

I'm 25 and currently live in Arizona and am desperate to get out. I've got a good amount of experience in management/customer service and IT. Never went to college either. I was interested in Alaska as I love the outdoors and saw the potential of working there as a bit of an escape. I also like the idea of being able to save up some money a bit better than how I am now.

I'm not expecting anything life changing, but just want to experience life more. As for questions I have:

1. I'd probably be interested in working around Denali or other parks, within a lodge would be ideal. What have been your experiences with that if you know?


2. How does housing and transport work? I've found through research that some places do offer basic housing which would be more than enough for me, I'm a simple guy.

I probably have more which I may add on later, but these are my main concerns. I'd like to save up some money to fund a move from AZ to MN, so that is also something I am thinking about.

Any insight would be appreciated! I am also up for making connections with people who have had first hand experiences with this so feel free to reach out and I'd be happy to chat :) appreciate you all 🫂",2023-11-16 17:46:46

1087,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, annoyed",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

**UPDATE JULY '24**

Loved it, going back in the winter. Place is a blast. Make friends in the community and it makes all the difference. Cannot wait.",2024-03-25 15:15:33
1090,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, annoyed","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

I'm more of a mountaineer than my wife but we're young (30 yo) and can handle physically arduous things barring 1v1 bear fights.

&#x200B;

1.) For a weeks trip, what are some absolute DO NOT MISS things that we should do? Alaska looks beautiful and it seems like we can't go wrong with anything

2.) Our general itinerary would be to fly to Anchorage, then drive to Denali, and then down to the Seward/Homer area. But it sounds like 1 week is not enough time to really do those places justice so we may have to end up cutting out Denali for the below reasons.

We are torn between Denali and the Kenai Peninsula. On one hand, everyone talks about Denali but we saw that there is a landslide that severely limits ground transportation in the area. We mulled over a flight tour but some have pointed out that this summer, rain and fog have made them 50/50 shots. Kenai sounds/looks amazing but compared to some of the bigger sites in Alaska, I haven't heard much about it.

3) I've always wanted to hike on a glacier and was curious as to recommendations on what would be a good one that doesn't take all day. I've heard good things about the Byron, Portage, and Matanuska glaciers that seem to be all a relatively short driving distance from Anchorage.

4) Are snow mobile/ATV tours worth it? They are heavily marketed on some sites.

1095,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, comfortable",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

1098,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, comfortable","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

We wanted to take the ferry but the tickets sold out. We want our car up there since we'll be there all summer and don't want to rely on public transportation. My husband is from Idaho and is comfortable in snowy conditions. My car is older and I'm worried about being stranded on the highway.
I've read a lot about the lower 48 to Juneau but haven't seen much about Portland to Juneau specifically. Here are my questions:

Are the road conditions in April passable?

Where can you camp in your car along the way/ where are the best places to stay?

Recommended routes or ways to break up the trip? i.e. how many hours for how many days.
We're trying to make this a shorter trip since it's just for work, not really sight seeing.

He's typically a sweatpants and t shirt kind of guy. 

they're staying in canvas tents except for one night where they get to ""sleep under the stars"" if they want to. I read he might need a 20 degree bag but I was considering a 32 and getting him a liner because he sleeps hot? So if he's too warm he could just go without the liner or shed other layers he'll have (ie take off the fleece, keep the hat and warm socks). 

Thank you for your suggestions. I struggle with there being too many choices and conflicting advice and kind of freeze with decisions in the overwhelm.

Is it hard to get a greenhorn job on a commercial fishing boat?,"This is something I have been planning for a while now and I have been lurking on this sub reading all of the 'I'm moving to Alaska' posts for a while now.

I have a job lined up on a large factory trawler that operates out of Dutch.  The wait time to get on a vessel is up to 8 months.  I have a GMC cargo van which I am perfectly comfortable living out of.  I have everything I need to keep warm and I have plenty of experience maintaining engines and vehicles in sub zero temperatures.  I also have enough money to get to Homer and ferry my van to Dutch if that's what I decide to do.  I have enough saved to live comfortably and pay for fuel/food/living expenses and extensive engine/vehicle repairs on my van if needed.  I can survive for a year and have enough to get back to main land and back to lower 48 if things don't work out.  

I have plenty of experience working 12+ hours/day in sub zero temperatures.

My dream is to work on a vessel in the Bering Sea.  I don't have much experience on boats.  Just a few fishing charters in the Atlantic in not so rough waters.

How hard would it be for me to find a greenhorn job on a commercial vessel out of Homer before I start my employment on a factory vessel in Dutch?  Any tips on how to get a job quickly when I get there?  Is it better to just go straight to Dutch and look for a job there?

I will be in Homer in 1 month.

Update:
After reading all of the comments about trawling vessels and doing a little research I’ve decided that’s not something I want to be a part of.  Probably the reason it was so easy to land that job is because they have a hard time finding people who are willing to do that type of fishing.  I really appreciate all of the feedback from everyone here.",2023-07-08 21:11:58

1108,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

1112,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, love",Cost to Live in Alaska,"Hey y'all. Kids and I are moving to Alaska this spring after the house sales. I've always wanted to move there since I was a kid reading Balto, Julie of the Wolves, Hatchet, My Side of the Mountain, and Island of the Blue Dolphins (know some aren't about Alaska but it's always reminded me of it for some reason).  The kids want to move also so we are all on board.

We've been redoing the house with lots of sweat equity so it sells better/for more. Getting the trucks (all 4wd)  rock solid and replacing everything on them. We've been downsizing and focusing on keeping tools and other needs vs stuff/wants/furniture. Ive homeschooled all the kids so lots of stuff. Researching by watching every YouTube homestead/fish/hunt/family video I can find, asking questions, taking notes and even watching Alaskan Costco and Grocery Hauls to see how the cost of groceries compare.

We are gardeners/farmers/homesteaders and the kids are 15-24 yrs old. Kids have grown up farming; garden, meat rabbits, pigs, dairy goats, chickens, ducks, quail, turkeys and we process our own meat as well as can; PC & WB, ferment, bake bread, make cheese, and dehydrate.

We don't like living here in TN at all. We moved here 4 years ago, after my husband passed away and I lost our farm in Ohio. I've a mortgage with a low interest rate on 3 acres here in TN.  We raise most all our food. We can afford living here but we are so unhappy and simply don't fit in here. 

 Kids can't afford to live on their own working full time    and  they want to find partners someday who work as hard as they do. I don't blame them as it's hard to find anyone with a good work ethic or people who are willing to work things out in a relationship based on what I've seen.. They were raised not to settle for red 
 flags and that relationships don't just happen...they're a give and take and no one should keep score. 

Lol, I know I sound like, ""I'm not like other girls."" right now. 

I work from home and that makes nearly all my income. The farm brings in the extra we need. I can continue working from home when we move to Alaska as long as I've internet. 

I know we will take a hit with the farm income/ animals since everyone gardens up there and there is a short season and we will not be set up the first year and will be starting over and just handling  infrastructure so to speak. We are canning up any extra veggies to  help counter that financial hit while we get established. We will be bringing some livestock babies with us; piglets, meat rabbits, Icelandics, and  quail. We are converting a trailer so they'll have housing when we get there we don't have to build and bringing our portable solar fencing with us for runs until we get a permanent space for them.

My oldest has a ""good job"" here working 12-14 hr days 6 days a week at $12 and he can just now afford an apartment and utilities on his own...as long as he was to eat ramen and doesn't meet someone. So he still lives at home and he is how we are affording to remodel the house.  I also grew up doing this so while no expert I was raised by parents who were/are and I can do enough diy to stay out of trouble.

We plan on building a small home/cabin on a few acres when we move up to Alaska. Our old farm was a tiny house on solar (but my husband who passed set it up so I'm not confident'going off grid' without a backup plan) and we had rainwater catchment as well as a spring fed pond for watering the animals. We also had a composting toilet. Ohio gets down to -10 but doesn't have the amount of snow AK does nor the constant negative temps. Ohio has a ton of humidity though and folks keep telling me Alaska is a dry snow so you don't get wet so I've my doubts about this information.  I keep thinking a freezer is dry inside but you'll still freeze to death locked in it even with your coveralls.

We also heated with wood. Bub and Sexy Beast of a Hubby cut it for us. Girls and I are not well versed on chopping wood but aren't afraid to learn. We did stack well though lol. I've also bought safety gear, a chainsaw light enough for me/the girls a big one for my moose of a son.  Figure a log splitter will equalize us in who can split wood.

I  read an article about evictions, folks not able to feed their family, cost of food has doubled and I'm having a slight panic attack and need your knowledge and experience. 

I put in our income in a cost of living and it said in order to maintain our current lifestyle (which is a very diy/self sufficient) we would need to earn an extra 35k a year!

How much are your utilities? What is the cost per kilowatt(?). How.much is water? How many in your family? How many cords per year for how many sq feet? How much is a cord of seasomed wood ( will need a years worth off the bat since wood we'd get would be wet). How much are groceries and how much of your own food do you grow/raise/harvest?

I want to connect to the grid and be on the road system cause I want to make sure we don't freeze to death or die in a snow drift and electric is not my most comfortable thing to work with plus winter means we'd still be running a generator so...maybe later once we're not building the property.
We do not have any friends here (being a widow tends to freak people out that it's contagious or they think yosomesomeu want their janky husband...heifer I had a King and this Queen doesn't settle for junk.) bit are working to build community.  We left Ohio mainly due to extended family that we have 0 contact with. 

Kids and I are on our own in every way and we are ok with that but they want healthy supportive partners  and we would love to  have friends that like bonfires, grilling out, see value in a stocked pantry, will trade you some time processing chickens or pigs for chickens or pork, don't only do things that require $ (like don't kids hike anymore? When did a date have to be an expensive restaurant? Picnics rock and it doesn't require going broke. And never hear....""Why don't you just buy meat from the grocery store?""

Am I being paranoid or is this a dream we need to put on hold longer, save up more (money from house selling is what/how we will buy land & materials up there)? I am a worrier and house goes up this spring. I get it could be cold feet but we are talking moving everything almost 5000 miles over 12 days. 

Any helpful advice and constructive criticism would be most helpful and welcome.",2023-07-24 21:10:44
1113,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, love",Looking for romantic cabin locations outside of Anchorage.,"My partner and are I celebrating our 5 year anniversary this weekend and there may be some proposal plans in the mix. We were going to do a back country overnight ski trip in ressurection pass, but unfortunately I just got diagnosed with some heart issues and am "" not allowed to do heavy exercise"" for the time being. 

Now we have no idea where to go for our anniversary. I'd like to do some light snow shoeing, but in the evening I want to stay in a cabin somewhere ( we spent our first years together living in a dry cabin). 

Any cabin reccomendations for a 1 night trip?

1. A little bit of a remote feel
2. Fine with a 1 mile walk in
3. Would love to stay at a more rustic place ( no heat, just woodstove).

Is it hard to get a greenhorn job on a commercial fishing boat?,"This is something I have been planning for a while now and I have been lurking on this sub reading all of the 'I'm moving to Alaska' posts for a while now.

I have a job lined up on a large factory trawler that operates out of Dutch.  The wait time to get on a vessel is up to 8 months.  I have a GMC cargo van which I am perfectly comfortable living out of.  I have everything I need to keep warm and I have plenty of experience maintaining engines and vehicles in sub zero temperatures.  I also have enough money to get to Homer and ferry my van to Dutch if that's what I decide to do.  I have enough saved to live comfortably and pay for fuel/food/living expenses and extensive engine/vehicle repairs on my van if needed.  I can survive for a year and have enough to get back to main land and back to lower 48 if things don't work out.  

I have plenty of experience working 12+ hours/day in sub zero temperatures.

My dream is to work on a vessel in the Bering Sea.  I don't have much experience on boats.  Just a few fishing charters in the Atlantic in not so rough waters.

How hard would it be for me to find a greenhorn job on a commercial vessel out of Homer before I start my employment on a factory vessel in Dutch?  Any tips on how to get a job quickly when I get there?  Is it better to just go straight to Dutch and look for a job there?

I will be in Homer in 1 month.

Update:
After reading all of the comments about trawling vessels and doing a little research I’ve decided that’s not something I want to be a part of.  Probably the reason it was so easy to land that job is because they have a hard time finding people who are willing to do that type of fishing.

1143,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunlight, love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

1145,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunlight, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

1146,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunlight, love",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

Is it hard to get a greenhorn job on a commercial fishing boat?,"This is something I have been planning for a while now and I have been lurking on this sub reading all of the 'I'm moving to Alaska' posts for a while now.

I have a job lined up on a large factory trawler that operates out of Dutch.  The wait time to get on a vessel is up to 8 months.  I have a GMC cargo van which I am perfectly comfortable living out of.  I have everything I need to keep warm and I have plenty of experience maintaining engines and vehicles in sub zero temperatures.  I also have enough money to get to Homer and ferry my van to Dutch if that's what I decide to do.  I have enough saved to live comfortably and pay for fuel/food/living expenses and extensive engine/vehicle repairs on my van if needed.  I can survive for a year and have enough to get back to main land and back to lower 48 if things don't work out.  

I have plenty of experience working 12+ hours/day in sub zero temperatures.

My dream is to work on a vessel in the Bering Sea.  I don't have much experience on boats.  Just a few fishing charters in the Atlantic in not so rough waters.

How hard would it be for me to find a greenhorn job on a commercial vessel out of Homer before I start my employment on a factory vessel in Dutch?  Any tips on how to get a job quickly when I get there?  Is it better to just go straight to Dutch and look for a job there?

I will be in Homer in 1 month.

Update:
After reading all of the comments about trawling vessels and doing a little research I’ve decided that’s not something I want to be a part of.  Probably the reason it was so easy to land that job is because they have a hard time finding people who are willing to do that type of fishing.

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

1162,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, warm, love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

1164,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, warm, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Is it hard to get a greenhorn job on a commercial fishing boat?,"This is something I have been planning for a while now and I have been lurking on this sub reading all of the 'I'm moving to Alaska' posts for a while now.

I have a job lined up on a large factory trawler that operates out of Dutch.  The wait time to get on a vessel is up to 8 months.  I have a GMC cargo van which I am perfectly comfortable living out of.  I have everything I need to keep warm and I have plenty of experience maintaining engines and vehicles in sub zero temperatures.  I also have enough money to get to Homer and ferry my van to Dutch if that's what I decide to do.  I have enough saved to live comfortably and pay for fuel/food/living expenses and extensive engine/vehicle repairs on my van if needed.  I can survive for a year and have enough to get back to main land and back to lower 48 if things don't work out.  

I have plenty of experience working 12+ hours/day in sub zero temperatures.

My dream is to work on a vessel in the Bering Sea.  I don't have much experience on boats.  Just a few fishing charters in the Atlantic in not so rough waters.

How hard would it be for me to find a greenhorn job on a commercial vessel out of Homer before I start my employment on a factory vessel in Dutch?  Any tips on how to get a job quickly when I get there?  Is it better to just go straight to Dutch and look for a job there?

I will be in Homer in 1 month.

Update:
After reading all of the comments about trawling vessels and doing a little research I’ve decided that’s not something I want to be a part of.  Probably the reason it was so easy to land that job is because they have a hard time finding people who are willing to do that type of fishing.

1175,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, warm, hate",Tips for driving in hazardous conditions.,"On the way into to town I passed 3 accidents. One of them involving around 6 cars, and busted up guardrails. 
You can avoid wrecking your and other peoples vehicals and putting other folks lives in danger by following a few tips. 
Tip 1, identify the hazardous condition. Some folks will not be able to do this until they are on the road, but there is actually a better way. If it warms up enough for stuff to thaw, and then gets cold again enough to freeze, then a light dusting of snow will make the road really slick.
Tip 2, leave early.
Tip 3, slow down.
Tip 4, feel free to let the other drivers on the road know that there is a hazard ahead by using your hazard lights. 
Tip 5, stay in one lane. Changing lanes tends to kick up the snow on the road, and blind the drivers behind you. Now it's clear that some people do not care, and just want to get to their destination as fast as possible. You do not have to care about what they want. On days like today, it is actually perfectly acceptable to drive slow in the left lane. 
Each of these accidents had officers on the road attending them. I would hate to have their job on a day like today. ",2024-02-25 00:10:37
1176,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, warm, hate",Moving to Homer. Is it hard to get a greenhorn job on a commercial fishing boat?,"This is something I have been planning for a while now and I have been lurking on this sub reading all of the 'I'm moving to Alaska' posts for a while now.

I have a job lined up on a large factory trawler that operates out of Dutch.  The wait time to get on a vessel is up to 8 months.  I have a GMC cargo van which I am perfectly comfortable living out of.  I have everything I need to keep warm and I have plenty of experience maintaining engines and vehicles in sub zero temperatures.  I also have enough money to get to Homer and ferry my van to Dutch if that's what I decide to do.  I have enough saved to live comfortably and pay for fuel/food/living expenses and extensive engine/vehicle repairs on my van if needed.  I can survive for a year and have enough to get back to main land and back to lower 48 if things don't work out.  

I have plenty of experience working 12+ hours/day in sub zero temperatures.

My dream is to work on a vessel in the Bering Sea.  I don't have much experience on boats.  Just a few fishing charters in the Atlantic in not so rough waters.

How hard would it be for me to find a greenhorn job on a commercial vessel out of Homer before I start my employment on a factory vessel in Dutch?  Any tips on how to get a job quickly when I get there?  Is it better to just go straight to Dutch and look for a job there?

I will be in Homer in 1 month.

Update:
After reading all of the comments about trawling vessels and doing a little research I’ve decided that’s not something I want to be a part of.  Probably the reason it was so easy to land that job is because they have a hard time finding people who are willing to do that type of fishing.

1179,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, warm, enjoy",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

I do get full benefits and a relocation package of like 7.5k. I been seeing a few postings on the housing Facebook page. Dunno if it changes anything….

 my main concerns are still transportation (from city to city. Someone says it’s 30 minutes by plane to and from Juneau but cost wise I don’t wanna pay 100+ for recreational sports which already will be costly.) 

Sitka is apparently too warm for recreation? However I saw someone say it’s not for those who are NOT adventurous. I enjoy hiking, I want to try new things and get out but I do NOT wanna be trapped in doors all day also I suppose to idea of constant rain is also not pleasant to think about.

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

They'll be a couple hours outside of Anchorage, and they're doing the typical outdoorsy activities, a smaller hike, group team building we might expect to see for a teen summer trip. He's typically a sweatpants and t shirt kind of guy. 

they're staying in canvas tents except for one night where they get to ""sleep under the stars"" if they want to. I read he might need a 20 degree bag but I was considering a 32 and getting him a liner because he sleeps hot? So if he's too warm he could just go without the liner or shed other layers he'll have (ie take off the fleece, keep the hat and warm socks). 

Thank you for your suggestions. I struggle with there being too many choices and conflicting advice and kind of freeze with decisions in the overwhelm. We do need to be budget conscious, he's on scholarship we aren't ""just"" putting him on a plane to Alaska for a week lol, but I'm also not worried about whether we'll ever use the gear again, my 12 yo goes camping with scouts frequently so things will get used.

1211,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunshine, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

1212,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunshine, love",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

1214,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunshine, love",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

I have a job lined up on a large factory trawler that operates out of Dutch.  The wait time to get on a vessel is up to 8 months.  I have a GMC cargo van which I am perfectly comfortable living out of.  I have everything I need to keep warm and I have plenty of experience maintaining engines and vehicles in sub zero temperatures.  I also have enough money to get to Homer and ferry my van to Dutch if that's what I decide to do.  I have enough saved to live comfortably and pay for fuel/food/living expenses and extensive engine/vehicle repairs on my van if needed.  I can survive for a year and have enough to get back to main land and back to lower 48 if things don't work out.  

I have plenty of experience working 12+ hours/day in sub zero temperatures.

My dream is to work on a vessel in the Bering Sea.  I don't have much experience on boats.  Just a few fishing charters in the Atlantic in not so rough waters.

How hard would it be for me to find a greenhorn job on a commercial vessel out of Homer before I start my employment on a factory vessel in Dutch?  Any tips on how to get a job quickly when I get there?  Is it better to just go straight to Dutch and look for a job there?

I will be in Homer in 1 month.

Update:
After reading all of the comments about trawling vessels and doing a little research I’ve decided that’s not something I want to be a part of.  Probably the reason it was so easy to land that job is because they have a hard time finding people who are willing to do that type of fishing.

How would today's modern EV's fare in North Dakota's cold winters?  What happens if one sits outside in sub zero degree temperatures for 8 hours while someone is at work or sits outside for a week?  (Not everyone has an insulated garage.)  Can you start one up at -10 degrees F without inflicting any damage on the batteries or the vehicle?

Not all of the vehicles will have to be electric, so maybe it would make sense for North Dakota to be an outlier with a higher proportion of gas vehicles.

How would today's modern EV's fare in North Dakota's cold winters?  What happens if one sits outside in sub zero degree temperatures for 8 hours while someone is at work or sits outside for a week?  (Not everyone has an insulated garage.)  Can you start one up at -10 degrees F without inflicting any damage on the batteries or the vehicle?  How will the cold affect the lifespan of the expensive batteries?  Will they lose their ability to provide range over time?

Not all of the vehicles will have to be electric, so maybe it would make sense for North Dakota to be an outlier with a higher proportion of gas vehicles.

**EDIT**  Thanks for everyone's responses.  For clarification I'm not anti-EV; I'd love to have one.  I'm just worried about the practical issues that could affect their longevity in this climate.  (I may be making a new vehicle purchase in the next few years, and EV vs. ICE could become an issue.)  Some additional questions that have occurred to me:

* What is the long term effect on the batteries after they've dealt with sitting out at -10 deg F year after year?  Can we expect expensive battery replacement costs after several years?

* Will we see special cold weather versions that come with battery heaters?",2023-04-15 08:21:32

For info we were originally from the desert in AZ and I spent a  good portion of my time driving off anything resembling a road due to the environment we lived in.

1. We have a 2019 pickup that rests nightly outside. Last year I installed a trickle charger on it for the battery, but I am still having an issue with starting it on the cold mornings (starter turns fine, but it takes multiple attempts to cold start). Is this pretty normal and fine for weather like this, or is this something that could cause damage to the engine and I need to get a block heater? *Have gotten conflicting info on that one about people having block heaters on their newer trucks, even sitting outside.

2. My wife is looking for a new vehicle and is a tad nervous driving in the winter because she went off the road last year in her AWD vehicle (From people I have talked to, this is just something that happens to a good portion of people out here) and I explain to her that it isn't too bad. I recommend to her that we replace her vehicle with something 4WD and learn to use it, but half of the people she knows swear by AWD, the other half tell her 4WD, clearance and knowing when to use the 4WD is better.. so pluses and minuses?

We love the cold so moving from 110 degrees to this has been great for us... but horrible for everything we own.",2024-01-13 07:54:05

1261,North Dakota,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, love",Vehicle Advice For ND,"Our family moved to ND a few years ago and we were spoiled this winter with the weather, but with this recent change we decided to start looking in to some options for our vehicles and any advice... because we get conflicting info at times. For info we were originally from the desert in AZ and I spent a  good portion of my time driving off anything resembling a road due to the environment we lived in.

1. We have a 2019 pickup that rests nightly outside. Last year I installed a trickle charger on it for the battery, but I am still having an issue with starting it on the cold mornings (starter turns fine, but it takes multiple attempts to cold start). Is this pretty normal and fine for weather like this, or is this something that could cause damage to the engine and I need to get a block heater? *Have gotten conflicting info on that one about people having block heaters on their newer trucks, even sitting outside.

2. My wife is looking for a new vehicle and is a tad nervous driving in the winter because she went off the road last year in her AWD vehicle (From people I have talked to, this is just something that happens to a good portion of people out here) and I explain to her that it isn't too bad. I recommend to her that we replace her vehicle with something 4WD and learn to use it, but half of the people she knows swear by AWD, the other half tell her 4WD, clearance and knowing when to use the 4WD is better.. so pluses and minuses?

We love the cold so moving from 110 degrees to this has been great for us... but horrible for everything we own.",2024-01-13 07:54:05

I've been photographing abandoned places for 16 years, and I do not trespass (and neither should any of you!). But I took these pictures last year while driving from Minot to Bismarck. I grew up in a big family, and our parents couldn't really afford any big vacations, so driving up to Minot every summer for the fair was our yearly vacation, and it was always amazing! 




As such, I've been slowly watching this barn fall down ever since I was little. Now that I'm an adult, I'm documenting it as best I can! It's just north of Wilton.




I would love to send these images to the owners. I'm not sure if they're interested, but if anyone knows who they are, can you please connect them with me somehow?

I am considering an end of summer trip to the International Peace Garden around the beginning of September and I’m looking for some suggestions/ideas/advice regarding it. 

1. For starters it’s looking like 2 to 3 people will be coming with me, not all of us have passports, so from what I’ve read it’s acceptable to visit with a birth certificate and a drivers license? Or am I reading this wrong? I just don’t want us to drive all the way up there and not be able to visit because I mis-read something so simple. 

2. Where is the best place to stay? We prefer hotel accommodations and aren’t interested in camping or Airbnb….is it worth driving all the way into Minot to stay or is there an area I’m missing that would be better? We are hoping to be in a place with a few good restaurant options, but also need to remain reasonable in cost. 

3. Is there anything else in the area we shouldn’t miss? I have been to Minot and Rugby before, but could visit them again if there’s something I’ve missed.

4. Considering a possible visit to Williston and Grand Forks as well, if there are any suggestions for those I’d love them.

1319,North Dakota,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, love","North Dakota, extreme cold, and Electric Vehicles","I've probably asked this a couple times here and there, but with renewed talk of the federal government wanting to force electric vehicles on people, it seems relevant.  

How would today's modern EV's fare in North Dakota's cold winters?  What happens if one sits outside in sub zero degree temperatures for 8 hours while someone is at work or sits outside for a week?  (Not everyone has an insulated garage.)  Can you start one up at -10 degrees F without inflicting any damage on the batteries or the vehicle?  How will the cold affect the lifespan of the expensive batteries?  Will they lose their ability to provide range over time?

[EPA reportedly planning to announce significant limits on tailpipe emissions to boost electric vehicle adoption](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/08/epa-reportedly-planning-to-announce-significant-limits-on-tailpipe-emissions.html)

Not all of the vehicles will have to be electric, so maybe it would make sense for North Dakota to be an outlier with a higher proportion of gas vehicles.

**EDIT**  Thanks for everyone's responses.  For clarification I'm not anti-EV; I'd love to have one.  I'm just worried about the practical issues that could affect their longevity in this climate.  (I may be making a new vehicle purchase in the next few years, and EV vs. ICE could become an issue.)  Some additional questions that have occurred to me:

* What is the long term effect on the batteries after they've dealt with sitting out at -10 deg F year after year?  Can we expect expensive battery replacement costs after several years?

* Will we see special cold weather versions that come with battery heaters?",2023-04-15 08:21:32

1321,North Dakota,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, love",Vehicle Advice For ND,"Our family moved to ND a few years ago and we were spoiled this winter with the weather, but with this recent change we decided to start looking in to some options for our vehicles and any advice... because we get conflicting info at times. For info we were originally from the desert in AZ and I spent a  good portion of my time driving off anything resembling a road due to the environment we lived in.

1. We have a 2019 pickup that rests nightly outside. Last year I installed a trickle charger on it for the battery, but I am still having an issue with starting it on the cold mornings (starter turns fine, but it takes multiple attempts to cold start). Is this pretty normal and fine for weather like this, or is this something that could cause damage to the engine and I need to get a block heater? *Have gotten conflicting info on that one about people having block heaters on their newer trucks, even sitting outside.

2. My wife is looking for a new vehicle and is a tad nervous driving in the winter because she went off the road last year in her AWD vehicle (From people I have talked to, this is just something that happens to a good portion of people out here) and I explain to her that it isn't too bad. I recommend to her that we replace her vehicle with something 4WD and learn to use it, but half of the people she knows swear by AWD, the other half tell her 4WD, clearance and knowing when to use the 4WD is better.. so pluses and minuses?

We love the cold so moving from 110 degrees to this has been great for us... but horrible for everything we own.",2024-01-13 07:54:05

BISMARCK — A proposal to provide free school meals to low-income K-12 students took the long road through the North Dakota Legislature, but the program won approval from lawmakers with the clock running out on their biennial session.

Both chambers of the Legislature voted by wide margins Friday, April 28, to pass Senate Bill 2284, a broad school funding proposal that contains $6 million to cover meal costs for students from low-income families over the next two-year budget cycle.

The bill now goes to Gov. Doug Burgum, whose spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A federal program already provides free meals to students from families making below 130% of the federal poverty level, so the state allocation would cover kids with family incomes between 130-200% of the poverty level.

That means families of four with incomes at or below $60,000 would qualify for the free lunch program in North Dakota, according to current poverty level income figures.

Last month, the Republican-led Senate killed a bill containing the free lunch funding by a one-vote margin. The GOP-run House, which had previously passed the lunch funding, then resurrected the $6 million appropriation by inserting it into Senate Bill 2284.

Several senators spoke against the lunch funding Friday, arguing that the issue of paying for low-income students’ meals had been twisted out of proportion by the news media.

Sen. Judy Estenson, R-Warwick, said House members who amended the lunch funding into a larger bill were forcing the Senate to “swallow a bitter pill that we’ve taken a lot of heat for.”

The bill received no vocal resistance in the House on Friday, where representatives did not debate the lunch funding or any other piece of the proposal.

Rep. LaurieBeth Hager, a Fargo Democrat who sponsored the original lunch funding bill, told Forum News Service she is relieved that the $6 million appropriation made it through the Legislature, adding that she was stunned and saddened by the Republican pushback on the proposal.

Well-fed kids will learn better in school, and the state should pick up the tab for students’ meals as it does for other materials like desks and books, Hager said.

Nick Archuleta, president of teachers' union North Dakota United, said he's very happy with the Legislature's decision, noting that attendance at school is compulsory and children shouldn't be charged for lunch.

Hager and Archuleta said they hope to see the program expand in future years.",2023-04-28 22:04:22

How would today's modern EV's fare in North Dakota's cold winters?  What happens if one sits outside in sub zero degree temperatures for 8 hours while someone is at work or sits outside for a week?  (Not everyone has an insulated garage.)  Can you start one up at -10 degrees F without inflicting any damage on the batteries or the vehicle?

My wife is looking for a new vehicle and is a tad nervous driving in the winter because she went off the road last year in her AWD vehicle (From people I have talked to, this is just something that happens to a good portion of people out here) and I explain to her that it isn't too bad. I recommend to her that we replace her vehicle with something 4WD and learn to use it, but half of the people she knows swear by AWD, the other half tell her 4WD, clearance and knowing when to use the 4WD is better.. so pluses and minuses?

We love the cold so moving from 110 degrees to this has been great for us... but horrible for everything we own.",2024-01-13 07:54:05

I don't mind the cold - just wondering if I may be in over my head weather-wise or if it would just be more enjoyable to come next year?

2. Weather-wise, it looks like I may be coming in the week before it starts getting snowy. But from everything I've read, that's nothing to bank on. I'm not used to snow, but if I do come, is there anything (outside of clothing) that I should bring with me just in case?

So as a diversion and game we got an app called Plates.  Point is to find all 50 states license plates (doesn’t have DC poor little Columbia). 

So during our two week 2000 mile southern road trip we found like 40 plates (this included going to hotel parking lots  in Gatlinburg TN to find a bunch of odd ones like Oklahoma).  

Since then we have found 9 more (including that obscure one called Hawaii.  Long journey!). 

Down to one.  Yours!  We look high, we look low. Does the place actually exist?   I go to hertz and enterprise lots….a gold mine of non North Dakota plates.  

Listen, if one of you guys could come to Philly and drive around a bunch for like a month, I am sure I could finish the game!  Focus on Chester County. My daughter would be super grateful and it would answer the question my family has “are there really any North Dakotans”.

The UND campus is so pretty, everyone in Grand Forks is nice, downtown is so cute and fun… and the list goes on. I absolutely love it here (granted, I’ve been here a short time and haven’t experienced your infamous winters) and I love your community (again, granted I’ve been interacting mostly with people at UND.) There is so much to do around here - on and off campus. I do more here than I do in my home city, San Diego. Sorry if this is basically suggesting that I was expecting this state would be shit and boring. But I kinda did. But it’s not. ND is rad and you all make it so rad. I feel that I sound like a dumb city girl who glamorizes the city and is ignorant about places like this. Because I am/was!

BISMARCK — A proposal to provide free school meals to low-income K-12 students took the long road through the North Dakota Legislature, but the program won approval from lawmakers with the clock running out on their biennial session.

Both chambers of the Legislature voted by wide margins Friday, April 28, to pass Senate Bill 2284, a broad school funding proposal that contains $6 million to cover meal costs for students from low-income families over the next two-year budget cycle.

The bill now goes to Gov. Doug Burgum, whose spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A federal program already provides free meals to students from families making below 130% of the federal poverty level, so the state allocation would cover kids with family incomes between 130-200% of the poverty level.

That means families of four with incomes at or below $60,000 would qualify for the free lunch program in North Dakota, according to current poverty level income figures.

Last month, the Republican-led Senate killed a bill containing the free lunch funding by a one-vote margin. The GOP-run House, which had previously passed the lunch funding, then resurrected the $6 million appropriation by inserting it into Senate Bill 2284.

Several senators spoke against the lunch funding Friday, arguing that the issue of paying for low-income students’ meals had been twisted out of proportion by the news media.

Sen. Judy Estenson, R-Warwick, said House members who amended the lunch funding into a larger bill were forcing the Senate to “swallow a bitter pill that we’ve taken a lot of heat for.”

The bill received no vocal resistance in the House on Friday, where representatives did not debate the lunch funding or any other piece of the proposal.

Rep. LaurieBeth Hager, a Fargo Democrat who sponsored the original lunch funding bill, told Forum News Service she is relieved that the $6 million appropriation made it through the Legislature, adding that she was stunned and saddened by the Republican pushback on the proposal.

Well-fed kids will learn better in school, and the state should pick up the tab for students’ meals as it does for other materials like desks and books, Hager said.

Nick Archuleta, president of teachers' union North Dakota United, said he's very happy with the Legislature's decision, noting that attendance at school is compulsory and children shouldn't be charged for lunch.

Hager and Archuleta said they hope to see the program expand in future years.",2023-04-28 22:04:22
