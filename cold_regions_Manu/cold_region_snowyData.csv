1,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

2,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",Things to do around Anchorage in early April?,"Hi Alaskans, I read a few tourist websites( [https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/](https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/)) that recommend visiting Anchorage in March/April. I have never been to Alaska and I have been on the mid atlantic since forever. What are your remmendations for things to do around this time of year?

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

So i started looking online for weatherization strips i could use. no i do not want to order from amazon so that is removed from the list. i would rather order from a company located in alaska. ordering from a company in the same state should be quicker than ordering from out of state right? right. i already have a few orders thats taking a while to make it to the village. maybe i should just look in the bush mailer and see if there is anything there.",2023-11-22 21:00:53
5,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",Just paid a visit to your state and I'm wearing shorts,"Anchorage was what I pictured ""typical"" Alaska to be in summertime -- cool weather, need jacket and hoodie.

Then I went to Fairbanks and wow it's like 86 out here and I have to wear shorts!  As a Texan this shocked me.

I didnt have enough time to visit the far north.

At any rate, I absolutely love your state.  Alaska truly is the last frontier and it's beauty was far greater than I anticipated.  My closest experience to you guys was Colorado but I have to say that Alaska blows Colorado out of the water.  Dont take your state for granted guys, there is stunning beauty everywhere you look that makes all the other states very jealous!

6,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50

People are always out doing fun things outside when it’s not too windy, yet you still can be the only person you see for miles. Folks show up for community events.

9,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

My husband and I accepted great jobs in the Anchorage area and are moving up in August. 

I've been really excited about it, but now that we're getting close, we have had so many friends/family be super negative about it and then I also keep seeing posts here about how miserable and awful it is and I'm freaking out a bit. 

I know that it's dark/cold right now and has been for a few months and that the negativity is condensed because no one comes on the internet to say how okay and normal everything is going. 

Info about our situation:

-We've been up twice, late October and late November and loved the beauty and nature even though it was damp and we liked the friendly but kinda gritty/crusty/real vibe of the people we met. 

-The pay is great. We will have more than enough to cover the increased cost of living, rapidly pay off student loans, save up for a house, go on a sunny vacation or two in the winter and most importantly - leave if we hate it. 

-We are outdoorsy homebodies that like hiking, fishing and camping and recently picked up snowshoeing for a winter sport. We've lived all over the country, have snow driving experience, and the other jobs we were considering were actually way, way more rural even though they were in the lower 48. 

-Kinda freaked out by bears, earthquakes and avalanches but I'm sure we'll get over it.

13,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

14,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",Electric vs. GPS fences for dogs in Alaska,"I've got a small farm and a large livestock guardian dog who loves to run off the fox, coyotes, porcupines, moose, bears, all of it.  However, I live a few hundred yards from the highway, am on a river, and have the train tracks bordering one side of the property.  I NEED to keep the dog off the tracks.  We have a few acres so a buried fence wouldn't be the best option.  I'm also unsure of how they would work with deep snow.

Does anyone know if GPS collars work without direct supervision?   I have tried a Petsafe perimeter unit that works with a slightly customizable circumference but it did not help as our land is narrow not wide and allowed the tracks into the safezone.   I was also worried about the dog crossing the line, getting shocked, and not being able to come back without being shocked.  When he chases or tracks something, he goes wholeheartedly at fullspeed.  I currently have a Tractive collar that notifies my phone within two minutes when he goes out of my customized area, but I can't rely on it when I am not home and have been tying him up to be safe when I leave.  

Dogs get hit by the train all the time - they don't seem to realize that it's gonna kill them.  Does anyone have any recommendations to help me keep my animals alive?  Fences are out - the electric ones tangle up the moose and regular fences go under the snow.  He keeps the livestock protected and I'd like to protect him by keeping him from dangers that he doesn't realize are there.  I have the time and love to have training time with him, I just can't seem to get him to respect the boundaries of the property.  We walk the borders every day at least once, if not twice.

If you are that person, I would like to grab some advice if at all possible.

My February visit to Talkeetna is finally materializing and deposits/reservations are being made to cross some lifelong bucket list items off the list. I am a photographer, but won't pretend to have faced the weather or astral conditions I will be looking at in an Alaska winter (I'm mainly involved in concert photography and portraiture).

Outside of the standard ""you know your batteries aren't gonna last as long in the cold"" is there any specific gear or anything else advice I may not be thinking of while participating in extensive sledding, hiking and wandering, snow machining, and flight seeing from arctic-seasoned photographers?

*Also, for what it's worth, while I will certainly take some photos of the Northern Lights because I am there, I am not super into astrophotography, so I am less concerned with the Lights being the subject of photos, but definitely want to get them behind whatever my subject is when/if possible.*

***Gear specific stuff:***

*I am trying not to overpack for this trip, but I wanna make sure I capture some of this stuff and hopefully do the Northern Lights justice, if visible during my short trip. I'll be carrying my Canon r6 for anything important.. I assume a battery grip is ideal? I have two OEM batteries, but I think I may pick up a third emergency battery, or a handful of third parties.*

*Lens-wise I think I will probably bring with me a 24-105 f/4 for most everyday stuff, and pack a 70-200 f/2.8 with a 2x extender for the flightseeing, and then a nifty fifty and a 16mm f/2.8 since they are tiny, portable and faster than the zoom, so why not. I use a Godox V1 as my main flash and will be bringing that with an extra battery as some of the dog sledding will be at night too. In lieu of tripods,  I think I will pack two Joby GorillaPods.. one for the camera and one for the flash, since they are way more portable and I'll be able to secure them to weird stuff if need be.*

*I have a 15mm f/2.8 that I may throw in last second, and since if I am bringing all this stuff anyway, why not? Might make for a cool fisheye photo when dog sledding, I dunno.*",2024-11-14 19:47:24

17,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",A story of moving to Alaska,"For those thinking about moving to Alaska.  I got this years ago and I cleaned it up to post here. 

July 12: Moved to our new home in Alaska. It is so beautiful here. The mountains are so majestic. Can't hardly wait to see the snow covering them.

August 22:  Alaska is the most beautiful place on earth. The leaves are turning all colors with shades of red and orange. Went for a ride today through the beautiful mountains and saw two moose. They are truly magnificent. Hope it will snow soon. I love Alaska.

September 15: Moose season is almost over now. Cant imagine how anyone would want to kill such a beautiful creature. Hope it wil snow soon. I love Alaska.

October 28: It snowed last night. Woke up with everything blanketed in white. It looks like a postcard. We went outside and cleaned the snow off the steps and took turns shoveling the driveway. We had a snowball fight (I won), and when the snowplow came by, we had to shovel the driveway again. What a beautiful place. I think I'll live here for ever.

November 5th: More snow last night. Ilove it! The snow plow came by again. I love it here.

December 27: 20 below zero is not nearly as cold as most people think. Had the car towed into a garage to thaw out; must have had an old battery. Took a cab to work.

January 4: More of the white crap fell last night. I've got blisters on my hands from shoveling. I think the snow plow hides around the comer and waits until I'm done shoveling the driveway. Butthead!

Jan 22: More fricking snow. If lever get my hands on that SOB who drives that snow plow I will rip his testicles off. Dont know why they don't put more gravel on the fricken roads.

Feb 1: More white crap. Been inside for three days except for shoveling out of the driveway after that plow goes through every time. Can't go anywhere, car's stuck in a mountain of white crap. The weatherman says to expect another 10 inches of crap tonight. Do you know how many shovels full of snow that is?

Feb 16: The fricken weatherman was wrong. We got 34 inches of the white crap yesterday. At this rate it wont melt before summer. The snow plow got stuck today. The SOB came to the door to ask if he could borrow my snow shovel. After I told him I had broken six shovels already shoveling all the crap he piled into my driveway, I broke my last one over his fricken skull.

March: 2 Finally got out of the house today. Went to the store to get some food and on the way back a stupid fricken moose ran out in front of my car and I hit him. Did about $6,000.00 damage to the car. Those fricken beasts should be killed. Wish a hunter had killed them all last summer.

19,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",Alaska without a car,"Hello y’all! I’m planning a trip to Alaska to see the northern lights + and I’d love to know experiences of whoever did this trip without a car. Im a backpacker and never rent a cat, so I’m familiar with the prices of cabs such uber/Lyft and the delays of public transportation. Also I don’t even know how to drive on snow, and I don’t think Alaska would be the place to practice. I wanna see the lights, go to North Pole, hot springs, dog sleigh rides etc. touristic stuff.

Are there ways to go around without a car? There are shuffles to those places? People you can hire to drive you around? 

I wanna hear from tourists and also locals!

20,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",I took a seasonal job in Seward this summer.,"I will be starting seasonal work in Seward this summer. I am beyond excited. I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).


Thank you in advanced 💜",2024-03-08 04:51:16

I love the small town feel of the valley while still having access to decent amenities. 

I can’t do big cities and spend an hour in traffic every day. 

I would like a location with no more than 4 months of snow, rain, or ice seasons. 

But not regular temperatures over 90.

22,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

24,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
25,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",Why did you move to Alaska?,"Question for people who have moved from Chicago, Detroit, Toronto or New York City, etc to Alaska.

Share your experiences from anything you noticed was different from weather, accents, food, etc.",2024-02-20 08:43:10
26,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",Becoming a Bush Pilot ,"Hey y'all, my name is Spencer and for a long time I've had this need to go and live in Alaska, I'm a welder and have other limited experiences with car work, plumbing, outdoors skills, hunting, fishing, and kayaking. I have been doing as much research as I can online about what would be the best path for me to take to become a Bush Pilot in God's country. Should I do my flight school here in Central VA or move to Anchorage or Fairbanks, get a welding job and take flight school there since I'll be more adjusted to the weather Alaska will have to offer during my training? I want to be apart of this community, it can sound campy and probably just spew from someone who's young and dumb (I'm 25 as of posting this) but the allure of being someone that can take hunters, researchers, hikers, campers, and guides out to difficult spots and to assist in bringing supplies to communities, helping others out, being apart of something great is constantly drumming at my soul. I am at a stage of analysis paralysis and there's contradictory information out there on which is the best path. I don't want to take a lazy route, I want to earn this and be great to myself and others, I just want to know the best way to go about it. 

Thank you for y'alls time and I hope I got the wording of this out. If it helps any extra on where I'd like to make a more permanent living, the south east to south central parts of the state is what's attractive to me as a place for home but that can change once in the motion and falling in love with another spot. 

Again thank you all for your time!",2024-04-28 20:59:03

I just got a gig bartending up in Healy for the Summer season and I don't really know what to expect. I'm excited but I don't know anyone who has done anything like this. Living in California currently. I'll be arriving in Anchorage a few days early and doing some shopping at Costco, and some other stores if you guys have any recommendations.

**Anything I should buy here specifically before I leave?**

**What should I bring that I probably am not thinking about?**

**Is it ever shorts/ flipflop weather up there?**

**To anyone that's done this, or something similar, what's the crowd like? How's day to day?**

29,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

30,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",Moving (To AK) Logistics and Scouting Trip,"Hello everyone. My wife and I are on the precipice of moving to AK shortly. She has several offers in the works that we are considering, and so we're near go time. I have a couple of questions that I'd like some opinions on here:

1) I'm looking at the most economical way for us to move up there. I know it's going to be expensive, which is fine...but I'd rather it's not any more expensive than it has to be. The area we are likely to end up in is Glennallen, and we'll be moving from eastern Oregon. What's the best way to get our crap up there? 3 bedroom house and some tools.

2) As part of all of this (and as we had planned prior to the offers being received) I am going to be driving up there in about a month and then picking up my wife in Anchorage and doing a big loop that will include the three locations we'd most likely move to (Anchorage, Fairbanks and Glennallen). This will give us some boots-on-ground sense of what we're getting into, and help at least initially identify some areas we'd like to live in. My question here is: are there any particular things you think I should look for to help us get the best sense of the areas while we're up there?

3) Finally...my wife hasn't been to AK, I've spent time out on Kodiak, and we've both lived above 7200ft in Colorado (10ft snow, below zero winter temps, 40+ miles to closest town) and in the mountains in Montana, and feel confident in our reasons for moving up there. That being said, we're also trying to really look at the pros and cons of the Glennallen are...so input on that is also welcome. I saw another thread that talked a little about this, but I welcome more input. Probably our biggest motivator is the natural environment around us...so if you have any practical experience with outdoor stuff in the Glennallen region, I'd love to hear it. Comparisons between the three areas for outdoor access/use/coolness is also welcome.

Thanks in advance to those of you who weigh in on this! ",2023-06-24 17:41:55

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

**UPDATE JULY '24**

Loved it, going back in the winter. Place is a blast. Make friends in the community and it makes all the difference. Cannot wait.",2024-03-25 15:15:33
33,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Location: Eagle Summit, Steese Hwy  
Type: Death Investigation  
Dispatch Text:

On January 3, 2024, at 5:54 pm, the Alaska State Troopers received a report that two adults had not arrived in Circle after departing Fairbanks earlier in the day. The two had reportedly left in a vehicle on January 2, 2024. The vehicle had been spotted stuck in snow at Eagle Summit on the Steese Highway earlier in the day, however, the person that spotted the vehicle was unable to stop to check on the vehicle due to extreme weather conditions in the area. With the assistance of a DOT&PF crew, an Alaska State Trooper responded to Eagle Summit and located the vehicle on the evening of January 3rd. There were whiteout and blizzard conditions in the pass when the trooper and DOT&PF crew located the vehicle - winds were gusting to 60 miles per hour, and there were 10' drifts on the roadway. The Trooper broke the window on the vehicle and located the missing adults, both deceased, inside the vehicle. The extreme weather conditions prevented the Trooper from safely recovering the bodies, so the vehicle was secured until they could safely be recovered. Two other vehicles were assisted by DOT&PF crews that had run out of fuel or become stuck on the Steese Highway on January 3rd. On January 5, 2024, weather conditions improved, allowing a DOT&PF crew, Troopers, and a tow truck to recover the vehicle and the bodies safely. Both bodies and the vehicle were transported back to Fairbanks for positive identification and further investigation. They will both be sent to the State Medical Examiner’s Office for autopsy. No foul play is suspected at this time. The identities of the deceased will be released pending positive identification and next of kin notifications.

35,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",Visit Alaska during the Christmas season,"Hi alaskans! I am probably a madman but I am planning a very impromptu late december /January solo trip to alaska hoping to see the northern light and experience the winter landscape/nature.

I have researched a bit on this and my understanding is I would need to go to Fairbank and skip Anchorage if my focus is on nature and northern light. And need to consider

Pros:

- winter months have more night time and less light pollution, less cloudy than rekjavik, great chance seeing northern light, I read that sunset starts at 3:30pm.

- a lot of winter activities

- less tourists? 

Cons: 

- -40 F weather
- most touristy things are closed, denali road closure at Mile 3.
- animal sighting will be scarce

As someone who’s furtherst winter destination was New Hampshire, I just don’t have any idea as to how cold -40 is. Is it even possible to drink water outside? Is following a group absolutely necessary?

Also just how much stuff are open during Christmas? Can I see anything besides trees at all via cars(I searched some photos of fairbank in winter and it looks just like trees on snows)? And would I need to hike miles just to get to the edge of any meaningful landscape? 

If you would not recommend alaska in december/January, where would you recommend me go instead? I searched about yellowstones but seems like most of the roads there will be closed too, but probably will have a more tolerable weather than fairbanks

I was looking at housing in Palmer, Butte, and possibly as far south as Eagle River (but I don't know if the commute to Palmer is doable in the winter from there).  


I'm moving from the Dallas, TX area - so obviously, culture and environment shock. Originally I'm from a rural southern town though, so familiar with small town politics / community, having to hop in a car to go 15-20 minutes for groceries etc. I know that the winters are long and cold, and that summers are beautiful. I was in the Anchorage / Seward / Knik Glacier last summer, and it was obviously amazing in the summer. I know that glacier silt in the Mat-Su valley is a thing.

I have a young family of 5 (ages 5 thru 12), so I know getting plugged into a community quickly will be very important; but what are some other considerations for the area? Is Alaska, and this area, a good place to raise a family? We homeschool already, and generally have pretty conservative values, so is that a good fit for the area? Important question - Does Amazon ship there? :) 

From a 'being independent' perspective - what all would need to be purchased prior to moving to Alaska to be prepared for the environment: snow blower? Tire chains? We've all got decent cold weather gear from skiing, outdoor gear from family camping trips, firearms from years of hunting... but are there other major items you have to aquire to make it there?

48,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",Cost to Live in Alaska,"Hey y'all. Kids and I are moving to Alaska this spring after the house sales. I've always wanted to move there since I was a kid reading Balto, Julie of the Wolves, Hatchet, My Side of the Mountain, and Island of the Blue Dolphins (know some aren't about Alaska but it's always reminded me of it for some reason).  The kids want to move also so we are all on board.

We've been redoing the house with lots of sweat equity so it sells better/for more. Getting the trucks (all 4wd)  rock solid and replacing everything on them. We've been downsizing and focusing on keeping tools and other needs vs stuff/wants/furniture. Ive homeschooled all the kids so lots of stuff. Researching by watching every YouTube homestead/fish/hunt/family video I can find, asking questions, taking notes and even watching Alaskan Costco and Grocery Hauls to see how the cost of groceries compare.

We are gardeners/farmers/homesteaders and the kids are 15-24 yrs old. Kids have grown up farming; garden, meat rabbits, pigs, dairy goats, chickens, ducks, quail, turkeys and we process our own meat as well as can; PC & WB, ferment, bake bread, make cheese, and dehydrate.

We don't like living here in TN at all. We moved here 4 years ago, after my husband passed away and I lost our farm in Ohio. I've a mortgage with a low interest rate on 3 acres here in TN.  We raise most all our food. We can afford living here but we are so unhappy and simply don't fit in here. 

 Kids can't afford to live on their own working full time    and  they want to find partners someday who work as hard as they do. I don't blame them as it's hard to find anyone with a good work ethic or people who are willing to work things out in a relationship based on what I've seen.. They were raised not to settle for red 
 flags and that relationships don't just happen...they're a give and take and no one should keep score. 

Lol, I know I sound like, ""I'm not like other girls."" right now. 

I work from home and that makes nearly all my income. The farm brings in the extra we need. I can continue working from home when we move to Alaska as long as I've internet. 

I know we will take a hit with the farm income/ animals since everyone gardens up there and there is a short season and we will not be set up the first year and will be starting over and just handling  infrastructure so to speak. We are canning up any extra veggies to  help counter that financial hit while we get established. We will be bringing some livestock babies with us; piglets, meat rabbits, Icelandics, and  quail. We are converting a trailer so they'll have housing when we get there we don't have to build and bringing our portable solar fencing with us for runs until we get a permanent space for them.

My oldest has a ""good job"" here working 12-14 hr days 6 days a week at $12 and he can just now afford an apartment and utilities on his own...as long as he was to eat ramen and doesn't meet someone. So he still lives at home and he is how we are affording to remodel the house.  I also grew up doing this so while no expert I was raised by parents who were/are and I can do enough diy to stay out of trouble.

We plan on building a small home/cabin on a few acres when we move up to Alaska. Our old farm was a tiny house on solar (but my husband who passed set it up so I'm not confident'going off grid' without a backup plan) and we had rainwater catchment as well as a spring fed pond for watering the animals. We also had a composting toilet. Ohio gets down to -10 but doesn't have the amount of snow AK does nor the constant negative temps. Ohio has a ton of humidity though and folks keep telling me Alaska is a dry snow so you don't get wet so I've my doubts about this information.  I keep thinking a freezer is dry inside but you'll still freeze to death locked in it even with your coveralls.

We also heated with wood. Bub and Sexy Beast of a Hubby cut it for us. Girls and I are not well versed on chopping wood but aren't afraid to learn. We did stack well though lol. I've also bought safety gear, a chainsaw light enough for me/the girls a big one for my moose of a son.  Figure a log splitter will equalize us in who can split wood.

I  read an article about evictions, folks not able to feed their family, cost of food has doubled and I'm having a slight panic attack and need your knowledge and experience. 

I put in our income in a cost of living and it said in order to maintain our current lifestyle (which is a very diy/self sufficient) we would need to earn an extra 35k a year!

How much are your utilities? What is the cost per kilowatt(?). How.much is water? How many in your family? How many cords per year for how many sq feet? How much is a cord of seasomed wood ( will need a years worth off the bat since wood we'd get would be wet). How much are groceries and how much of your own food do you grow/raise/harvest?

I want to connect to the grid and be on the road system cause I want to make sure we don't freeze to death or die in a snow drift and electric is not my most comfortable thing to work with plus winter means we'd still be running a generator so...maybe later once we're not building the property.
We do not have any friends here (being a widow tends to freak people out that it's contagious or they think yosomesomeu want their janky husband...heifer I had a King and this Queen doesn't settle for junk.) bit are working to build community.  We left Ohio mainly due to extended family that we have 0 contact with. 

Kids and I are on our own in every way and we are ok with that but they want healthy supportive partners  and we would love to  have friends that like bonfires, grilling out, see value in a stocked pantry, will trade you some time processing chickens or pigs for chickens or pork, don't only do things that require $ (like don't kids hike anymore? When did a date have to be an expensive restaurant? Picnics rock and it doesn't require going broke. And never hear....""Why don't you just buy meat from the grocery store?""

Am I being paranoid or is this a dream we need to put on hold longer, save up more (money from house selling is what/how we will buy land & materials up there)? I am a worrier and house goes up this spring. I get it could be cold feet but we are talking moving everything almost 5000 miles over 12 days.

53,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24

My husband and I accepted great jobs in the Anchorage area and are moving up in August. 

I've been really excited about it, but now that we're getting close, we have had so many friends/family be super negative about it and then I also keep seeing posts here about how miserable and awful it is and I'm freaking out a bit. 

I know that it's dark/cold right now and has been for a few months and that the negativity is condensed because no one comes on the internet to say how okay and normal everything is going. 

Info about our situation:

-We've been up twice, late October and late November and loved the beauty and nature even though it was damp and we liked the friendly but kinda gritty/crusty/real vibe of the people we met. 

-The pay is great. We will have more than enough to cover the increased cost of living, rapidly pay off student loans, save up for a house, go on a sunny vacation or two in the winter and most importantly - leave if we hate it. 

-We are outdoorsy homebodies that like hiking, fishing and camping and recently picked up snowshoeing for a winter sport. We've lived all over the country, have snow driving experience, and the other jobs we were considering were actually way, way more rural even though they were in the lower 48. 

-Kinda freaked out by bears, earthquakes and avalanches but I'm sure we'll get over it.

Anyways, thank you for reading my crazy rambling and please tell me it will all be okay :)",2023-03-08 04:26:24

I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

(a reach),"Like a dumb dummy, I forgot to save the thread I was reading (either on here or r/skAlaska) a month or so ago about god knows what- where a photographer in Alaska with extensive experience shooting in abject freezing temperatures was dropping some great advice, and invited OP to message them privately to discuss further. If you are that person, I would like to grab some advice if at all possible.

My February visit to Talkeetna is finally materializing and deposits/reservations are being made to cross some lifelong bucket list items off the list. I am a photographer, but won't pretend to have faced the weather or astral conditions I will be looking at in an Alaska winter (I'm mainly involved in concert photography and portraiture).

Outside of the standard ""you know your batteries aren't gonna last as long in the cold"" is there any specific gear or anything else advice I may not be thinking of while participating in extensive sledding, hiking and wandering, snow machining, and flight seeing from arctic-seasoned photographers?

*Also, for what it's worth, while I will certainly take some photos of the Northern Lights because I am there, I am not super into astrophotography, so I am less concerned with the Lights being the subject of photos, but definitely want to get them behind whatever my subject is when/if possible.*

***Gear specific stuff:***

*I am trying not to overpack for this trip, but I wanna make sure I capture some of this stuff and hopefully do the Northern Lights justice, if visible during my short trip. I'll be carrying my Canon r6 for anything important.. I assume a battery grip is ideal? I have two OEM batteries, but I think I may pick up a third emergency battery, or a handful of third parties.*

*Lens-wise I think I will probably bring with me a 24-105 f/4 for most everyday stuff, and pack a 70-200 f/2.8 with a 2x extender for the flightseeing, and then a nifty fifty and a 16mm f/2.8 since they are tiny, portable and faster than the zoom, so why not. I use a Godox V1 as my main flash and will be bringing that with an extra battery as some of the dog sledding will be at night too. In lieu of tripods,  I think I will pack two Joby GorillaPods.. one for the camera and one for the flash, since they are way more portable and I'll be able to secure them to weird stuff if need be.*

*I have a 15mm f/2.8 that I may throw in last second, and since if I am bringing all this stuff anyway, why not? Might make for a cool fisheye photo when dog sledding, I dunno.*",2024-11-14 19:47:24

64,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, hate",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

65,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, hate","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Location: Eagle Summit, Steese Hwy  
Type: Death Investigation  
Dispatch Text:

On January 3, 2024, at 5:54 pm, the Alaska State Troopers received a report that two adults had not arrived in Circle after departing Fairbanks earlier in the day. The two had reportedly left in a vehicle on January 2, 2024. The vehicle had been spotted stuck in snow at Eagle Summit on the Steese Highway earlier in the day, however, the person that spotted the vehicle was unable to stop to check on the vehicle due to extreme weather conditions in the area. With the assistance of a DOT&PF crew, an Alaska State Trooper responded to Eagle Summit and located the vehicle on the evening of January 3rd. There were whiteout and blizzard conditions in the pass when the trooper and DOT&PF crew located the vehicle - winds were gusting to 60 miles per hour, and there were 10' drifts on the roadway. The Trooper broke the window on the vehicle and located the missing adults, both deceased, inside the vehicle. The extreme weather conditions prevented the Trooper from safely recovering the bodies, so the vehicle was secured until they could safely be recovered. Two other vehicles were assisted by DOT&PF crews that had run out of fuel or become stuck on the Steese Highway on January 3rd. On January 5, 2024, weather conditions improved, allowing a DOT&PF crew, Troopers, and a tow truck to recover the vehicle and the bodies safely. Both bodies and the vehicle were transported back to Fairbanks for positive identification and further investigation. They will both be sent to the State Medical Examiner’s Office for autopsy. No foul play is suspected at this time. The identities of the deceased will be released pending positive identification and next of kin notifications.

67,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, hate",Visit Alaska during the Christmas season,"Hi alaskans! I am probably a madman but I am planning a very impromptu late december /January solo trip to alaska hoping to see the northern light and experience the winter landscape/nature.

I have researched a bit on this and my understanding is I would need to go to Fairbank and skip Anchorage if my focus is on nature and northern light. And need to consider

Pros:

- winter months have more night time and less light pollution, less cloudy than rekjavik, great chance seeing northern light, I read that sunset starts at 3:30pm.

- a lot of winter activities

- less tourists? 

Cons: 

- -40 F weather
- most touristy things are closed, denali road closure at Mile 3.
- animal sighting will be scarce

As someone who’s furtherst winter destination was New Hampshire, I just don’t have any idea as to how cold -40 is. Is it even possible to drink water outside? Is following a group absolutely necessary?

Also just how much stuff are open during Christmas? Can I see anything besides trees at all via cars(I searched some photos of fairbank in winter and it looks just like trees on snows)? And would I need to hike miles just to get to the edge of any meaningful landscape? 

If you would not recommend alaska in december/January, where would you recommend me go instead? I searched about yellowstones but seems like most of the roads there will be closed too, but probably will have a more tolerable weather than fairbanks

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice?

77,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, hate",Tips for driving in hazardous conditions.,"On the way into to town I passed 3 accidents. One of them involving around 6 cars, and busted up guardrails. 
You can avoid wrecking your and other peoples vehicals and putting other folks lives in danger by following a few tips. 
Tip 1, identify the hazardous condition. Some folks will not be able to do this until they are on the road, but there is actually a better way. If it warms up enough for stuff to thaw, and then gets cold again enough to freeze, then a light dusting of snow will make the road really slick.
Tip 2, leave early.
Tip 3, slow down.
Tip 4, feel free to let the other drivers on the road know that there is a hazard ahead by using your hazard lights. 
Tip 5, stay in one lane. Changing lanes tends to kick up the snow on the road, and blind the drivers behind you. Now it's clear that some people do not care, and just want to get to their destination as fast as possible. You do not have to care about what they want. On days like today, it is actually perfectly acceptable to drive slow in the left lane. 
Each of these accidents had officers on the road attending them. I would hate to have their job on a day like today. ",2024-02-25 00:10:37

First off, thank you ALL for such thoughtful and detailed responses!  

After taking all of the previous recommendations into consideration, we have officially changed our plans and will be focussing on only visiting Denali, rather than attempting to visit the additional 2 National Parks.

&#x200B;

The current plan is:  
Flying into Anchorage late Friday, 11/3 and staying by the airport.

11/4 - Renting car in Anchorage and driving to stay near Denali National Park.

11/5 - Exploring Denali (staying near Denali National Park)

11/6 - Drive somewhere more north (possibly Nenana or SUGGESTIONS???  to potentially see the northern lights (spend night here)

11/7 - Drive back to and stay in Anchorage

11/8 - Drive to and explore Seward (staying in Seward)

11/9 - Driving back to Anchorage

Does this seem slightly more realistic compared to my Original Post?  Of course, we could get snowed in on our first night and none of this happens, but if we get a little cooperation from the weather, are there any reasons to think this couldn't be doable?

Does anyone have a suggestion for possible northern lights viewing (I have no idea if Nenana would actually be a good place??)

&#x200B;

Again, many thanks to everyone that took the time and effort to really assist with this!  I left the original post below:

&#x200B;

(OP)

I'm going to be in Anchorage, AK for a conference in November and was hoping to utilize the trip to knock out some National Parks, but need some guidance and suggestions from people with more information than me!

Having never been to Alaska, especially not in the winter, I really do not know what to expect or how to properly plan (or what is even possible).

My hope is fly into Anchorage on 11/3, rent a properly winterized 4x4 vehicle and visit Denali, Kenai Fjords & Wrangell-St. Elias from 11/4-11/9 , returning to Anchorage on 11/9.  I will say that I am NOT looking to camp at the parks during this time!  Instead focussing on the scenic views of the National Parks (and potential wildlife) while officially check them off of my ""National Parks Visited"" list.

&#x200B;

I do not know when I will be back in Alaska in the future and really want to potentially visit all three of the driveable National Parks near Anchorage.  Is it manageable to essentially visit one park every two days?

&#x200B;

My initial question for anyone with winter Alaska experience is, is this even possible from a driving perspective?  Between the lack of light and winter driving conditions, am I over estimating what can be done?  Anyone with winter driving experience in Alaska that can give suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

&#x200B;

If I am overestimating, please give some suggestions with what I could possibly change.

I have never been to Alaska and I have been on the mid atlantic since forever. What are your remmendations for things to do around this time of year?

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

88,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, enjoy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24

I think I’m pretty suited for cold weather.  Last year I endured a record breaking almost 9 feet of snow. What temperatures should I be expecting?,2023-11-04 06:26:38
91,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

92,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, enjoy",Cold weather photographers? (a reach),"Like a dumb dummy, I forgot to save the thread I was reading (either on here or r/skAlaska) a month or so ago about god knows what- where a photographer in Alaska with extensive experience shooting in abject freezing temperatures was dropping some great advice, and invited OP to message them privately to discuss further. If you are that person, I would like to grab some advice if at all possible.

My February visit to Talkeetna is finally materializing and deposits/reservations are being made to cross some lifelong bucket list items off the list. I am a photographer, but won't pretend to have faced the weather or astral conditions I will be looking at in an Alaska winter (I'm mainly involved in concert photography and portraiture).

Outside of the standard ""you know your batteries aren't gonna last as long in the cold"" is there any specific gear or anything else advice I may not be thinking of while participating in extensive sledding, hiking and wandering, snow machining, and flight seeing from arctic-seasoned photographers?

*Also, for what it's worth, while I will certainly take some photos of the Northern Lights because I am there, I am not super into astrophotography, so I am less concerned with the Lights being the subject of photos, but definitely want to get them behind whatever my subject is when/if possible.*

***Gear specific stuff:***

*I am trying not to overpack for this trip, but I wanna make sure I capture some of this stuff and hopefully do the Northern Lights justice, if visible during my short trip. I'll be carrying my Canon r6 for anything important.. I assume a battery grip is ideal? I have two OEM batteries, but I think I may pick up a third emergency battery, or a handful of third parties.*

*Lens-wise I think I will probably bring with me a 24-105 f/4 for most everyday stuff, and pack a 70-200 f/2.8 with a 2x extender for the flightseeing, and then a nifty fifty and a 16mm f/2.8 since they are tiny, portable and faster than the zoom, so why not. I use a Godox V1 as my main flash and will be bringing that with an extra battery as some of the dog sledding will be at night too. In lieu of tripods,  I think I will pack two Joby GorillaPods.. one for the camera and one for the flash, since they are way more portable and I'll be able to secure them to weird stuff if need be.*

*I have a 15mm f/2.8 that I may throw in last second, and since if I am bringing all this stuff anyway, why not? Might make for a cool fisheye photo when dog sledding, I dunno.*",2024-11-14 19:47:24

94,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, enjoy",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

97,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, enjoy",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

98,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, enjoy","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Location: Eagle Summit, Steese Hwy  
Type: Death Investigation  
Dispatch Text:

On January 3, 2024, at 5:54 pm, the Alaska State Troopers received a report that two adults had not arrived in Circle after departing Fairbanks earlier in the day. The two had reportedly left in a vehicle on January 2, 2024. The vehicle had been spotted stuck in snow at Eagle Summit on the Steese Highway earlier in the day, however, the person that spotted the vehicle was unable to stop to check on the vehicle due to extreme weather conditions in the area. With the assistance of a DOT&PF crew, an Alaska State Trooper responded to Eagle Summit and located the vehicle on the evening of January 3rd. There were whiteout and blizzard conditions in the pass when the trooper and DOT&PF crew located the vehicle - winds were gusting to 60 miles per hour, and there were 10' drifts on the roadway. The Trooper broke the window on the vehicle and located the missing adults, both deceased, inside the vehicle. The extreme weather conditions prevented the Trooper from safely recovering the bodies, so the vehicle was secured until they could safely be recovered. Two other vehicles were assisted by DOT&PF crews that had run out of fuel or become stuck on the Steese Highway on January 3rd. On January 5, 2024, weather conditions improved, allowing a DOT&PF crew, Troopers, and a tow truck to recover the vehicle and the bodies safely. Both bodies and the vehicle were transported back to Fairbanks for positive identification and further investigation. They will both be sent to the State Medical Examiner’s Office for autopsy. No foul play is suspected at this time. The identities of the deceased will be released pending positive identification and next of kin notifications.

100,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, enjoy",Visit Alaska during the Christmas season,"Hi alaskans! I am probably a madman but I am planning a very impromptu late december /January solo trip to alaska hoping to see the northern light and experience the winter landscape/nature.

I have researched a bit on this and my understanding is I would need to go to Fairbank and skip Anchorage if my focus is on nature and northern light. And need to consider

Pros:

- winter months have more night time and less light pollution, less cloudy than rekjavik, great chance seeing northern light, I read that sunset starts at 3:30pm.

- a lot of winter activities

- less tourists? 

Cons: 

- -40 F weather
- most touristy things are closed, denali road closure at Mile 3.
- animal sighting will be scarce

As someone who’s furtherst winter destination was New Hampshire, I just don’t have any idea as to how cold -40 is. Is it even possible to drink water outside? Is following a group absolutely necessary?

Also just how much stuff are open during Christmas? Can I see anything besides trees at all via cars(I searched some photos of fairbank in winter and it looks just like trees on snows)? And would I need to hike miles just to get to the edge of any meaningful landscape? 

If you would not recommend alaska in december/January, where would you recommend me go instead? I searched about yellowstones but seems like most of the roads there will be closed too, but probably will have a more tolerable weather than fairbanks

First off, thank you ALL for such thoughtful and detailed responses!  

After taking all of the previous recommendations into consideration, we have officially changed our plans and will be focussing on only visiting Denali, rather than attempting to visit the additional 2 National Parks.

&#x200B;

The current plan is:  
Flying into Anchorage late Friday, 11/3 and staying by the airport.

11/4 - Renting car in Anchorage and driving to stay near Denali National Park.

11/5 - Exploring Denali (staying near Denali National Park)

11/6 - Drive somewhere more north (possibly Nenana or SUGGESTIONS???  to potentially see the northern lights (spend night here)

11/7 - Drive back to and stay in Anchorage

11/8 - Drive to and explore Seward (staying in Seward)

11/9 - Driving back to Anchorage

Does this seem slightly more realistic compared to my Original Post?  Of course, we could get snowed in on our first night and none of this happens, but if we get a little cooperation from the weather, are there any reasons to think this couldn't be doable?

Does anyone have a suggestion for possible northern lights viewing (I have no idea if Nenana would actually be a good place??)

&#x200B;

Again, many thanks to everyone that took the time and effort to really assist with this!  I left the original post below:

&#x200B;

(OP)

I'm going to be in Anchorage, AK for a conference in November and was hoping to utilize the trip to knock out some National Parks, but need some guidance and suggestions from people with more information than me!

Having never been to Alaska, especially not in the winter, I really do not know what to expect or how to properly plan (or what is even possible).

My hope is fly into Anchorage on 11/3, rent a properly winterized 4x4 vehicle and visit Denali, Kenai Fjords & Wrangell-St. Elias from 11/4-11/9 , returning to Anchorage on 11/9.  I will say that I am NOT looking to camp at the parks during this time!  Instead focussing on the scenic views of the National Parks (and potential wildlife) while officially check them off of my ""National Parks Visited"" list.

&#x200B;

I do not know when I will be back in Alaska in the future and really want to potentially visit all three of the driveable National Parks near Anchorage.  Is it manageable to essentially visit one park every two days?

&#x200B;

My initial question for anyone with winter Alaska experience is, is this even possible from a driving perspective?  Between the lack of light and winter driving conditions, am I over estimating what can be done?  Anyone with winter driving experience in Alaska that can give suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

&#x200B;

2. If the shuttle is the only possibility, would it still be worth renting a car a trying to drive part of the route to Seward for the views? Or a different location to drive to?

3. Is the Aurora winter train trip worth taking from Anchorage to Fairbanks in mid April as the days are already quite long and chances of spotting the lights is low. I.e. are the views on that route worth it? (>$200pp one way is a hefty amount) I understand on a good day you can see mount Denali from the train..is this also possible from the road if we were to rent a car?

2.) Our general itinerary would be to fly to Anchorage, then drive to Denali, and then down to the Seward/Homer area. But it sounds like 1 week is not enough time to really do those places justice so we may have to end up cutting out Denali for the below reasons.

We are torn between Denali and the Kenai Peninsula. On one hand, everyone talks about Denali but we saw that there is a landslide that severely limits ground transportation in the area. We mulled over a flight tour but some have pointed out that this summer, rain and fog have made them 50/50 shots. Kenai sounds/looks amazing but compared to some of the bigger sites in Alaska, I haven't heard much about it.

3) I've always wanted to hike on a glacier and was curious as to recommendations on what would be a good one that doesn't take all day. I've heard good things about the Byron, Portage, and Matanuska glaciers that seem to be all a relatively short driving distance from Anchorage.

4) Are snow mobile/ATV tours worth it? They are heavily marketed on some sites.

116,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, enjoy",Alaska in August/September 2024,"Hello!

So I'm planning a trip to alaska in August or September(After school starts to avoid the crowd). Some of the things I wanna do include a glacier landing, fjords, Denali. Would ideally fly into Anchorage. Wondering how the weather is and how the roads would be, and how far ahead do I need to book some of those Denali tours that go within the park? I don't mind the cold but hesitant about driving when its snowing. TIA",2023-10-26 14:37:29

I have never been to Alaska and I have been on the mid atlantic since forever. What are your remmendations for things to do around this time of year?

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

118,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, enjoy",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

119,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, enjoy","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

124,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, dislike",Cold weather photographers? (a reach),"Like a dumb dummy, I forgot to save the thread I was reading (either on here or r/skAlaska) a month or so ago about god knows what- where a photographer in Alaska with extensive experience shooting in abject freezing temperatures was dropping some great advice, and invited OP to message them privately to discuss further. If you are that person, I would like to grab some advice if at all possible.

My February visit to Talkeetna is finally materializing and deposits/reservations are being made to cross some lifelong bucket list items off the list. I am a photographer, but won't pretend to have faced the weather or astral conditions I will be looking at in an Alaska winter (I'm mainly involved in concert photography and portraiture).

Outside of the standard ""you know your batteries aren't gonna last as long in the cold"" is there any specific gear or anything else advice I may not be thinking of while participating in extensive sledding, hiking and wandering, snow machining, and flight seeing from arctic-seasoned photographers?

*Also, for what it's worth, while I will certainly take some photos of the Northern Lights because I am there, I am not super into astrophotography, so I am less concerned with the Lights being the subject of photos, but definitely want to get them behind whatever my subject is when/if possible.*

***Gear specific stuff:***

*I am trying not to overpack for this trip, but I wanna make sure I capture some of this stuff and hopefully do the Northern Lights justice, if visible during my short trip. I'll be carrying my Canon r6 for anything important.. I assume a battery grip is ideal? I have two OEM batteries, but I think I may pick up a third emergency battery, or a handful of third parties.*

*Lens-wise I think I will probably bring with me a 24-105 f/4 for most everyday stuff, and pack a 70-200 f/2.8 with a 2x extender for the flightseeing, and then a nifty fifty and a 16mm f/2.8 since they are tiny, portable and faster than the zoom, so why not. I use a Godox V1 as my main flash and will be bringing that with an extra battery as some of the dog sledding will be at night too. In lieu of tripods,  I think I will pack two Joby GorillaPods.. one for the camera and one for the flash, since they are way more portable and I'll be able to secure them to weird stuff if need be.*

*I have a 15mm f/2.8 that I may throw in last second, and since if I am bringing all this stuff anyway, why not? Might make for a cool fisheye photo when dog sledding, I dunno.*",2024-11-14 19:47:24

126,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, dislike",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24

128,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, dislike",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

129,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, dislike","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Type: Death Investigation  
Dispatch Text:

On January 3, 2024, at 5:54 pm, the Alaska State Troopers received a report that two adults had not arrived in Circle after departing Fairbanks earlier in the day. The two had reportedly left in a vehicle on January 2, 2024. The vehicle had been spotted stuck in snow at Eagle Summit on the Steese Highway earlier in the day, however, the person that spotted the vehicle was unable to stop to check on the vehicle due to extreme weather conditions in the area. With the assistance of a DOT&PF crew, an Alaska State Trooper responded to Eagle Summit and located the vehicle on the evening of January 3rd. There were whiteout and blizzard conditions in the pass when the trooper and DOT&PF crew located the vehicle - winds were gusting to 60 miles per hour, and there were 10' drifts on the roadway. The Trooper broke the window on the vehicle and located the missing adults, both deceased, inside the vehicle. The extreme weather conditions prevented the Trooper from safely recovering the bodies, so the vehicle was secured until they could safely be recovered. Two other vehicles were assisted by DOT&PF crews that had run out of fuel or become stuck on the Steese Highway on January 3rd. On January 5, 2024, weather conditions improved, allowing a DOT&PF crew, Troopers, and a tow truck to recover the vehicle and the bodies safely. Both bodies and the vehicle were transported back to Fairbanks for positive identification and further investigation. They will both be sent to the State Medical Examiner’s Office for autopsy. No foul play is suspected at this time. The identities of the deceased will be released pending positive identification and next of kin notifications.

I have researched a bit on this and my understanding is I would need to go to Fairbank and skip Anchorage if my focus is on nature and northern light. And need to consider

Pros:

- winter months have more night time and less light pollution, less cloudy than rekjavik, great chance seeing northern light, I read that sunset starts at 3:30pm.

- a lot of winter activities

- less tourists? 

Cons: 

- -40 F weather
- most touristy things are closed, denali road closure at Mile 3.
- animal sighting will be scarce

As someone who’s furtherst winter destination was New Hampshire, I just don’t have any idea as to how cold -40 is. Is it even possible to drink water outside? Is following a group absolutely necessary?

Also just how much stuff are open during Christmas? Can I see anything besides trees at all via cars(I searched some photos of fairbank in winter and it looks just like trees on snows)? And would I need to hike miles just to get to the edge of any meaningful landscape? 

If you would not recommend alaska in december/January, where would you recommend me go instead? I searched about yellowstones but seems like most of the roads there will be closed too, but probably will have a more tolerable weather than fairbanks

I was in the Anchorage / Seward / Knik Glacier last summer, and it was obviously amazing in the summer. I know that glacier silt in the Mat-Su valley is a thing.

I have a young family of 5 (ages 5 thru 12), so I know getting plugged into a community quickly will be very important; but what are some other considerations for the area? Is Alaska, and this area, a good place to raise a family? We homeschool already, and generally have pretty conservative values, so is that a good fit for the area? Important question - Does Amazon ship there? :) 

From a 'being independent' perspective - what all would need to be purchased prior to moving to Alaska to be prepared for the environment: snow blower? Tire chains? We've all got decent cold weather gear from skiing, outdoor gear from family camping trips, firearms from years of hunting... but are there other major items you have to aquire to make it there?

I feel like I'm smart enough to know, that I don't know nearly enough about the area - so, grateful for whatever help anyone can provide. ",2024-03-15 21:58:19

- What is worth investing in versus renting? (For instance they offer overboots to rent. Is that a good option or too cold to wear over some basic winter boots?)
- What brands are warm enough and decent quality but still budget friendly?

139,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, dislike",Help needed planning Alaskan National Park trip during November!,"\*\*\*UPDATED 8/6/23\*\*\*

First off, thank you ALL for such thoughtful and detailed responses!  

After taking all of the previous recommendations into consideration, we have officially changed our plans and will be focussing on only visiting Denali, rather than attempting to visit the additional 2 National Parks.

&#x200B;

The current plan is:  
Flying into Anchorage late Friday, 11/3 and staying by the airport.

11/4 - Renting car in Anchorage and driving to stay near Denali National Park.

11/5 - Exploring Denali (staying near Denali National Park)

11/6 - Drive somewhere more north (possibly Nenana or SUGGESTIONS???  to potentially see the northern lights (spend night here)

11/7 - Drive back to and stay in Anchorage

11/8 - Drive to and explore Seward (staying in Seward)

11/9 - Driving back to Anchorage

Does this seem slightly more realistic compared to my Original Post?  Of course, we could get snowed in on our first night and none of this happens, but if we get a little cooperation from the weather, are there any reasons to think this couldn't be doable?

Does anyone have a suggestion for possible northern lights viewing (I have no idea if Nenana would actually be a good place??)

&#x200B;

Again, many thanks to everyone that took the time and effort to really assist with this!  I left the original post below:

&#x200B;

(OP)

I'm going to be in Anchorage, AK for a conference in November and was hoping to utilize the trip to knock out some National Parks, but need some guidance and suggestions from people with more information than me!

Having never been to Alaska, especially not in the winter, I really do not know what to expect or how to properly plan (or what is even possible).

My hope is fly into Anchorage on 11/3, rent a properly winterized 4x4 vehicle and visit Denali, Kenai Fjords & Wrangell-St. Elias from 11/4-11/9 , returning to Anchorage on 11/9.  I will say that I am NOT looking to camp at the parks during this time!  Instead focussing on the scenic views of the National Parks (and potential wildlife) while officially check them off of my ""National Parks Visited"" list.

&#x200B;

I do not know when I will be back in Alaska in the future and really want to potentially visit all three of the driveable National Parks near Anchorage.  Is it manageable to essentially visit one park every two days?

&#x200B;

My initial question for anyone with winter Alaska experience is, is this even possible from a driving perspective?  Between the lack of light and winter driving conditions, am I over estimating what can be done?  Anyone with winter driving experience in Alaska that can give suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

&#x200B;

If I am overestimating, please give some suggestions with what I could possibly change.

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

146,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

(a reach),"Like a dumb dummy, I forgot to save the thread I was reading (either on here or r/skAlaska) a month or so ago about god knows what- where a photographer in Alaska with extensive experience shooting in abject freezing temperatures was dropping some great advice, and invited OP to message them privately to discuss further. If you are that person, I would like to grab some advice if at all possible.

My February visit to Talkeetna is finally materializing and deposits/reservations are being made to cross some lifelong bucket list items off the list. I am a photographer, but won't pretend to have faced the weather or astral conditions I will be looking at in an Alaska winter (I'm mainly involved in concert photography and portraiture).

Outside of the standard ""you know your batteries aren't gonna last as long in the cold"" is there any specific gear or anything else advice I may not be thinking of while participating in extensive sledding, hiking and wandering, snow machining, and flight seeing from arctic-seasoned photographers?

*Also, for what it's worth, while I will certainly take some photos of the Northern Lights because I am there, I am not super into astrophotography, so I am less concerned with the Lights being the subject of photos, but definitely want to get them behind whatever my subject is when/if possible.*

***Gear specific stuff:***

*I am trying not to overpack for this trip, but I wanna make sure I capture some of this stuff and hopefully do the Northern Lights justice, if visible during my short trip. I'll be carrying my Canon r6 for anything important.. I assume a battery grip is ideal? I have two OEM batteries, but I think I may pick up a third emergency battery, or a handful of third parties.*

*Lens-wise I think I will probably bring with me a 24-105 f/4 for most everyday stuff, and pack a 70-200 f/2.8 with a 2x extender for the flightseeing, and then a nifty fifty and a 16mm f/2.8 since they are tiny, portable and faster than the zoom, so why not. I use a Godox V1 as my main flash and will be bringing that with an extra battery as some of the dog sledding will be at night too. In lieu of tripods,  I think I will pack two Joby GorillaPods.. one for the camera and one for the flash, since they are way more portable and I'll be able to secure them to weird stuff if need be.*

*I have a 15mm f/2.8 that I may throw in last second, and since if I am bringing all this stuff anyway, why not? Might make for a cool fisheye photo when dog sledding, I dunno.*",2024-11-14 19:47:24

149,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, annoying",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24

151,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, annoying",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Type: Death Investigation  
Dispatch Text:

On January 3, 2024, at 5:54 pm, the Alaska State Troopers received a report that two adults had not arrived in Circle after departing Fairbanks earlier in the day. The two had reportedly left in a vehicle on January 2, 2024. The vehicle had been spotted stuck in snow at Eagle Summit on the Steese Highway earlier in the day, however, the person that spotted the vehicle was unable to stop to check on the vehicle due to extreme weather conditions in the area. With the assistance of a DOT&PF crew, an Alaska State Trooper responded to Eagle Summit and located the vehicle on the evening of January 3rd. There were whiteout and blizzard conditions in the pass when the trooper and DOT&PF crew located the vehicle - winds were gusting to 60 miles per hour, and there were 10' drifts on the roadway. The Trooper broke the window on the vehicle and located the missing adults, both deceased, inside the vehicle. The extreme weather conditions prevented the Trooper from safely recovering the bodies, so the vehicle was secured until they could safely be recovered. Two other vehicles were assisted by DOT&PF crews that had run out of fuel or become stuck on the Steese Highway on January 3rd. On January 5, 2024, weather conditions improved, allowing a DOT&PF crew, Troopers, and a tow truck to recover the vehicle and the bodies safely. Both bodies and the vehicle were transported back to Fairbanks for positive identification and further investigation. They will both be sent to the State Medical Examiner’s Office for autopsy. No foul play is suspected at this time. The identities of the deceased will be released pending positive identification and next of kin notifications.

154,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, annoying",Visit Alaska during the Christmas season,"Hi alaskans! I am probably a madman but I am planning a very impromptu late december /January solo trip to alaska hoping to see the northern light and experience the winter landscape/nature.

I have researched a bit on this and my understanding is I would need to go to Fairbank and skip Anchorage if my focus is on nature and northern light. And need to consider

Pros:

- winter months have more night time and less light pollution, less cloudy than rekjavik, great chance seeing northern light, I read that sunset starts at 3:30pm.

- a lot of winter activities

- less tourists? 

Cons: 

- -40 F weather
- most touristy things are closed, denali road closure at Mile 3.
- animal sighting will be scarce

As someone who’s furtherst winter destination was New Hampshire, I just don’t have any idea as to how cold -40 is. Is it even possible to drink water outside? Is following a group absolutely necessary?

Also just how much stuff are open during Christmas? Can I see anything besides trees at all via cars(I searched some photos of fairbank in winter and it looks just like trees on snows)? And would I need to hike miles just to get to the edge of any meaningful landscape? 

If you would not recommend alaska in december/January, where would you recommend me go instead? I searched about yellowstones but seems like most of the roads there will be closed too, but probably will have a more tolerable weather than fairbanks

I'm moving from the Dallas, TX area - so obviously, culture and environment shock.

I was in the Anchorage / Seward / Knik Glacier last summer, and it was obviously amazing in the summer. I know that glacier silt in the Mat-Su valley is a thing.

I have a young family of 5 (ages 5 thru 12), so I know getting plugged into a community quickly will be very important; but what are some other considerations for the area? Is Alaska, and this area, a good place to raise a family? We homeschool already, and generally have pretty conservative values, so is that a good fit for the area?

From a 'being independent' perspective - what all would need to be purchased prior to moving to Alaska to be prepared for the environment: snow blower? Tire chains?

162,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, annoying",Help needed planning Alaskan National Park trip during November!,"\*\*\*UPDATED 8/6/23\*\*\*

First off, thank you ALL for such thoughtful and detailed responses!  

After taking all of the previous recommendations into consideration, we have officially changed our plans and will be focussing on only visiting Denali, rather than attempting to visit the additional 2 National Parks.

&#x200B;

The current plan is:  
Flying into Anchorage late Friday, 11/3 and staying by the airport.

11/4 - Renting car in Anchorage and driving to stay near Denali National Park.

11/5 - Exploring Denali (staying near Denali National Park)

11/6 - Drive somewhere more north (possibly Nenana or SUGGESTIONS???  to potentially see the northern lights (spend night here)

11/7 - Drive back to and stay in Anchorage

11/8 - Drive to and explore Seward (staying in Seward)

11/9 - Driving back to Anchorage

Does this seem slightly more realistic compared to my Original Post?  Of course, we could get snowed in on our first night and none of this happens, but if we get a little cooperation from the weather, are there any reasons to think this couldn't be doable?

Does anyone have a suggestion for possible northern lights viewing (I have no idea if Nenana would actually be a good place??)

&#x200B;

Again, many thanks to everyone that took the time and effort to really assist with this!  I left the original post below:

&#x200B;

(OP)

I'm going to be in Anchorage, AK for a conference in November and was hoping to utilize the trip to knock out some National Parks, but need some guidance and suggestions from people with more information than me!

Having never been to Alaska, especially not in the winter, I really do not know what to expect or how to properly plan (or what is even possible).

My hope is fly into Anchorage on 11/3, rent a properly winterized 4x4 vehicle and visit Denali, Kenai Fjords & Wrangell-St. Elias from 11/4-11/9 , returning to Anchorage on 11/9.  I will say that I am NOT looking to camp at the parks during this time!  Instead focussing on the scenic views of the National Parks (and potential wildlife) while officially check them off of my ""National Parks Visited"" list.

&#x200B;

I do not know when I will be back in Alaska in the future and really want to potentially visit all three of the driveable National Parks near Anchorage.  Is it manageable to essentially visit one park every two days?

&#x200B;

My initial question for anyone with winter Alaska experience is, is this even possible from a driving perspective?  Between the lack of light and winter driving conditions, am I over estimating what can be done?  Anyone with winter driving experience in Alaska that can give suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

&#x200B;

If I am overestimating, please give some suggestions with what I could possibly change.

&#x200B;

Thank you in advance!

163,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, annoying",Planning a Week Long Trip in Alaska - Open to ALL suggestions!,"Hey guys! Not to be that annoying tourist trying to plan a trip but also totally being that guy.

My wife and I are looking to come to Alaska for a week in August after a legitimately brutal working year. We are kind of new to planning trips on our own and have done a lot of research into the dos/do nots in Alaska. That said, there really is a ton of information out there and it's becoming hard to try and choose absolute winners of activities that would also give us time to  ""smell the roses""/truly enjoy every spot we go to.

I'm more of a mountaineer than my wife but we're young (30 yo) and can handle physically arduous things barring 1v1 bear fights.

&#x200B;

1.) For a weeks trip, what are some absolute DO NOT MISS things that we should do? Alaska looks beautiful and it seems like we can't go wrong with anything

2.) Our general itinerary would be to fly to Anchorage, then drive to Denali, and then down to the Seward/Homer area. But it sounds like 1 week is not enough time to really do those places justice so we may have to end up cutting out Denali for the below reasons.

We are torn between Denali and the Kenai Peninsula. On one hand, everyone talks about Denali but we saw that there is a landslide that severely limits ground transportation in the area. We mulled over a flight tour but some have pointed out that this summer, rain and fog have made them 50/50 shots. Kenai sounds/looks amazing but compared to some of the bigger sites in Alaska, I haven't heard much about it.

3) I've always wanted to hike on a glacier and was curious as to recommendations on what would be a good one that doesn't take all day. I've heard good things about the Byron, Portage, and Matanuska glaciers that seem to be all a relatively short driving distance from Anchorage.

4) Are snow mobile/ATV tours worth it? They are heavily marketed on some sites.

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

168,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, happy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24

170,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, happy",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

If you are that person, I would like to grab some advice if at all possible.

My February visit to Talkeetna is finally materializing and deposits/reservations are being made to cross some lifelong bucket list items off the list. I am a photographer, but won't pretend to have faced the weather or astral conditions I will be looking at in an Alaska winter (I'm mainly involved in concert photography and portraiture).

Outside of the standard ""you know your batteries aren't gonna last as long in the cold"" is there any specific gear or anything else advice I may not be thinking of while participating in extensive sledding, hiking and wandering, snow machining, and flight seeing from arctic-seasoned photographers?

*Also, for what it's worth, while I will certainly take some photos of the Northern Lights because I am there, I am not super into astrophotography, so I am less concerned with the Lights being the subject of photos, but definitely want to get them behind whatever my subject is when/if possible.*

***Gear specific stuff:***

*I am trying not to overpack for this trip, but I wanna make sure I capture some of this stuff and hopefully do the Northern Lights justice, if visible during my short trip. I'll be carrying my Canon r6 for anything important.. I assume a battery grip is ideal? I have two OEM batteries, but I think I may pick up a third emergency battery, or a handful of third parties.*

*Lens-wise I think I will probably bring with me a 24-105 f/4 for most everyday stuff, and pack a 70-200 f/2.8 with a 2x extender for the flightseeing, and then a nifty fifty and a 16mm f/2.8 since they are tiny, portable and faster than the zoom, so why not. I use a Godox V1 as my main flash and will be bringing that with an extra battery as some of the dog sledding will be at night too. In lieu of tripods,  I think I will pack two Joby GorillaPods.. one for the camera and one for the flash, since they are way more portable and I'll be able to secure them to weird stuff if need be.*

*I have a 15mm f/2.8 that I may throw in last second, and since if I am bringing all this stuff anyway, why not? Might make for a cool fisheye photo when dog sledding, I dunno.*",2024-11-14 19:47:24

It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

178,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, happy",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

180,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, happy","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Location: Eagle Summit, Steese Hwy  
Type: Death Investigation  
Dispatch Text:

On January 3, 2024, at 5:54 pm, the Alaska State Troopers received a report that two adults had not arrived in Circle after departing Fairbanks earlier in the day. The two had reportedly left in a vehicle on January 2, 2024. The vehicle had been spotted stuck in snow at Eagle Summit on the Steese Highway earlier in the day, however, the person that spotted the vehicle was unable to stop to check on the vehicle due to extreme weather conditions in the area. With the assistance of a DOT&PF crew, an Alaska State Trooper responded to Eagle Summit and located the vehicle on the evening of January 3rd. There were whiteout and blizzard conditions in the pass when the trooper and DOT&PF crew located the vehicle - winds were gusting to 60 miles per hour, and there were 10' drifts on the roadway. The Trooper broke the window on the vehicle and located the missing adults, both deceased, inside the vehicle. The extreme weather conditions prevented the Trooper from safely recovering the bodies, so the vehicle was secured until they could safely be recovered. Two other vehicles were assisted by DOT&PF crews that had run out of fuel or become stuck on the Steese Highway on January 3rd. On January 5, 2024, weather conditions improved, allowing a DOT&PF crew, Troopers, and a tow truck to recover the vehicle and the bodies safely. Both bodies and the vehicle were transported back to Fairbanks for positive identification and further investigation. They will both be sent to the State Medical Examiner’s Office for autopsy. No foul play is suspected at this time. The identities of the deceased will be released pending positive identification and next of kin notifications.

I have researched a bit on this and my understanding is I would need to go to Fairbank and skip Anchorage if my focus is on nature and northern light. And need to consider

Pros:

- winter months have more night time and less light pollution, less cloudy than rekjavik, great chance seeing northern light, I read that sunset starts at 3:30pm.

- a lot of winter activities

- less tourists? 

Cons: 

- -40 F weather
- most touristy things are closed, denali road closure at Mile 3.
- animal sighting will be scarce

As someone who’s furtherst winter destination was New Hampshire, I just don’t have any idea as to how cold -40 is. Is it even possible to drink water outside? Is following a group absolutely necessary?

Also just how much stuff are open during Christmas? Can I see anything besides trees at all via cars(I searched some photos of fairbank in winter and it looks just like trees on snows)? And would I need to hike miles just to get to the edge of any meaningful landscape? 

If you would not recommend alaska in december/January, where would you recommend me go instead? I searched about yellowstones but seems like most of the roads there will be closed too, but probably will have a more tolerable weather than fairbanks

191,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, happy",Help needed planning Alaskan National Park trip during November!,"\*\*\*UPDATED 8/6/23\*\*\*

First off, thank you ALL for such thoughtful and detailed responses!  

After taking all of the previous recommendations into consideration, we have officially changed our plans and will be focussing on only visiting Denali, rather than attempting to visit the additional 2 National Parks.

&#x200B;

The current plan is:  
Flying into Anchorage late Friday, 11/3 and staying by the airport.

11/4 - Renting car in Anchorage and driving to stay near Denali National Park.

11/5 - Exploring Denali (staying near Denali National Park)

11/6 - Drive somewhere more north (possibly Nenana or SUGGESTIONS???  to potentially see the northern lights (spend night here)

11/7 - Drive back to and stay in Anchorage

11/8 - Drive to and explore Seward (staying in Seward)

11/9 - Driving back to Anchorage

Does this seem slightly more realistic compared to my Original Post?  Of course, we could get snowed in on our first night and none of this happens, but if we get a little cooperation from the weather, are there any reasons to think this couldn't be doable?

Does anyone have a suggestion for possible northern lights viewing (I have no idea if Nenana would actually be a good place??)

&#x200B;

Again, many thanks to everyone that took the time and effort to really assist with this!  I left the original post below:

&#x200B;

(OP)

I'm going to be in Anchorage, AK for a conference in November and was hoping to utilize the trip to knock out some National Parks, but need some guidance and suggestions from people with more information than me!

Having never been to Alaska, especially not in the winter, I really do not know what to expect or how to properly plan (or what is even possible).

My hope is fly into Anchorage on 11/3, rent a properly winterized 4x4 vehicle and visit Denali, Kenai Fjords & Wrangell-St. Elias from 11/4-11/9 , returning to Anchorage on 11/9.  I will say that I am NOT looking to camp at the parks during this time!  Instead focussing on the scenic views of the National Parks (and potential wildlife) while officially check them off of my ""National Parks Visited"" list.

&#x200B;

I do not know when I will be back in Alaska in the future and really want to potentially visit all three of the driveable National Parks near Anchorage.  Is it manageable to essentially visit one park every two days?

&#x200B;

My initial question for anyone with winter Alaska experience is, is this even possible from a driving perspective?  Between the lack of light and winter driving conditions, am I over estimating what can be done?  Anyone with winter driving experience in Alaska that can give suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

&#x200B;

If I am overestimating, please give some suggestions with what I could possibly change.

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

201,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, annoyed",Cold weather photographers? (a reach),"Like a dumb dummy, I forgot to save the thread I was reading (either on here or r/skAlaska) a month or so ago about god knows what- where a photographer in Alaska with extensive experience shooting in abject freezing temperatures was dropping some great advice, and invited OP to message them privately to discuss further. If you are that person, I would like to grab some advice if at all possible.

My February visit to Talkeetna is finally materializing and deposits/reservations are being made to cross some lifelong bucket list items off the list. I am a photographer, but won't pretend to have faced the weather or astral conditions I will be looking at in an Alaska winter (I'm mainly involved in concert photography and portraiture).

Outside of the standard ""you know your batteries aren't gonna last as long in the cold"" is there any specific gear or anything else advice I may not be thinking of while participating in extensive sledding, hiking and wandering, snow machining, and flight seeing from arctic-seasoned photographers?

*Also, for what it's worth, while I will certainly take some photos of the Northern Lights because I am there, I am not super into astrophotography, so I am less concerned with the Lights being the subject of photos, but definitely want to get them behind whatever my subject is when/if possible.*

***Gear specific stuff:***

*I am trying not to overpack for this trip, but I wanna make sure I capture some of this stuff and hopefully do the Northern Lights justice, if visible during my short trip. I'll be carrying my Canon r6 for anything important.. I assume a battery grip is ideal? I have two OEM batteries, but I think I may pick up a third emergency battery, or a handful of third parties.*

*Lens-wise I think I will probably bring with me a 24-105 f/4 for most everyday stuff, and pack a 70-200 f/2.8 with a 2x extender for the flightseeing, and then a nifty fifty and a 16mm f/2.8 since they are tiny, portable and faster than the zoom, so why not. I use a Godox V1 as my main flash and will be bringing that with an extra battery as some of the dog sledding will be at night too. In lieu of tripods,  I think I will pack two Joby GorillaPods.. one for the camera and one for the flash, since they are way more portable and I'll be able to secure them to weird stuff if need be.*

*I have a 15mm f/2.8 that I may throw in last second, and since if I am bringing all this stuff anyway, why not? Might make for a cool fisheye photo when dog sledding, I dunno.*",2024-11-14 19:47:24

Much of my Googling has led me to winter articles. But from my research, this time of year is not quiteeee the right weather for much of the stuff being suggested by Google because there isn’t quite enough snow yet.

203,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, annoyed",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
204,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, annoyed",Why did you move to Alaska?,"Question for people who have moved from Chicago, Detroit, Toronto or New York City, etc to Alaska. Is the weather much different? How does it compare year round? I’m aware the places mentioned get a lot of snow, however what is the difference between these cities & Anchorage? Share your experiences from anything you noticed was different from weather, accents, food, etc.",2024-02-20 08:43:10
205,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, annoyed",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

206,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, annoyed","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Location: Eagle Summit, Steese Hwy  
Type: Death Investigation  
Dispatch Text:

On January 3, 2024, at 5:54 pm, the Alaska State Troopers received a report that two adults had not arrived in Circle after departing Fairbanks earlier in the day. The two had reportedly left in a vehicle on January 2, 2024. The vehicle had been spotted stuck in snow at Eagle Summit on the Steese Highway earlier in the day, however, the person that spotted the vehicle was unable to stop to check on the vehicle due to extreme weather conditions in the area. With the assistance of a DOT&PF crew, an Alaska State Trooper responded to Eagle Summit and located the vehicle on the evening of January 3rd. There were whiteout and blizzard conditions in the pass when the trooper and DOT&PF crew located the vehicle - winds were gusting to 60 miles per hour, and there were 10' drifts on the roadway. The Trooper broke the window on the vehicle and located the missing adults, both deceased, inside the vehicle. The extreme weather conditions prevented the Trooper from safely recovering the bodies, so the vehicle was secured until they could safely be recovered. Two other vehicles were assisted by DOT&PF crews that had run out of fuel or become stuck on the Steese Highway on January 3rd. On January 5, 2024, weather conditions improved, allowing a DOT&PF crew, Troopers, and a tow truck to recover the vehicle and the bodies safely. Both bodies and the vehicle were transported back to Fairbanks for positive identification and further investigation. They will both be sent to the State Medical Examiner’s Office for autopsy. No foul play is suspected at this time. The identities of the deceased will be released pending positive identification and next of kin notifications.

I have researched a bit on this and my understanding is I would need to go to Fairbank and skip Anchorage if my focus is on nature and northern light. And need to consider

Pros:

- winter months have more night time and less light pollution, less cloudy than rekjavik, great chance seeing northern light, I read that sunset starts at 3:30pm.

- a lot of winter activities

- less tourists? 

Cons: 

- -40 F weather
- most touristy things are closed, denali road closure at Mile 3.
- animal sighting will be scarce

As someone who’s furtherst winter destination was New Hampshire, I just don’t have any idea as to how cold -40 is. Is it even possible to drink water outside? Is following a group absolutely necessary?

Also just how much stuff are open during Christmas? Can I see anything besides trees at all via cars(I searched some photos of fairbank in winter and it looks just like trees on snows)? And would I need to hike miles just to get to the edge of any meaningful landscape? 

If you would not recommend alaska in december/January, where would you recommend me go instead? I searched about yellowstones but seems like most of the roads there will be closed too, but probably will have a more tolerable weather than fairbanks

216,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, annoyed",Help needed planning Alaskan National Park trip during November!,"\*\*\*UPDATED 8/6/23\*\*\*

First off, thank you ALL for such thoughtful and detailed responses!  

After taking all of the previous recommendations into consideration, we have officially changed our plans and will be focussing on only visiting Denali, rather than attempting to visit the additional 2 National Parks.

&#x200B;

The current plan is:  
Flying into Anchorage late Friday, 11/3 and staying by the airport.

11/4 - Renting car in Anchorage and driving to stay near Denali National Park.

11/5 - Exploring Denali (staying near Denali National Park)

11/6 - Drive somewhere more north (possibly Nenana or SUGGESTIONS???  to potentially see the northern lights (spend night here)

11/7 - Drive back to and stay in Anchorage

11/8 - Drive to and explore Seward (staying in Seward)

11/9 - Driving back to Anchorage

Does this seem slightly more realistic compared to my Original Post?  Of course, we could get snowed in on our first night and none of this happens, but if we get a little cooperation from the weather, are there any reasons to think this couldn't be doable?

Does anyone have a suggestion for possible northern lights viewing (I have no idea if Nenana would actually be a good place??)

&#x200B;

Again, many thanks to everyone that took the time and effort to really assist with this!  I left the original post below:

&#x200B;

(OP)

I'm going to be in Anchorage, AK for a conference in November and was hoping to utilize the trip to knock out some National Parks, but need some guidance and suggestions from people with more information than me!

Having never been to Alaska, especially not in the winter, I really do not know what to expect or how to properly plan (or what is even possible).

My hope is fly into Anchorage on 11/3, rent a properly winterized 4x4 vehicle and visit Denali, Kenai Fjords & Wrangell-St. Elias from 11/4-11/9 , returning to Anchorage on 11/9.  I will say that I am NOT looking to camp at the parks during this time!  Instead focussing on the scenic views of the National Parks (and potential wildlife) while officially check them off of my ""National Parks Visited"" list.

&#x200B;

I do not know when I will be back in Alaska in the future and really want to potentially visit all three of the driveable National Parks near Anchorage.  Is it manageable to essentially visit one park every two days?

&#x200B;

My initial question for anyone with winter Alaska experience is, is this even possible from a driving perspective?  Between the lack of light and winter driving conditions, am I over estimating what can be done?  Anyone with winter driving experience in Alaska that can give suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

&#x200B;

If I am overestimating, please give some suggestions with what I could possibly change.

&#x200B;

Thank you in advance!

My wife and I are looking to come to Alaska for a week in August after a legitimately brutal working year. We are kind of new to planning trips on our own and have done a lot of research into the dos/do nots in Alaska. That said, there really is a ton of information out there and it's becoming hard to try and choose absolute winners of activities that would also give us time to  ""smell the roses""/truly enjoy every spot we go to.

I'm more of a mountaineer than my wife but we're young (30 yo) and can handle physically arduous things barring 1v1 bear fights.

&#x200B;

1.) For a weeks trip, what are some absolute DO NOT MISS things that we should do? Alaska looks beautiful and it seems like we can't go wrong with anything

2.) Our general itinerary would be to fly to Anchorage, then drive to Denali, and then down to the Seward/Homer area. But it sounds like 1 week is not enough time to really do those places justice so we may have to end up cutting out Denali for the below reasons.

We are torn between Denali and the Kenai Peninsula. On one hand, everyone talks about Denali but we saw that there is a landslide that severely limits ground transportation in the area. We mulled over a flight tour but some have pointed out that this summer, rain and fog have made them 50/50 shots. Kenai sounds/looks amazing but compared to some of the bigger sites in Alaska, I haven't heard much about it.

3) I've always wanted to hike on a glacier and was curious as to recommendations on what would be a good one that doesn't take all day. I've heard good things about the Byron, Portage, and Matanuska glaciers that seem to be all a relatively short driving distance from Anchorage.

4) Are snow mobile/ATV tours worth it? They are heavily marketed on some sites.

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

Im also not sure if coming in February is the best idea with the weather and such so any suggestions would be great.  We were looking at dog sledding, snow mobiles, brewery tours, seafood and possibly a trip to Seward or any other spot you guys would recommend.  Would love any advice or tips.

If you are that person, I would like to grab some advice if at all possible.

My February visit to Talkeetna is finally materializing and deposits/reservations are being made to cross some lifelong bucket list items off the list. I am a photographer, but won't pretend to have faced the weather or astral conditions I will be looking at in an Alaska winter (I'm mainly involved in concert photography and portraiture).

Outside of the standard ""you know your batteries aren't gonna last as long in the cold"" is there any specific gear or anything else advice I may not be thinking of while participating in extensive sledding, hiking and wandering, snow machining, and flight seeing from arctic-seasoned photographers?

*Also, for what it's worth, while I will certainly take some photos of the Northern Lights because I am there, I am not super into astrophotography, so I am less concerned with the Lights being the subject of photos, but definitely want to get them behind whatever my subject is when/if possible.*

***Gear specific stuff:***

*I am trying not to overpack for this trip, but I wanna make sure I capture some of this stuff and hopefully do the Northern Lights justice, if visible during my short trip. I'll be carrying my Canon r6 for anything important.. I assume a battery grip is ideal? I have two OEM batteries, but I think I may pick up a third emergency battery, or a handful of third parties.*

*Lens-wise I think I will probably bring with me a 24-105 f/4 for most everyday stuff, and pack a 70-200 f/2.8 with a 2x extender for the flightseeing, and then a nifty fifty and a 16mm f/2.8 since they are tiny, portable and faster than the zoom, so why not. I use a Godox V1 as my main flash and will be bringing that with an extra battery as some of the dog sledding will be at night too. In lieu of tripods,  I think I will pack two Joby GorillaPods.. one for the camera and one for the flash, since they are way more portable and I'll be able to secure them to weird stuff if need be.*

*I have a 15mm f/2.8 that I may throw in last second, and since if I am bringing all this stuff anyway, why not? Might make for a cool fisheye photo when dog sledding, I dunno.*",2024-11-14 19:47:24
225,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, comfortable",Vanning it for College in Anchorage,"I'm hoping to be attending University of Alaska Anchorage starting next fall. I've been living out of a van for 4 years (including wintering through at ski resorts in Washington). So I'm comfortable in the cold with my setup, having experienced the struggle of -20 degree nights, and cold days with little to no sun. The intention however, is to do long-term stays Fall-Spring at RV parks (I've found 3 already, right near the University that would be open for that kind of stay).   


I suppose my questions are these: during winter, how are the roads within Anchorage? I assume that like mountain towns in WA, they'd have pretty good road clearing systems. Are power outages common? This could come as a heavy hit if it's longer than a few days in a van that's generally staying hooked up all the time. What types of communal areas are generally available during the winter? Are places like coffee shops and libraries where you can hang out and study without being on campus fairly common? And any other comments you might have that may be helpful. Just for clarification purposes though, bear in mind - I am comfortably familiar with living out of a van in harsh winter conditions. Looking at record highs and lows, and average highs and lows and snow fall amounts - what's up there seems to be pretty well within the same parameters I usually operate in during the winter when living at ski resorts for the winter in the van.

227,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, comfortable",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24

229,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, comfortable",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

230,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, comfortable","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

Location: Eagle Summit, Steese Hwy  
Type: Death Investigation  
Dispatch Text:

On January 3, 2024, at 5:54 pm, the Alaska State Troopers received a report that two adults had not arrived in Circle after departing Fairbanks earlier in the day. The two had reportedly left in a vehicle on January 2, 2024. The vehicle had been spotted stuck in snow at Eagle Summit on the Steese Highway earlier in the day, however, the person that spotted the vehicle was unable to stop to check on the vehicle due to extreme weather conditions in the area. With the assistance of a DOT&PF crew, an Alaska State Trooper responded to Eagle Summit and located the vehicle on the evening of January 3rd. There were whiteout and blizzard conditions in the pass when the trooper and DOT&PF crew located the vehicle - winds were gusting to 60 miles per hour, and there were 10' drifts on the roadway. The Trooper broke the window on the vehicle and located the missing adults, both deceased, inside the vehicle. The extreme weather conditions prevented the Trooper from safely recovering the bodies, so the vehicle was secured until they could safely be recovered. Two other vehicles were assisted by DOT&PF crews that had run out of fuel or become stuck on the Steese Highway on January 3rd. On January 5, 2024, weather conditions improved, allowing a DOT&PF crew, Troopers, and a tow truck to recover the vehicle and the bodies safely. Both bodies and the vehicle were transported back to Fairbanks for positive identification and further investigation. They will both be sent to the State Medical Examiner’s Office for autopsy. No foul play is suspected at this time. The identities of the deceased will be released pending positive identification and next of kin notifications.

Have a 2022 Ford Escape and more specifically the 4 cylinder AWD Hybrid model. Ford advertises that I should have around 1500 lb towing capacity and that a small teardrop trailer is fine to tow. I'm looking into getting the UHaul trailer hitch installed that has a 4500 lb capacity. There are two trailers from UHaul that I think I should be comfortable to tow. I'm waffling between the 4x8 and the 5x8 enclosed trailers they have to offer. The 4x8 already weighs around 850lbs and the 5x8 listed as 900lbs. So I was thinking to be safe and within 80% of my towing capacity it only gives me between 300 - 350 lbs depending on which model I were to choose. 

My biggest question for the group is whether or not the 4x8 or 5x8 would be reasonable on the Alaska Highway. It's not my first time driving it so I do remember the steep hills, which is a cause of my concern. If there was anyone with advice weather the 5x8 would be better off than the 4x8 or vice-a-versa it would be greatly appreciated. 

  
I have already looked into possibly pulling my car via their 10ft box trailer and it comes out closer to $3k which is less appealing.

I am probably a madman but I am planning a very impromptu late december /January solo trip to alaska hoping to see the northern light and experience the winter landscape/nature.

I have researched a bit on this and my understanding is I would need to go to Fairbank and skip Anchorage if my focus is on nature and northern light. And need to consider

Pros:

- winter months have more night time and less light pollution, less cloudy than rekjavik, great chance seeing northern light, I read that sunset starts at 3:30pm.

- a lot of winter activities

- less tourists? 

Cons: 

- -40 F weather
- most touristy things are closed, denali road closure at Mile 3.
- animal sighting will be scarce

As someone who’s furtherst winter destination was New Hampshire, I just don’t have any idea as to how cold -40 is. Is it even possible to drink water outside? Is following a group absolutely necessary?

Also just how much stuff are open during Christmas? Can I see anything besides trees at all via cars(I searched some photos of fairbank in winter and it looks just like trees on snows)? And would I need to hike miles just to get to the edge of any meaningful landscape? 

If you would not recommend alaska in december/January, where would you recommend me go instead? I searched about yellowstones but seems like most of the roads there will be closed too, but probably will have a more tolerable weather than fairbanks

240,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, comfortable",Cost to Live in Alaska,"Hey y'all. Kids and I are moving to Alaska this spring after the house sales. I've always wanted to move there since I was a kid reading Balto, Julie of the Wolves, Hatchet, My Side of the Mountain, and Island of the Blue Dolphins (know some aren't about Alaska but it's always reminded me of it for some reason).  The kids want to move also so we are all on board.

We've been redoing the house with lots of sweat equity so it sells better/for more. Getting the trucks (all 4wd)  rock solid and replacing everything on them. We've been downsizing and focusing on keeping tools and other needs vs stuff/wants/furniture. Ive homeschooled all the kids so lots of stuff. Researching by watching every YouTube homestead/fish/hunt/family video I can find, asking questions, taking notes and even watching Alaskan Costco and Grocery Hauls to see how the cost of groceries compare.

We are gardeners/farmers/homesteaders and the kids are 15-24 yrs old. Kids have grown up farming; garden, meat rabbits, pigs, dairy goats, chickens, ducks, quail, turkeys and we process our own meat as well as can; PC & WB, ferment, bake bread, make cheese, and dehydrate.

We don't like living here in TN at all. We moved here 4 years ago, after my husband passed away and I lost our farm in Ohio. I've a mortgage with a low interest rate on 3 acres here in TN.  We raise most all our food. We can afford living here but we are so unhappy and simply don't fit in here. 

 Kids can't afford to live on their own working full time    and  they want to find partners someday who work as hard as they do. I don't blame them as it's hard to find anyone with a good work ethic or people who are willing to work things out in a relationship based on what I've seen.. They were raised not to settle for red 
 flags and that relationships don't just happen...they're a give and take and no one should keep score. 

Lol, I know I sound like, ""I'm not like other girls."" right now. 

I work from home and that makes nearly all my income. The farm brings in the extra we need. I can continue working from home when we move to Alaska as long as I've internet. 

I know we will take a hit with the farm income/ animals since everyone gardens up there and there is a short season and we will not be set up the first year and will be starting over and just handling  infrastructure so to speak. We are canning up any extra veggies to  help counter that financial hit while we get established. We will be bringing some livestock babies with us; piglets, meat rabbits, Icelandics, and  quail. We are converting a trailer so they'll have housing when we get there we don't have to build and bringing our portable solar fencing with us for runs until we get a permanent space for them.

My oldest has a ""good job"" here working 12-14 hr days 6 days a week at $12 and he can just now afford an apartment and utilities on his own...as long as he was to eat ramen and doesn't meet someone. So he still lives at home and he is how we are affording to remodel the house.  I also grew up doing this so while no expert I was raised by parents who were/are and I can do enough diy to stay out of trouble.

We plan on building a small home/cabin on a few acres when we move up to Alaska. Our old farm was a tiny house on solar (but my husband who passed set it up so I'm not confident'going off grid' without a backup plan) and we had rainwater catchment as well as a spring fed pond for watering the animals. We also had a composting toilet. Ohio gets down to -10 but doesn't have the amount of snow AK does nor the constant negative temps. Ohio has a ton of humidity though and folks keep telling me Alaska is a dry snow so you don't get wet so I've my doubts about this information.  I keep thinking a freezer is dry inside but you'll still freeze to death locked in it even with your coveralls.

We also heated with wood. Bub and Sexy Beast of a Hubby cut it for us. Girls and I are not well versed on chopping wood but aren't afraid to learn. We did stack well though lol. I've also bought safety gear, a chainsaw light enough for me/the girls a big one for my moose of a son.  Figure a log splitter will equalize us in who can split wood.

I  read an article about evictions, folks not able to feed their family, cost of food has doubled and I'm having a slight panic attack and need your knowledge and experience. 

I put in our income in a cost of living and it said in order to maintain our current lifestyle (which is a very diy/self sufficient) we would need to earn an extra 35k a year!

How much are your utilities? What is the cost per kilowatt(?). How.much is water? How many in your family? How many cords per year for how many sq feet? How much is a cord of seasomed wood ( will need a years worth off the bat since wood we'd get would be wet). How much are groceries and how much of your own food do you grow/raise/harvest?

I want to connect to the grid and be on the road system cause I want to make sure we don't freeze to death or die in a snow drift and electric is not my most comfortable thing to work with plus winter means we'd still be running a generator so...maybe later once we're not building the property.
We do not have any friends here (being a widow tends to freak people out that it's contagious or they think yosomesomeu want their janky husband...heifer I had a King and this Queen doesn't settle for junk.) bit are working to build community.  We left Ohio mainly due to extended family that we have 0 contact with. 

Kids and I are on our own in every way and we are ok with that but they want healthy supportive partners  and we would love to  have friends that like bonfires, grilling out, see value in a stocked pantry, will trade you some time processing chickens or pigs for chickens or pork, don't only do things that require $ (like don't kids hike anymore? When did a date have to be an expensive restaurant? Picnics rock and it doesn't require going broke. And never hear....""Why don't you just buy meat from the grocery store?""

Am I being paranoid or is this a dream we need to put on hold longer, save up more (money from house selling is what/how we will buy land & materials up there)? I am a worrier and house goes up this spring. I get it could be cold feet but we are talking moving everything almost 5000 miles over 12 days. 

Any helpful advice and constructive criticism would be most helpful and welcome.",2023-07-24 21:10:44

242,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, comfortable",Help needed planning Alaskan National Park trip during November!,"\*\*\*UPDATED 8/6/23\*\*\*

First off, thank you ALL for such thoughtful and detailed responses!  

After taking all of the previous recommendations into consideration, we have officially changed our plans and will be focussing on only visiting Denali, rather than attempting to visit the additional 2 National Parks.

&#x200B;

The current plan is:  
Flying into Anchorage late Friday, 11/3 and staying by the airport.

11/4 - Renting car in Anchorage and driving to stay near Denali National Park.

11/5 - Exploring Denali (staying near Denali National Park)

11/6 - Drive somewhere more north (possibly Nenana or SUGGESTIONS???  to potentially see the northern lights (spend night here)

11/7 - Drive back to and stay in Anchorage

11/8 - Drive to and explore Seward (staying in Seward)

11/9 - Driving back to Anchorage

Does this seem slightly more realistic compared to my Original Post?  Of course, we could get snowed in on our first night and none of this happens, but if we get a little cooperation from the weather, are there any reasons to think this couldn't be doable?

Does anyone have a suggestion for possible northern lights viewing (I have no idea if Nenana would actually be a good place??)

&#x200B;

Again, many thanks to everyone that took the time and effort to really assist with this!  I left the original post below:

&#x200B;

(OP)

I'm going to be in Anchorage, AK for a conference in November and was hoping to utilize the trip to knock out some National Parks, but need some guidance and suggestions from people with more information than me!

Having never been to Alaska, especially not in the winter, I really do not know what to expect or how to properly plan (or what is even possible).

My hope is fly into Anchorage on 11/3, rent a properly winterized 4x4 vehicle and visit Denali, Kenai Fjords & Wrangell-St. Elias from 11/4-11/9 , returning to Anchorage on 11/9.  I will say that I am NOT looking to camp at the parks during this time!  Instead focussing on the scenic views of the National Parks (and potential wildlife) while officially check them off of my ""National Parks Visited"" list.

&#x200B;

I do not know when I will be back in Alaska in the future and really want to potentially visit all three of the driveable National Parks near Anchorage.  Is it manageable to essentially visit one park every two days?

&#x200B;

My initial question for anyone with winter Alaska experience is, is this even possible from a driving perspective?  Between the lack of light and winter driving conditions, am I over estimating what can be done?  Anyone with winter driving experience in Alaska that can give suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

&#x200B;

If I am overestimating, please give some suggestions with what I could possibly change.

&#x200B;

Thank you in advance!

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

245,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, comfortable","Moving to Juneau, question about cars","Hi everyone! I know this is a typical “moving” post but I have received mixed responses from others on what to do about a car if moving to Juneau.

Not pulling the trigger on moving until I’ve got employment offers, but there is no question, I am for sure moving up there eventually because my fiancé will be going up there for work in a month. 

Right now I have a 2WD Buick encore, it’s completely paid off and has no issues. I have read that if moving up to Alaska it is probably best to sell it and get a 4WD car. However this is a tough financial decision for me to make because I just graduated PA school and am already in a lot of debt. And obviously the market for cars is rough and expensive at the moment. 

Any insights into how drivable Juneau is with a 2WD car? I’ve read the winters are much milder compared to other areas of Alaska and that the main concern is rain. Obviously I am going to prioritize safety over everything so if it’s really not safe to take my car up there I will just have to bite the bullet. 

Also putting a plug in here for jobs. I’m a physician assistant and right now I’m not seeing any openings in town but hoping maybe word of mouth will get me somewhere. Any leads for this are very appreciated!


UPDATE: I appreciate everyone’s thoughts on here it’s been helpful and informative. I came up for two weeks to get my bearings and find a job and I did just that(did not find a PA job yet but got a decent paying McJob, gotta start somewhere). My AWD rental was slipping and sliding on certain days however(no incidents or getting stuck) and the clearance was pretty high in some areas after a snow dumping, so that basically told me I need to sell my car cause I am not comfortable driving a 2WD like that. I’m also getting quite a lot more for my car than I thought due to inflated prices so yeah! The locals told me this was as bad as it’s gonna get icy conditions wise but I just want to be safe and get to work alright lol. Thanks again.",2023-01-19 05:30:47

249,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, love",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

250,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, love",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

251,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, love",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).

253,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

Should I do my flight school here in Central VA or move to Anchorage or Fairbanks, get a welding job and take flight school there since I'll be more adjusted to the weather Alaska will have to offer during my training? I want to be apart of this community, it can sound campy and probably just spew from someone who's young and dumb (I'm 25 as of posting this) but the allure of being someone that can take hunters, researchers, hikers, campers, and guides out to difficult spots and to assist in bringing supplies to communities, helping others out, being apart of something great is constantly drumming at my soul. I am at a stage of analysis paralysis and there's contradictory information out there on which is the best path.

Thank you for y'alls time and I hope I got the wording of this out.

Living in California currently. I'll be arriving in Anchorage a few days early and doing some shopping at Costco, and some other stores if you guys have any recommendations.

**Anything I should buy here specifically before I leave?**

**What should I bring that I probably am not thinking about?**

**Is it ever shorts/ flipflop weather up there?**

**To anyone that's done this, or something similar, what's the crowd like? How's day to day?**

257,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
258,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

260,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, love",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

266,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, love",Excursion Recommendations - Planning for Parents,"Hi Everyone,

I am planning an Alaska Cruise for my parents. I've booked a Cruise and Land Tour via Princess on the Sapphire from July 20 - Aug 1, 2024. I would love to hear people's thoughts on the comments, excursions picked, and if they would swap it out for any other experiences. My parent's do not have any mobility issues, but are also in their 70s and not the most active. They could do a few miles hiking, but would nothing too adventurous and wouldn't want my Mom on uneven terrain for too long.  Also, my Mom is vegetarian.

1. Ketchikan - July 22 - 6:00 AM - 2:00 PM
   1. Saxman Native Village, Dance Performance & Totem Park via Princess
   2. Spend remaining time exploring the town and lunch (Annabelle's vs Alaska Fish House)
   3. NOTE: I would love for them to do an easy hike that would allow them to see some scenery and possibly wildlife. In an ideal world, they would do some Bear viewing tour, but those are all 400-1000 bucks, which is out of budget for this port.
   4. NOTE #2: I offered for them to do the Misty Fjords Seaplane, and because they're doing the helicopter tour and a boat tour later on, decided against it. I could persuade them if people felt strongly about it.
2. Juneau - July 23, - 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM
   1. Harv and Marv's Whale Watching Tour - 10:30 AM - 2:30 PM
   2. Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Park + Nugget Fall's
   3. Rest of time exploring Juneau with Dinner at Tracy's?
   4. NOTE: I offered doing Whale Watching + Helicopter here - but they didn't want to pack the day with too many things since it's a long trip.
3. Skagway - July 24 - 7:00 AM - 8:30 PM
   1. TEMSCO Glacier Helicopter Tour - one benefit of this is that if it gets canceled due to weather, they could be rescheduled for the Denali Helicopter Tour later on
   2. Some other activity? - Klondike Summit/Suspension Bridge?
4. Mt. McKinley Wilderness Lodge (nearest excursion site is Talkeetna?) - July 27 afternoon through July 29 morning
   1. Mahay's Riverboat Devil's Canyon Adventure
   2. NOTE: I offered doing Talkeetna Air Taxi's flightseeing tour - but I think they want a Helicopter.
   3. Not sure what else can really do here

267,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, love",Things to do around Anchorage in early April?,"Hi Alaskans, I read a few tourist websites( [https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/](https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/)) that recommend visiting Anchorage in March/April. I have never been to Alaska and I have been on the mid atlantic since forever. What are your remmendations for things to do around this time of year?

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

268,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, love",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

Since we met there, we thought it would be sweet.
 
I've always been an avid xcountry skier, and she's good at both, but neither of us have ever done an overnight winter backcountry trip. We do have lots of experience in cold weather though ( lived in fbx) and we love to backpack. 

Through reccomendationa from friends, we decided to celebrate by doing a part of ressurection pass: the north entrance to Caribou Creek Cabin ( 7 -8 miles). 

I haven't seen much info on doing this part in the winter. 

Anyone have any experience with this trail? Are we being stupid going this time of year?

That said, I’m in anchorage for work, the dates are set, and I plan to extend the visit with my wife (both early thirties). 

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time. 

Appreciate any guidance this group can provide. Have visited Alaska before, love it, and can’t wait to be back with my wife.",2023-08-13 20:54:47

I have an all day Kenai Fjords boat tour booked on one of the very small boats. The marine forecast has turned and we may not be able to get to Aialik Bay. My question is- do you think the benefits of a small boat tour make it worth it to keep this booking and possibly stay in Resurrection Bay? Or should I go with a larger boat that is not quite so weather dependent? I'm in it more for the wildlife possibilities, especially since the fog might make scenery visibility nil. 
But as you all know, the small boat tours are $$$ compared to the big boys and this was one of the biggest splurges of our trip.

276,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, love",Questions in advance of trip,"I’m currently planning a two-week trip to Alaska with my girlfriend (August 8-21). At the moment, specific timing is mostly up in the air, but we’re 100% planning on Denali, Seward, and some day trips near Anchorage. While the flair is mostly tongue-in-cheek - I always try to do my own research before asking questions on Reddit - I still have a few questions either based on what I’ve read or that I couldn’t find online:

* I was seeing a lot of recommendations to book things in advance, but I want to be flexible in case of inclement weather (plus, still figuring out the itinerary). That said, for a lot of the things I was looking at (flightseeing, Kenai Fjords, trains, various kayaking trips, etc.), there’s plenty of availability, even if I wanted to go tomorrow or next week. Is it still advisable to book things weeks in advance, or would a few days suffice at this point? Is there a bigger tourist spike in August?

* I’ll be doing the Skinny Raven Half on 8/20 and want to try to keep my training up. While I feel decent about running opportunities in Anchorage (within downtown or in parks), I wanted to see if there would be similar opportunities near Denali or Seward - I’m used to road running, but I can do paved or even trails. I figured that Seward would be easy enough to just run around downtown, but I’m a bit iffy on Denali - one idea I had was running up and down Parks Highway for a few miles, but if this is a moronic idea, I’d definitely like to know (and also understand what to expect in terms of wildlife). 

* On another note, based on what I saw from a previous post, bear spray is advisable for runs - I wanted to confirm that this is the case even in Anchorage and Seward. Already planning on no headphones, but open to other recommendations and advice from runners, since I’m so used to running in cities and city parks. 

* Finally, I’ve done some baseline research, but I’m always up for any suggestions for restaurants and breweries, anywhere between Denali and Seward - especially love unique local food and smaller neighborhood brewpubs whose products I would never find out of state. If any of you have places you want to shout out, would love to hear about it!

Thanks in advance - can’t wait to visit!",2023-07-22 16:23:23
277,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, hate",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

279,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
280,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, hate",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice?

286,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
288,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, enjoy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
289,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, enjoy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

I do photography so any related suggestions there would be great.

Since, I am by myself it would be exciting to find likeminded people who enjoy outdoors and learn about Alaska with them.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

297,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, enjoy","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57
298,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, dislike",Anniversary Trip,"I’d like to take my wife on a trip to Alaska for our anniversary in September. It doesn’t necessarily have to be in September but idk when tourists are heavy there (I’d imagine during the summer). What are some good places to go and hotels/cabins/lodges for couples that aren’t too touristy but still get the most out of the trip? I already know flights are gonna be wild (unless yall got some airline tips you can pass on👀) but our budget is probably gonna be in the neighborhood of 2-3k excluding flights and we’ll be there for about a week.

299,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

301,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, happy",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50
302,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, happy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
303,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, happy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

As the title states, I’m wondering if folks have any idea of work that would allow me to travel the Aleutian Islands?

Long story short, I grew up in Alaska and have since moved away. The last year or so I have been feeling the urge to swim back upstream (sorry, couldn’t resist) but would like to explore someplace new.  

I’m definitely not into working in a cannery and I don’t know how I’d fair on a fishing boat but other than those two, if I get to be outside I’m into it.

Not that it’s directly applicable but I’ve been a wildland firefighter these last eight years so hard work and weather won’t scare me off. In fact, I think I’d be most happy camping and hiking heavy loads through the wilderness.

307,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, annoyed",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

309,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, comfortable",Which UHaul Trailer should I choose for the Alaska Highway?,"Driving the Alaska highway down to the lower 48 from AK this August. Have a 2022 Ford Escape and more specifically the 4 cylinder AWD Hybrid model. Ford advertises that I should have around 1500 lb towing capacity and that a small teardrop trailer is fine to tow. I'm looking into getting the UHaul trailer hitch installed that has a 4500 lb capacity. There are two trailers from UHaul that I think I should be comfortable to tow. I'm waffling between the 4x8 and the 5x8 enclosed trailers they have to offer. The 4x8 already weighs around 850lbs and the 5x8 listed as 900lbs. So I was thinking to be safe and within 80% of my towing capacity it only gives me between 300 - 350 lbs depending on which model I were to choose. 

My biggest question for the group is whether or not the 4x8 or 5x8 would be reasonable on the Alaska Highway. It's not my first time driving it so I do remember the steep hills, which is a cause of my concern. If there was anyone with advice weather the 5x8 would be better off than the 4x8 or vice-a-versa it would be greatly appreciated. 

  
I have already looked into possibly pulling my car via their 10ft box trailer and it comes out closer to $3k which is less appealing.

And none of the closures have been blizzards or emergencies, just normal snowfall!

In the summer, I want to take my kids on the same trails I played on with my friends as a kid. But they are filled with homeless people, some of whom have assaulted and SA’d minors. Even supervised, it doesn’t seem like a safe place for kids.

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

316,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, love",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).

318,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
319,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, love",Becoming a Bush Pilot ,"Hey y'all, my name is Spencer and for a long time I've had this need to go and live in Alaska, I'm a welder and have other limited experiences with car work, plumbing, outdoors skills, hunting, fishing, and kayaking. I have been doing as much research as I can online about what would be the best path for me to take to become a Bush Pilot in God's country. Should I do my flight school here in Central VA or move to Anchorage or Fairbanks, get a welding job and take flight school there since I'll be more adjusted to the weather Alaska will have to offer during my training? I want to be apart of this community, it can sound campy and probably just spew from someone who's young and dumb (I'm 25 as of posting this) but the allure of being someone that can take hunters, researchers, hikers, campers, and guides out to difficult spots and to assist in bringing supplies to communities, helping others out, being apart of something great is constantly drumming at my soul. I am at a stage of analysis paralysis and there's contradictory information out there on which is the best path. I don't want to take a lazy route, I want to earn this and be great to myself and others, I just want to know the best way to go about it. 

Thank you for y'alls time and I hope I got the wording of this out. If it helps any extra on where I'd like to make a more permanent living, the south east to south central parts of the state is what's attractive to me as a place for home but that can change once in the motion and falling in love with another spot. 

Again thank you all for your time!",2024-04-28 20:59:03

I just got a gig bartending up in Healy for the Summer season and I don't really know what to expect. I'm excited but I don't know anyone who has done anything like this. Living in California currently. I'll be arriving in Anchorage a few days early and doing some shopping at Costco, and some other stores if you guys have any recommendations.

**Anything I should buy here specifically before I leave?**

**What should I bring that I probably am not thinking about?**

**Is it ever shorts/ flipflop weather up there?**

**To anyone that's done this, or something similar, what's the crowd like? How's day to day?**

322,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
323,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

I am planning an Alaska Cruise for my parents. I've booked a Cruise and Land Tour via Princess on the Sapphire from July 20 - Aug 1, 2024. I would love to hear people's thoughts on the comments, excursions picked, and if they would swap it out for any other experiences. My parent's do not have any mobility issues, but are also in their 70s and not the most active. They could do a few miles hiking, but would nothing too adventurous and wouldn't want my Mom on uneven terrain for too long.  Also, my Mom is vegetarian.

1. Ketchikan - July 22 - 6:00 AM - 2:00 PM
   1. Saxman Native Village, Dance Performance & Totem Park via Princess
   2. Spend remaining time exploring the town and lunch (Annabelle's vs Alaska Fish House)
   3. NOTE: I would love for them to do an easy hike that would allow them to see some scenery and possibly wildlife. In an ideal world, they would do some Bear viewing tour, but those are all 400-1000 bucks, which is out of budget for this port.
   4. NOTE #2: I offered for them to do the Misty Fjords Seaplane, and because they're doing the helicopter tour and a boat tour later on, decided against it. I could persuade them if people felt strongly about it.
2. Juneau - July 23, - 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM
   1. Harv and Marv's Whale Watching Tour - 10:30 AM - 2:30 PM
   2. Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Park + Nugget Fall's
   3. Rest of time exploring Juneau with Dinner at Tracy's?
   4. NOTE: I offered doing Whale Watching + Helicopter here - but they didn't want to pack the day with too many things since it's a long trip.
3. Skagway - July 24 - 7:00 AM - 8:30 PM
   1. TEMSCO Glacier Helicopter Tour - one benefit of this is that if it gets canceled due to weather, they could be rescheduled for the Denali Helicopter Tour later on
   2. Some other activity? - Klondike Summit/Suspension Bridge?
4. Mt. McKinley Wilderness Lodge (nearest excursion site is Talkeetna?) - July 27 afternoon through July 29 morning
   1. Mahay's Riverboat Devil's Canyon Adventure
   2. NOTE: I offered doing Talkeetna Air Taxi's flightseeing tour - but I think they want a Helicopter.
   3. Not sure what else can really do here
5. Denali Princess Wilderness Lodge - July 29 afternoon - July 31 AM
   1. Included Denali Natural History Tour - Upgrade to Tundra Wilderness vs Kantishna
   2. Not sure if there's something to fit in July 29 afternoon

I appreciate any help or suggestions-  thank you!",2024-01-17 04:20:52
330,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, love",Things to do around Anchorage in early April?,"Hi Alaskans, I read a few tourist websites( [https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/](https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/)) that recommend visiting Anchorage in March/April. I have never been to Alaska and I have been on the mid atlantic since forever. What are your remmendations for things to do around this time of year?

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

331,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, love",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

Since we met there, we thought it would be sweet.
 
I've always been an avid xcountry skier, and she's good at both, but neither of us have ever done an overnight winter backcountry trip. We do have lots of experience in cold weather though ( lived in fbx) and we love to backpack. 

Through reccomendationa from friends, we decided to celebrate by doing a part of ressurection pass: the north entrance to Caribou Creek Cabin ( 7 -8 miles). 

I haven't seen much info on doing this part in the winter. 

Anyone have any experience with this trail? Are we being stupid going this time of year?

333,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, love",Sightseeing late September (extending work trip),"First of all, I completely understand that the last week of September means potentially rainy weather, closures, and a limit on some of the typical Alaskan experiences tourists like myself might experience in the summer months. That said, I’m in anchorage for work, the dates are set, and I plan to extend the visit with my wife (both early thirties). 

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time. 

Appreciate any guidance this group can provide. Have visited Alaska before, love it, and can’t wait to be back with my wife.",2023-08-13 20:54:47

I have an all day Kenai Fjords boat tour booked on one of the very small boats. The marine forecast has turned and we may not be able to get to Aialik Bay. My question is- do you think the benefits of a small boat tour make it worth it to keep this booking and possibly stay in Resurrection Bay? Or should I go with a larger boat that is not quite so weather dependent? I'm in it more for the wildlife possibilities, especially since the fog might make scenery visibility nil. 
But as you all know, the small boat tours are $$$ compared to the big boys and this was one of the biggest splurges of our trip.

338,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, love",Questions in advance of trip,"I’m currently planning a two-week trip to Alaska with my girlfriend (August 8-21). At the moment, specific timing is mostly up in the air, but we’re 100% planning on Denali, Seward, and some day trips near Anchorage. While the flair is mostly tongue-in-cheek - I always try to do my own research before asking questions on Reddit - I still have a few questions either based on what I’ve read or that I couldn’t find online:

* I was seeing a lot of recommendations to book things in advance, but I want to be flexible in case of inclement weather (plus, still figuring out the itinerary). That said, for a lot of the things I was looking at (flightseeing, Kenai Fjords, trains, various kayaking trips, etc.), there’s plenty of availability, even if I wanted to go tomorrow or next week. Is it still advisable to book things weeks in advance, or would a few days suffice at this point? Is there a bigger tourist spike in August?

* I’ll be doing the Skinny Raven Half on 8/20 and want to try to keep my training up. While I feel decent about running opportunities in Anchorage (within downtown or in parks), I wanted to see if there would be similar opportunities near Denali or Seward - I’m used to road running, but I can do paved or even trails. I figured that Seward would be easy enough to just run around downtown, but I’m a bit iffy on Denali - one idea I had was running up and down Parks Highway for a few miles, but if this is a moronic idea, I’d definitely like to know (and also understand what to expect in terms of wildlife). 

* On another note, based on what I saw from a previous post, bear spray is advisable for runs - I wanted to confirm that this is the case even in Anchorage and Seward. Already planning on no headphones, but open to other recommendations and advice from runners, since I’m so used to running in cities and city parks. 

* Finally, I’ve done some baseline research, but I’m always up for any suggestions for restaurants and breweries, anywhere between Denali and Seward - especially love unique local food and smaller neighborhood brewpubs whose products I would never find out of state. If any of you have places you want to shout out, would love to hear about it!

Thanks in advance - can’t wait to visit!",2023-07-22 16:23:23
339,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, hate",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

341,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
342,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, hate",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice?

347,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
349,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, enjoy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
350,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, enjoy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

I do photography so any related suggestions there would be great. Also, wondering about how easy it is to find fellow locals who’d be down to exploring or chilling, just curious as to the culture as well. Since, I am by myself it would be exciting to find likeminded people who enjoy outdoors and learn about Alaska with them.

355,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, enjoy",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

356,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, enjoy","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57
357,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

358,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, happy",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50
359,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, happy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
360,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, happy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

As the title states, I’m wondering if folks have any idea of work that would allow me to travel the Aleutian Islands?

Long story short, I grew up in Alaska and have since moved away. The last year or so I have been feeling the urge to swim back upstream (sorry, couldn’t resist) but would like to explore someplace new.  

I’m definitely not into working in a cannery and I don’t know how I’d fair on a fishing boat but other than those two, if I get to be outside I’m into it.

Not that it’s directly applicable but I’ve been a wildland firefighter these last eight years so hard work and weather won’t scare me off. In fact, I think I’d be most happy camping and hiking heavy loads through the wilderness.

Thanks for any suggestions!",2023-03-24 06:11:20

The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

364,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, comfortable",Which UHaul Trailer should I choose for the Alaska Highway?,"Driving the Alaska highway down to the lower 48 from AK this August. Have a 2022 Ford Escape and more specifically the 4 cylinder AWD Hybrid model. Ford advertises that I should have around 1500 lb towing capacity and that a small teardrop trailer is fine to tow. I'm looking into getting the UHaul trailer hitch installed that has a 4500 lb capacity. There are two trailers from UHaul that I think I should be comfortable to tow. I'm waffling between the 4x8 and the 5x8 enclosed trailers they have to offer. The 4x8 already weighs around 850lbs and the 5x8 listed as 900lbs. So I was thinking to be safe and within 80% of my towing capacity it only gives me between 300 - 350 lbs depending on which model I were to choose. 

My biggest question for the group is whether or not the 4x8 or 5x8 would be reasonable on the Alaska Highway. It's not my first time driving it so I do remember the steep hills, which is a cause of my concern. If there was anyone with advice weather the 5x8 would be better off than the 4x8 or vice-a-versa it would be greatly appreciated. 

  
I have already looked into possibly pulling my car via their 10ft box trailer and it comes out closer to $3k which is less appealing.

At any rate, I absolutely love your state.  Alaska truly is the last frontier and it's beauty was far greater than I anticipated.  My closest experience to you guys was Colorado but I have to say that Alaska blows Colorado out of the water.

366,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, love",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

367,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, love",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people.

368,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, love",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

369,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, love",I took a seasonal job in Seward this summer.,"I will be starting seasonal work in Seward this summer. I am beyond excited. I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).

370,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

I have been doing as much research as I can online about what would be the best path for me to take to become a Bush Pilot in God's country. Should I do my flight school here in Central VA or move to Anchorage or Fairbanks, get a welding job and take flight school there since I'll be more adjusted to the weather Alaska will have to offer during my training? I want to be apart of this community, it can sound campy and probably just spew from someone who's young and dumb (I'm 25 as of posting this) but the allure of being someone that can take hunters, researchers, hikers, campers, and guides out to difficult spots and to assist in bringing supplies to communities, helping others out, being apart of something great is constantly drumming at my soul. I am at a stage of analysis paralysis and there's contradictory information out there on which is the best path. I don't want to take a lazy route, I want to earn this and be great to myself and others, I just want to know the best way to go about it. 

Thank you for y'alls time and I hope I got the wording of this out. If it helps any extra on where I'd like to make a more permanent living, the south east to south central parts of the state is what's attractive to me as a place for home but that can change once in the motion and falling in love with another spot.

374,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
375,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

I am planning an Alaska Cruise for my parents. I've booked a Cruise and Land Tour via Princess on the Sapphire from July 20 - Aug 1, 2024. I would love to hear people's thoughts on the comments, excursions picked, and if they would swap it out for any other experiences. My parent's do not have any mobility issues, but are also in their 70s and not the most active. They could do a few miles hiking, but would nothing too adventurous and wouldn't want my Mom on uneven terrain for too long.  Also, my Mom is vegetarian.

1. Ketchikan - July 22 - 6:00 AM - 2:00 PM
   1. Saxman Native Village, Dance Performance & Totem Park via Princess
   2. Spend remaining time exploring the town and lunch (Annabelle's vs Alaska Fish House)
   3. NOTE: I would love for them to do an easy hike that would allow them to see some scenery and possibly wildlife. In an ideal world, they would do some Bear viewing tour, but those are all 400-1000 bucks, which is out of budget for this port.
   4. NOTE #2: I offered for them to do the Misty Fjords Seaplane, and because they're doing the helicopter tour and a boat tour later on, decided against it. I could persuade them if people felt strongly about it.
2. Juneau - July 23, - 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM
   1. Harv and Marv's Whale Watching Tour - 10:30 AM - 2:30 PM
   2. Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Park + Nugget Fall's
   3. Rest of time exploring Juneau with Dinner at Tracy's?
   4. NOTE: I offered doing Whale Watching + Helicopter here - but they didn't want to pack the day with too many things since it's a long trip.
3. Skagway - July 24 - 7:00 AM - 8:30 PM
   1. TEMSCO Glacier Helicopter Tour - one benefit of this is that if it gets canceled due to weather, they could be rescheduled for the Denali Helicopter Tour later on
   2. Some other activity? - Klondike Summit/Suspension Bridge?
4. Mt. McKinley Wilderness Lodge (nearest excursion site is Talkeetna?) - July 27 afternoon through July 29 morning
   1. Mahay's Riverboat Devil's Canyon Adventure
   2. NOTE: I offered doing Talkeetna Air Taxi's flightseeing tour - but I think they want a Helicopter.
   3. Not sure what else can really do here
5. Denali Princess Wilderness Lodge - July 29 afternoon - July 31 AM
   1. Included Denali Natural History Tour - Upgrade to Tundra Wilderness vs Kantishna
   2. Not sure if there's something to fit in July 29 afternoon

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

383,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, love",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

Since we met there, we thought it would be sweet.
 
I've always been an avid xcountry skier, and she's good at both, but neither of us have ever done an overnight winter backcountry trip. We do have lots of experience in cold weather though ( lived in fbx) and we love to backpack. 

Through reccomendationa from friends, we decided to celebrate by doing a part of ressurection pass: the north entrance to Caribou Creek Cabin ( 7 -8 miles). 

I haven't seen much info on doing this part in the winter. 

Anyone have any experience with this trail? Are we being stupid going this time of year?

So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57
386,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, love",Sightseeing late September (extending work trip),"First of all, I completely understand that the last week of September means potentially rainy weather, closures, and a limit on some of the typical Alaskan experiences tourists like myself might experience in the summer months. That said, I’m in anchorage for work, the dates are set, and I plan to extend the visit with my wife (both early thirties). 

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time. 

Appreciate any guidance this group can provide. Have visited Alaska before, love it, and can’t wait to be back with my wife.",2023-08-13 20:54:47

I have an all day Kenai Fjords boat tour booked on one of the very small boats. The marine forecast has turned and we may not be able to get to Aialik Bay. My question is- do you think the benefits of a small boat tour make it worth it to keep this booking and possibly stay in Resurrection Bay? Or should I go with a larger boat that is not quite so weather dependent? I'm in it more for the wildlife possibilities, especially since the fog might make scenery visibility nil. 
But as you all know, the small boat tours are $$$ compared to the big boys and this was one of the biggest splurges of our trip.

391,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, love",Questions in advance of trip,"I’m currently planning a two-week trip to Alaska with my girlfriend (August 8-21). At the moment, specific timing is mostly up in the air, but we’re 100% planning on Denali, Seward, and some day trips near Anchorage. While the flair is mostly tongue-in-cheek - I always try to do my own research before asking questions on Reddit - I still have a few questions either based on what I’ve read or that I couldn’t find online:

* I was seeing a lot of recommendations to book things in advance, but I want to be flexible in case of inclement weather (plus, still figuring out the itinerary). That said, for a lot of the things I was looking at (flightseeing, Kenai Fjords, trains, various kayaking trips, etc.), there’s plenty of availability, even if I wanted to go tomorrow or next week. Is it still advisable to book things weeks in advance, or would a few days suffice at this point? Is there a bigger tourist spike in August?

* I’ll be doing the Skinny Raven Half on 8/20 and want to try to keep my training up. While I feel decent about running opportunities in Anchorage (within downtown or in parks), I wanted to see if there would be similar opportunities near Denali or Seward - I’m used to road running, but I can do paved or even trails. I figured that Seward would be easy enough to just run around downtown, but I’m a bit iffy on Denali - one idea I had was running up and down Parks Highway for a few miles, but if this is a moronic idea, I’d definitely like to know (and also understand what to expect in terms of wildlife). 

* On another note, based on what I saw from a previous post, bear spray is advisable for runs - I wanted to confirm that this is the case even in Anchorage and Seward. Already planning on no headphones, but open to other recommendations and advice from runners, since I’m so used to running in cities and city parks. 

* Finally, I’ve done some baseline research, but I’m always up for any suggestions for restaurants and breweries, anywhere between Denali and Seward - especially love unique local food and smaller neighborhood brewpubs whose products I would never find out of state. If any of you have places you want to shout out, would love to hear about it!

392,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, hate",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

394,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
395,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, hate",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice?

402,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

403,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, enjoy",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
404,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, enjoy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
405,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, enjoy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

I do photography so any related suggestions there would be great. Also, wondering about how easy it is to find fellow locals who’d be down to exploring or chilling, just curious as to the culture as well.

410,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, enjoy",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57
412,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

414,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, happy",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50
415,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, happy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
416,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, happy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

As the title states, I’m wondering if folks have any idea of work that would allow me to travel the Aleutian Islands?

Long story short, I grew up in Alaska and have since moved away. The last year or so I have been feeling the urge to swim back upstream (sorry, couldn’t resist) but would like to explore someplace new.  

I’m definitely not into working in a cannery and I don’t know how I’d fair on a fishing boat but other than those two, if I get to be outside I’m into it.

Not that it’s directly applicable but I’ve been a wildland firefighter these last eight years so hard work and weather won’t scare me off. In fact, I think I’d be most happy camping and hiking heavy loads through the wilderness.

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57
420,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, annoyed",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

422,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, comfortable",Which UHaul Trailer should I choose for the Alaska Highway?,"Driving the Alaska highway down to the lower 48 from AK this August. Have a 2022 Ford Escape and more specifically the 4 cylinder AWD Hybrid model. Ford advertises that I should have around 1500 lb towing capacity and that a small teardrop trailer is fine to tow. I'm looking into getting the UHaul trailer hitch installed that has a 4500 lb capacity. There are two trailers from UHaul that I think I should be comfortable to tow. I'm waffling between the 4x8 and the 5x8 enclosed trailers they have to offer. The 4x8 already weighs around 850lbs and the 5x8 listed as 900lbs. So I was thinking to be safe and within 80% of my towing capacity it only gives me between 300 - 350 lbs depending on which model I were to choose. 

My biggest question for the group is whether or not the 4x8 or 5x8 would be reasonable on the Alaska Highway. It's not my first time driving it so I do remember the steep hills, which is a cause of my concern. If there was anyone with advice weather the 5x8 would be better off than the 4x8 or vice-a-versa it would be greatly appreciated. 

  
I have already looked into possibly pulling my car via their 10ft box trailer and it comes out closer to $3k which is less appealing.

And none of the closures have been blizzards or emergencies, just normal snowfall!

In the summer, I want to take my kids on the same trails I played on with my friends as a kid. But they are filled with homeless people, some of whom have assaulted and SA’d minors. Even supervised, it doesn’t seem like a safe place for kids.

426,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, love",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

428,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, love",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).

430,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
431,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, love",Becoming a Bush Pilot ,"Hey y'all, my name is Spencer and for a long time I've had this need to go and live in Alaska, I'm a welder and have other limited experiences with car work, plumbing, outdoors skills, hunting, fishing, and kayaking. I have been doing as much research as I can online about what would be the best path for me to take to become a Bush Pilot in God's country. Should I do my flight school here in Central VA or move to Anchorage or Fairbanks, get a welding job and take flight school there since I'll be more adjusted to the weather Alaska will have to offer during my training? I want to be apart of this community, it can sound campy and probably just spew from someone who's young and dumb (I'm 25 as of posting this) but the allure of being someone that can take hunters, researchers, hikers, campers, and guides out to difficult spots and to assist in bringing supplies to communities, helping others out, being apart of something great is constantly drumming at my soul. I am at a stage of analysis paralysis and there's contradictory information out there on which is the best path. I don't want to take a lazy route, I want to earn this and be great to myself and others, I just want to know the best way to go about it. 

Thank you for y'alls time and I hope I got the wording of this out. If it helps any extra on where I'd like to make a more permanent living, the south east to south central parts of the state is what's attractive to me as a place for home but that can change once in the motion and falling in love with another spot. 

Again thank you all for your time!",2024-04-28 20:59:03

I just got a gig bartending up in Healy for the Summer season and I don't really know what to expect. I'm excited but I don't know anyone who has done anything like this. Living in California currently. I'll be arriving in Anchorage a few days early and doing some shopping at Costco, and some other stores if you guys have any recommendations.

**Anything I should buy here specifically before I leave?**

**What should I bring that I probably am not thinking about?**

**Is it ever shorts/ flipflop weather up there?**

**To anyone that's done this, or something similar, what's the crowd like? How's day to day?**

434,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
435,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

437,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, love",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

Location: Eagle Summit, Steese Hwy  
Type: Death Investigation  
Dispatch Text:

On January 3, 2024, at 5:54 pm, the Alaska State Troopers received a report that two adults had not arrived in Circle after departing Fairbanks earlier in the day. The two had reportedly left in a vehicle on January 2, 2024. The vehicle had been spotted stuck in snow at Eagle Summit on the Steese Highway earlier in the day, however, the person that spotted the vehicle was unable to stop to check on the vehicle due to extreme weather conditions in the area. With the assistance of a DOT&PF crew, an Alaska State Trooper responded to Eagle Summit and located the vehicle on the evening of January 3rd. There were whiteout and blizzard conditions in the pass when the trooper and DOT&PF crew located the vehicle - winds were gusting to 60 miles per hour, and there were 10' drifts on the roadway. The Trooper broke the window on the vehicle and located the missing adults, both deceased, inside the vehicle. The extreme weather conditions prevented the Trooper from safely recovering the bodies, so the vehicle was secured until they could safely be recovered. Two other vehicles were assisted by DOT&PF crews that had run out of fuel or become stuck on the Steese Highway on January 3rd. On January 5, 2024, weather conditions improved, allowing a DOT&PF crew, Troopers, and a tow truck to recover the vehicle and the bodies safely. Both bodies and the vehicle were transported back to Fairbanks for positive identification and further investigation. They will both be sent to the State Medical Examiner’s Office for autopsy. No foul play is suspected at this time. The identities of the deceased will be released pending positive identification and next of kin notifications.

442,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, love",Excursion Recommendations - Planning for Parents,"Hi Everyone,

I am planning an Alaska Cruise for my parents. I've booked a Cruise and Land Tour via Princess on the Sapphire from July 20 - Aug 1, 2024. I would love to hear people's thoughts on the comments, excursions picked, and if they would swap it out for any other experiences. My parent's do not have any mobility issues, but are also in their 70s and not the most active. They could do a few miles hiking, but would nothing too adventurous and wouldn't want my Mom on uneven terrain for too long.  Also, my Mom is vegetarian.

1. Ketchikan - July 22 - 6:00 AM - 2:00 PM
   1. Saxman Native Village, Dance Performance & Totem Park via Princess
   2. Spend remaining time exploring the town and lunch (Annabelle's vs Alaska Fish House)
   3. NOTE: I would love for them to do an easy hike that would allow them to see some scenery and possibly wildlife. In an ideal world, they would do some Bear viewing tour, but those are all 400-1000 bucks, which is out of budget for this port.
   4. NOTE #2: I offered for them to do the Misty Fjords Seaplane, and because they're doing the helicopter tour and a boat tour later on, decided against it. I could persuade them if people felt strongly about it.
2. Juneau - July 23, - 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM
   1. Harv and Marv's Whale Watching Tour - 10:30 AM - 2:30 PM
   2. Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Park + Nugget Fall's
   3. Rest of time exploring Juneau with Dinner at Tracy's?
   4. NOTE: I offered doing Whale Watching + Helicopter here - but they didn't want to pack the day with too many things since it's a long trip.
3. Skagway - July 24 - 7:00 AM - 8:30 PM
   1. TEMSCO Glacier Helicopter Tour - one benefit of this is that if it gets canceled due to weather, they could be rescheduled for the Denali Helicopter Tour later on
   2. Some other activity? - Klondike Summit/Suspension Bridge?
4. Mt. McKinley Wilderness Lodge (nearest excursion site is Talkeetna?) - July 27 afternoon through July 29 morning
   1. Mahay's Riverboat Devil's Canyon Adventure
   2. NOTE: I offered doing Talkeetna Air Taxi's flightseeing tour - but I think they want a Helicopter.
   3. Not sure what else can really do here
5. Denali Princess Wilderness Lodge - July 29 afternoon - July 31 AM
   1. Included Denali Natural History Tour - Upgrade to Tundra Wilderness vs Kantishna
   2. Not sure if there's something to fit in July 29 afternoon

I appreciate any help or suggestions-  thank you!",2024-01-17 04:20:52
443,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, love",Things to do around Anchorage in early April?,"Hi Alaskans, I read a few tourist websites( [https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/](https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/)) that recommend visiting Anchorage in March/April. I have never been to Alaska and I have been on the mid atlantic since forever. What are your remmendations for things to do around this time of year?

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

444,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, love",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

Since we met there, we thought it would be sweet.
 
I've always been an avid xcountry skier, and she's good at both, but neither of us have ever done an overnight winter backcountry trip. We do have lots of experience in cold weather though ( lived in fbx) and we love to backpack. 

Through reccomendationa from friends, we decided to celebrate by doing a part of ressurection pass: the north entrance to Caribou Creek Cabin ( 7 -8 miles). 

I haven't seen much info on doing this part in the winter. 

Anyone have any experience with this trail? Are we being stupid going this time of year?

446,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, love",Sightseeing late September (extending work trip),"First of all, I completely understand that the last week of September means potentially rainy weather, closures, and a limit on some of the typical Alaskan experiences tourists like myself might experience in the summer months. That said, I’m in anchorage for work, the dates are set, and I plan to extend the visit with my wife (both early thirties). 

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time. 

Appreciate any guidance this group can provide. Have visited Alaska before, love it, and can’t wait to be back with my wife.",2023-08-13 20:54:47

I have an all day Kenai Fjords boat tour booked on one of the very small boats. The marine forecast has turned and we may not be able to get to Aialik Bay. My question is- do you think the benefits of a small boat tour make it worth it to keep this booking and possibly stay in Resurrection Bay? Or should I go with a larger boat that is not quite so weather dependent? I'm in it more for the wildlife possibilities, especially since the fog might make scenery visibility nil. 
But as you all know, the small boat tours are $$$ compared to the big boys and this was one of the biggest splurges of our trip.

451,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, love",Questions in advance of trip,"I’m currently planning a two-week trip to Alaska with my girlfriend (August 8-21). At the moment, specific timing is mostly up in the air, but we’re 100% planning on Denali, Seward, and some day trips near Anchorage. While the flair is mostly tongue-in-cheek - I always try to do my own research before asking questions on Reddit - I still have a few questions either based on what I’ve read or that I couldn’t find online:

* I was seeing a lot of recommendations to book things in advance, but I want to be flexible in case of inclement weather (plus, still figuring out the itinerary). That said, for a lot of the things I was looking at (flightseeing, Kenai Fjords, trains, various kayaking trips, etc.), there’s plenty of availability, even if I wanted to go tomorrow or next week. Is it still advisable to book things weeks in advance, or would a few days suffice at this point? Is there a bigger tourist spike in August?

* I’ll be doing the Skinny Raven Half on 8/20 and want to try to keep my training up. While I feel decent about running opportunities in Anchorage (within downtown or in parks), I wanted to see if there would be similar opportunities near Denali or Seward - I’m used to road running, but I can do paved or even trails. I figured that Seward would be easy enough to just run around downtown, but I’m a bit iffy on Denali - one idea I had was running up and down Parks Highway for a few miles, but if this is a moronic idea, I’d definitely like to know (and also understand what to expect in terms of wildlife). 

* On another note, based on what I saw from a previous post, bear spray is advisable for runs - I wanted to confirm that this is the case even in Anchorage and Seward. Already planning on no headphones, but open to other recommendations and advice from runners, since I’m so used to running in cities and city parks. 

* Finally, I’ve done some baseline research, but I’m always up for any suggestions for restaurants and breweries, anywhere between Denali and Seward - especially love unique local food and smaller neighborhood brewpubs whose products I would never find out of state. If any of you have places you want to shout out, would love to hear about it!

Thanks in advance - can’t wait to visit!",2023-07-22 16:23:23
452,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, hate",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

454,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
455,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, hate",Deaths on the Steese Highway.," 

Location: Eagle Summit, Steese Hwy  
Type: Death Investigation  
Dispatch Text:

On January 3, 2024, at 5:54 pm, the Alaska State Troopers received a report that two adults had not arrived in Circle after departing Fairbanks earlier in the day. The two had reportedly left in a vehicle on January 2, 2024. The vehicle had been spotted stuck in snow at Eagle Summit on the Steese Highway earlier in the day, however, the person that spotted the vehicle was unable to stop to check on the vehicle due to extreme weather conditions in the area. With the assistance of a DOT&PF crew, an Alaska State Trooper responded to Eagle Summit and located the vehicle on the evening of January 3rd. There were whiteout and blizzard conditions in the pass when the trooper and DOT&PF crew located the vehicle - winds were gusting to 60 miles per hour, and there were 10' drifts on the roadway. The Trooper broke the window on the vehicle and located the missing adults, both deceased, inside the vehicle. The extreme weather conditions prevented the Trooper from safely recovering the bodies, so the vehicle was secured until they could safely be recovered. Two other vehicles were assisted by DOT&PF crews that had run out of fuel or become stuck on the Steese Highway on January 3rd. On January 5, 2024, weather conditions improved, allowing a DOT&PF crew, Troopers, and a tow truck to recover the vehicle and the bodies safely. Both bodies and the vehicle were transported back to Fairbanks for positive identification and further investigation. They will both be sent to the State Medical Examiner’s Office for autopsy. No foul play is suspected at this time. The identities of the deceased will be released pending positive identification and next of kin notifications.

456,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, hate",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice?

461,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

462,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, enjoy",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
463,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, enjoy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
464,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, enjoy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

465,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, enjoy",Deaths on the Steese Highway.," 

Location: Eagle Summit, Steese Hwy  
Type: Death Investigation  
Dispatch Text:

On January 3, 2024, at 5:54 pm, the Alaska State Troopers received a report that two adults had not arrived in Circle after departing Fairbanks earlier in the day. The two had reportedly left in a vehicle on January 2, 2024. The vehicle had been spotted stuck in snow at Eagle Summit on the Steese Highway earlier in the day, however, the person that spotted the vehicle was unable to stop to check on the vehicle due to extreme weather conditions in the area. With the assistance of a DOT&PF crew, an Alaska State Trooper responded to Eagle Summit and located the vehicle on the evening of January 3rd. There were whiteout and blizzard conditions in the pass when the trooper and DOT&PF crew located the vehicle - winds were gusting to 60 miles per hour, and there were 10' drifts on the roadway. The Trooper broke the window on the vehicle and located the missing adults, both deceased, inside the vehicle. The extreme weather conditions prevented the Trooper from safely recovering the bodies, so the vehicle was secured until they could safely be recovered. Two other vehicles were assisted by DOT&PF crews that had run out of fuel or become stuck on the Steese Highway on January 3rd. On January 5, 2024, weather conditions improved, allowing a DOT&PF crew, Troopers, and a tow truck to recover the vehicle and the bodies safely. Both bodies and the vehicle were transported back to Fairbanks for positive identification and further investigation. They will both be sent to the State Medical Examiner’s Office for autopsy. No foul play is suspected at this time. The identities of the deceased will be released pending positive identification and next of kin notifications.

I’m curious if there are any day hiking tours or groups I could join. Don’t want to go meandering on long hikes alone. 

Will be in Anchorage, Denali, and Kenai. Please throw in any local recommendations on food/bars/attractions. 

I do photography so any related suggestions there would be great. Also, wondering about how easy it is to find fellow locals who’d be down to exploring or chilling, just curious as to the culture as well. Since, I am by myself it would be exciting to find likeminded people who enjoy outdoors and learn about Alaska with them.

470,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, enjoy",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

471,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, enjoy","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

Location: Eagle Summit, Steese Hwy  
Type: Death Investigation  
Dispatch Text:

On January 3, 2024, at 5:54 pm, the Alaska State Troopers received a report that two adults had not arrived in Circle after departing Fairbanks earlier in the day. The two had reportedly left in a vehicle on January 2, 2024. The vehicle had been spotted stuck in snow at Eagle Summit on the Steese Highway earlier in the day, however, the person that spotted the vehicle was unable to stop to check on the vehicle due to extreme weather conditions in the area. With the assistance of a DOT&PF crew, an Alaska State Trooper responded to Eagle Summit and located the vehicle on the evening of January 3rd. There were whiteout and blizzard conditions in the pass when the trooper and DOT&PF crew located the vehicle - winds were gusting to 60 miles per hour, and there were 10' drifts on the roadway. The Trooper broke the window on the vehicle and located the missing adults, both deceased, inside the vehicle. The extreme weather conditions prevented the Trooper from safely recovering the bodies, so the vehicle was secured until they could safely be recovered. Two other vehicles were assisted by DOT&PF crews that had run out of fuel or become stuck on the Steese Highway on January 3rd. On January 5, 2024, weather conditions improved, allowing a DOT&PF crew, Troopers, and a tow truck to recover the vehicle and the bodies safely. Both bodies and the vehicle were transported back to Fairbanks for positive identification and further investigation. They will both be sent to the State Medical Examiner’s Office for autopsy. No foul play is suspected at this time. The identities of the deceased will be released pending positive identification and next of kin notifications.

473,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

475,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, happy",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

476,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, happy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
477,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, happy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

On January 3, 2024, at 5:54 pm, the Alaska State Troopers received a report that two adults had not arrived in Circle after departing Fairbanks earlier in the day. The two had reportedly left in a vehicle on January 2, 2024. The vehicle had been spotted stuck in snow at Eagle Summit on the Steese Highway earlier in the day, however, the person that spotted the vehicle was unable to stop to check on the vehicle due to extreme weather conditions in the area. With the assistance of a DOT&PF crew, an Alaska State Trooper responded to Eagle Summit and located the vehicle on the evening of January 3rd. There were whiteout and blizzard conditions in the pass when the trooper and DOT&PF crew located the vehicle - winds were gusting to 60 miles per hour, and there were 10' drifts on the roadway. The Trooper broke the window on the vehicle and located the missing adults, both deceased, inside the vehicle. The extreme weather conditions prevented the Trooper from safely recovering the bodies, so the vehicle was secured until they could safely be recovered. Two other vehicles were assisted by DOT&PF crews that had run out of fuel or become stuck on the Steese Highway on January 3rd. On January 5, 2024, weather conditions improved, allowing a DOT&PF crew, Troopers, and a tow truck to recover the vehicle and the bodies safely. Both bodies and the vehicle were transported back to Fairbanks for positive identification and further investigation. They will both be sent to the State Medical Examiner’s Office for autopsy. No foul play is suspected at this time. The identities of the deceased will be released pending positive identification and next of kin notifications.

As the title states, I’m wondering if folks have any idea of work that would allow me to travel the Aleutian Islands?

Long story short, I grew up in Alaska and have since moved away. The last year or so I have been feeling the urge to swim back upstream (sorry, couldn’t resist) but would like to explore someplace new.  

I’m definitely not into working in a cannery and I don’t know how I’d fair on a fishing boat but other than those two, if I get to be outside I’m into it.

Not that it’s directly applicable but I’ve been a wildland firefighter these last eight years so hard work and weather won’t scare me off. In fact, I think I’d be most happy camping and hiking heavy loads through the wilderness.

Thanks for any suggestions!",2023-03-24 06:11:20
481,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, annoyed",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

484,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, comfortable",Which UHaul Trailer should I choose for the Alaska Highway?,"Driving the Alaska highway down to the lower 48 from AK this August. Have a 2022 Ford Escape and more specifically the 4 cylinder AWD Hybrid model. Ford advertises that I should have around 1500 lb towing capacity and that a small teardrop trailer is fine to tow. I'm looking into getting the UHaul trailer hitch installed that has a 4500 lb capacity. There are two trailers from UHaul that I think I should be comfortable to tow. I'm waffling between the 4x8 and the 5x8 enclosed trailers they have to offer. The 4x8 already weighs around 850lbs and the 5x8 listed as 900lbs. So I was thinking to be safe and within 80% of my towing capacity it only gives me between 300 - 350 lbs depending on which model I were to choose. 

My biggest question for the group is whether or not the 4x8 or 5x8 would be reasonable on the Alaska Highway. It's not my first time driving it so I do remember the steep hills, which is a cause of my concern. If there was anyone with advice weather the 5x8 would be better off than the 4x8 or vice-a-versa it would be greatly appreciated. 

  
I have already looked into possibly pulling my car via their 10ft box trailer and it comes out closer to $3k which is less appealing.

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

488,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, love",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).


Thank you in advanced 💜",2024-03-08 04:51:16
490,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
491,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, love",Becoming a Bush Pilot ,"Hey y'all, my name is Spencer and for a long time I've had this need to go and live in Alaska, I'm a welder and have other limited experiences with car work, plumbing, outdoors skills, hunting, fishing, and kayaking. I have been doing as much research as I can online about what would be the best path for me to take to become a Bush Pilot in God's country. Should I do my flight school here in Central VA or move to Anchorage or Fairbanks, get a welding job and take flight school there since I'll be more adjusted to the weather Alaska will have to offer during my training? I want to be apart of this community, it can sound campy and probably just spew from someone who's young and dumb (I'm 25 as of posting this) but the allure of being someone that can take hunters, researchers, hikers, campers, and guides out to difficult spots and to assist in bringing supplies to communities, helping others out, being apart of something great is constantly drumming at my soul. I am at a stage of analysis paralysis and there's contradictory information out there on which is the best path. I don't want to take a lazy route, I want to earn this and be great to myself and others, I just want to know the best way to go about it. 

Thank you for y'alls time and I hope I got the wording of this out. If it helps any extra on where I'd like to make a more permanent living, the south east to south central parts of the state is what's attractive to me as a place for home but that can change once in the motion and falling in love with another spot. 

Again thank you all for your time!",2024-04-28 20:59:03
492,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, love",Working the Summer in Denali. What should I know?,"Hi everyone, thanks for taking the time to respond.

I just got a gig bartending up in Healy for the Summer season and I don't really know what to expect. I'm excited but I don't know anyone who has done anything like this. Living in California currently. I'll be arriving in Anchorage a few days early and doing some shopping at Costco, and some other stores if you guys have any recommendations.

**Anything I should buy here specifically before I leave?**

**What should I bring that I probably am not thinking about?**

**Is it ever shorts/ flipflop weather up there?**

**To anyone that's done this, or something similar, what's the crowd like? How's day to day?**

494,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
495,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

497,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, love",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

501,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, love",Excursion Recommendations - Planning for Parents,"Hi Everyone,

I am planning an Alaska Cruise for my parents. I've booked a Cruise and Land Tour via Princess on the Sapphire from July 20 - Aug 1, 2024. I would love to hear people's thoughts on the comments, excursions picked, and if they would swap it out for any other experiences. My parent's do not have any mobility issues, but are also in their 70s and not the most active. They could do a few miles hiking, but would nothing too adventurous and wouldn't want my Mom on uneven terrain for too long.  Also, my Mom is vegetarian.

1. Ketchikan - July 22 - 6:00 AM - 2:00 PM
   1. Saxman Native Village, Dance Performance & Totem Park via Princess
   2. Spend remaining time exploring the town and lunch (Annabelle's vs Alaska Fish House)
   3. NOTE: I would love for them to do an easy hike that would allow them to see some scenery and possibly wildlife. In an ideal world, they would do some Bear viewing tour, but those are all 400-1000 bucks, which is out of budget for this port.
   4. NOTE #2: I offered for them to do the Misty Fjords Seaplane, and because they're doing the helicopter tour and a boat tour later on, decided against it. I could persuade them if people felt strongly about it.
2. Juneau - July 23, - 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM
   1. Harv and Marv's Whale Watching Tour - 10:30 AM - 2:30 PM
   2. Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Park + Nugget Fall's
   3. Rest of time exploring Juneau with Dinner at Tracy's?
   4. NOTE: I offered doing Whale Watching + Helicopter here - but they didn't want to pack the day with too many things since it's a long trip.
3. Skagway - July 24 - 7:00 AM - 8:30 PM
   1. TEMSCO Glacier Helicopter Tour - one benefit of this is that if it gets canceled due to weather, they could be rescheduled for the Denali Helicopter Tour later on
   2. Some other activity? - Klondike Summit/Suspension Bridge?
4. Mt. McKinley Wilderness Lodge (nearest excursion site is Talkeetna?) - July 27 afternoon through July 29 morning
   1. Mahay's Riverboat Devil's Canyon Adventure
   2. NOTE: I offered doing Talkeetna Air Taxi's flightseeing tour - but I think they want a Helicopter.
   3. Not sure what else can really do here
5. Denali Princess Wilderness Lodge - July 29 afternoon - July 31 AM
   1. Included Denali Natural History Tour - Upgrade to Tundra Wilderness vs Kantishna
   2. Not sure if there's something to fit in July 29 afternoon

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

503,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, love",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

I've always been an avid xcountry skier, and she's good at both, but neither of us have ever done an overnight winter backcountry trip. We do have lots of experience in cold weather though ( lived in fbx) and we love to backpack. 

Through reccomendationa from friends, we decided to celebrate by doing a part of ressurection pass: the north entrance to Caribou Creek Cabin ( 7 -8 miles).

That said, I’m in anchorage for work, the dates are set, and I plan to extend the visit with my wife (both early thirties). 

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time. 

Appreciate any guidance this group can provide. Have visited Alaska before, love it, and can’t wait to be back with my wife.",2023-08-13 20:54:47

I have an all day Kenai Fjords boat tour booked on one of the very small boats. The marine forecast has turned and we may not be able to get to Aialik Bay. My question is- do you think the benefits of a small boat tour make it worth it to keep this booking and possibly stay in Resurrection Bay? Or should I go with a larger boat that is not quite so weather dependent? I'm in it more for the wildlife possibilities, especially since the fog might make scenery visibility nil. 
But as you all know, the small boat tours are $$$ compared to the big boys and this was one of the biggest splurges of our trip.

510,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, love",Questions in advance of trip,"I’m currently planning a two-week trip to Alaska with my girlfriend (August 8-21). At the moment, specific timing is mostly up in the air, but we’re 100% planning on Denali, Seward, and some day trips near Anchorage. While the flair is mostly tongue-in-cheek - I always try to do my own research before asking questions on Reddit - I still have a few questions either based on what I’ve read or that I couldn’t find online:

* I was seeing a lot of recommendations to book things in advance, but I want to be flexible in case of inclement weather (plus, still figuring out the itinerary). That said, for a lot of the things I was looking at (flightseeing, Kenai Fjords, trains, various kayaking trips, etc.), there’s plenty of availability, even if I wanted to go tomorrow or next week. Is it still advisable to book things weeks in advance, or would a few days suffice at this point? Is there a bigger tourist spike in August?

* I’ll be doing the Skinny Raven Half on 8/20 and want to try to keep my training up. While I feel decent about running opportunities in Anchorage (within downtown or in parks), I wanted to see if there would be similar opportunities near Denali or Seward - I’m used to road running, but I can do paved or even trails. I figured that Seward would be easy enough to just run around downtown, but I’m a bit iffy on Denali - one idea I had was running up and down Parks Highway for a few miles, but if this is a moronic idea, I’d definitely like to know (and also understand what to expect in terms of wildlife). 

* On another note, based on what I saw from a previous post, bear spray is advisable for runs - I wanted to confirm that this is the case even in Anchorage and Seward. Already planning on no headphones, but open to other recommendations and advice from runners, since I’m so used to running in cities and city parks. 

* Finally, I’ve done some baseline research, but I’m always up for any suggestions for restaurants and breweries, anywhere between Denali and Seward - especially love unique local food and smaller neighborhood brewpubs whose products I would never find out of state. If any of you have places you want to shout out, would love to hear about it!

511,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, hate",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

513,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
514,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, hate",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice? 

Thanks!  ",2024-02-28 18:41:22

516,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, hate",Do Kenai Fjord Tours sellout?,We are planning our first trip to Alaska this upcoming summer and are interested in taking one of the Kenai boat tours most likely either Major Marine or Kenai Fjord Tours. They both appear to be recommended and similar in options and price points. We have a 3 day window to take the tour the last week of July during the week (not weekend). I would prefer to book a day when we know we will have good weather. I would hate to book something now and then regret we chose a bad weather day. As long as there is plenty of availability we will book a few days ahead unless there is any recommendation the tours sell out in advance. If they do tend to sell out how many days/weeks/months does that typically start.

519,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

520,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, enjoy",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
521,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, enjoy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
522,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, enjoy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

I do photography so any related suggestions there would be great. Also, wondering about how easy it is to find fellow locals who’d be down to exploring or chilling, just curious as to the culture as well. Since, I am by myself it would be exciting to find likeminded people who enjoy outdoors and learn about Alaska with them.

527,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, enjoy",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

528,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, enjoy","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57
529,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

530,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, happy",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

531,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, happy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
532,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, happy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

As the title states, I’m wondering if folks have any idea of work that would allow me to travel the Aleutian Islands?

Long story short, I grew up in Alaska and have since moved away. The last year or so I have been feeling the urge to swim back upstream (sorry, couldn’t resist) but would like to explore someplace new.  

I’m definitely not into working in a cannery and I don’t know how I’d fair on a fishing boat but other than those two, if I get to be outside I’m into it.

Not that it’s directly applicable but I’ve been a wildland firefighter these last eight years so hard work and weather won’t scare me off. In fact, I think I’d be most happy camping and hiking heavy loads through the wilderness.

Thanks for any suggestions!",2023-03-24 06:11:20
535,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, annoyed",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

536,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, comfortable",Which UHaul Trailer should I choose for the Alaska Highway?,"Driving the Alaska highway down to the lower 48 from AK this August. Have a 2022 Ford Escape and more specifically the 4 cylinder AWD Hybrid model. Ford advertises that I should have around 1500 lb towing capacity and that a small teardrop trailer is fine to tow. I'm looking into getting the UHaul trailer hitch installed that has a 4500 lb capacity. There are two trailers from UHaul that I think I should be comfortable to tow. I'm waffling between the 4x8 and the 5x8 enclosed trailers they have to offer. The 4x8 already weighs around 850lbs and the 5x8 listed as 900lbs. So I was thinking to be safe and within 80% of my towing capacity it only gives me between 300 - 350 lbs depending on which model I were to choose. 

My biggest question for the group is whether or not the 4x8 or 5x8 would be reasonable on the Alaska Highway. It's not my first time driving it so I do remember the steep hills, which is a cause of my concern. If there was anyone with advice weather the 5x8 would be better off than the 4x8 or vice-a-versa it would be greatly appreciated. 

  
I have already looked into possibly pulling my car via their 10ft box trailer and it comes out closer to $3k which is less appealing.

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

540,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, love",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

541,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, love",I took a seasonal job in Seward this summer.,"I will be starting seasonal work in Seward this summer. I am beyond excited. I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).

542,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
543,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, love",Becoming a Bush Pilot ,"Hey y'all, my name is Spencer and for a long time I've had this need to go and live in Alaska, I'm a welder and have other limited experiences with car work, plumbing, outdoors skills, hunting, fishing, and kayaking. I have been doing as much research as I can online about what would be the best path for me to take to become a Bush Pilot in God's country. Should I do my flight school here in Central VA or move to Anchorage or Fairbanks, get a welding job and take flight school there since I'll be more adjusted to the weather Alaska will have to offer during my training? I want to be apart of this community, it can sound campy and probably just spew from someone who's young and dumb (I'm 25 as of posting this) but the allure of being someone that can take hunters, researchers, hikers, campers, and guides out to difficult spots and to assist in bringing supplies to communities, helping others out, being apart of something great is constantly drumming at my soul. I am at a stage of analysis paralysis and there's contradictory information out there on which is the best path. I don't want to take a lazy route, I want to earn this and be great to myself and others, I just want to know the best way to go about it. 

Thank you for y'alls time and I hope I got the wording of this out. If it helps any extra on where I'd like to make a more permanent living, the south east to south central parts of the state is what's attractive to me as a place for home but that can change once in the motion and falling in love with another spot. 

Again thank you all for your time!",2024-04-28 20:59:03

I just got a gig bartending up in Healy for the Summer season and I don't really know what to expect. I'm excited but I don't know anyone who has done anything like this. Living in California currently. I'll be arriving in Anchorage a few days early and doing some shopping at Costco, and some other stores if you guys have any recommendations.

**Anything I should buy here specifically before I leave?**

**What should I bring that I probably am not thinking about?**

**Is it ever shorts/ flipflop weather up there?**

**To anyone that's done this, or something similar, what's the crowd like? How's day to day?**

546,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
547,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

I am planning an Alaska Cruise for my parents. I've booked a Cruise and Land Tour via Princess on the Sapphire from July 20 - Aug 1, 2024. I would love to hear people's thoughts on the comments, excursions picked, and if they would swap it out for any other experiences. My parent's do not have any mobility issues, but are also in their 70s and not the most active. They could do a few miles hiking, but would nothing too adventurous and wouldn't want my Mom on uneven terrain for too long.  Also, my Mom is vegetarian.

1. Ketchikan - July 22 - 6:00 AM - 2:00 PM
   1. Saxman Native Village, Dance Performance & Totem Park via Princess
   2. Spend remaining time exploring the town and lunch (Annabelle's vs Alaska Fish House)
   3. NOTE: I would love for them to do an easy hike that would allow them to see some scenery and possibly wildlife. In an ideal world, they would do some Bear viewing tour, but those are all 400-1000 bucks, which is out of budget for this port.
   4. NOTE #2: I offered for them to do the Misty Fjords Seaplane, and because they're doing the helicopter tour and a boat tour later on, decided against it. I could persuade them if people felt strongly about it.
2. Juneau - July 23, - 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM

3. Skagway - July 24 - 7:00 AM - 8:30 PM
   1. TEMSCO Glacier Helicopter Tour - one benefit of this is that if it gets canceled due to weather, they could be rescheduled for the Denali Helicopter Tour later on
   2. Some other activity? - Klondike Summit/Suspension Bridge?
4. Mt. McKinley Wilderness Lodge (nearest excursion site is Talkeetna?) - July 27 afternoon through July 29 morning
   1. Mahay's Riverboat Devil's Canyon Adventure
   2. NOTE: I offered doing Talkeetna Air Taxi's flightseeing tour - but I think they want a Helicopter.
   3. Not sure what else can really do here
5. Denali Princess Wilderness Lodge - July 29 afternoon - July 31 AM
   1. Included Denali Natural History Tour - Upgrade to Tundra Wilderness vs Kantishna
   2. Not sure if there's something to fit in July 29 afternoon

555,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, love",Things to do around Anchorage in early April?,"Hi Alaskans, I read a few tourist websites( [https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/](https://www.meganstarr.com/best-places-to-visit-in-april-usa/)) that recommend visiting Anchorage in March/April. I have never been to Alaska and I have been on the mid atlantic since forever. What are your remmendations for things to do around this time of year?

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

556,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, love",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

Since we met there, we thought it would be sweet.
 
I've always been an avid xcountry skier, and she's good at both, but neither of us have ever done an overnight winter backcountry trip. We do have lots of experience in cold weather though ( lived in fbx) and we love to backpack. 

Through reccomendationa from friends, we decided to celebrate by doing a part of ressurection pass: the north entrance to Caribou Creek Cabin ( 7 -8 miles). 

I haven't seen much info on doing this part in the winter. 

Anyone have any experience with this trail? Are we being stupid going this time of year?

558,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, love",Sightseeing late September (extending work trip),"First of all, I completely understand that the last week of September means potentially rainy weather, closures, and a limit on some of the typical Alaskan experiences tourists like myself might experience in the summer months. That said, I’m in anchorage for work, the dates are set, and I plan to extend the visit with my wife (both early thirties). 

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time. 

Appreciate any guidance this group can provide. Have visited Alaska before, love it, and can’t wait to be back with my wife.",2023-08-13 20:54:47

I have an all day Kenai Fjords boat tour booked on one of the very small boats. The marine forecast has turned and we may not be able to get to Aialik Bay. My question is- do you think the benefits of a small boat tour make it worth it to keep this booking and possibly stay in Resurrection Bay? Or should I go with a larger boat that is not quite so weather dependent? I'm in it more for the wildlife possibilities, especially since the fog might make scenery visibility nil. 
But as you all know, the small boat tours are $$$ compared to the big boys and this was one of the biggest splurges of our trip.

563,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, love",Questions in advance of trip,"I’m currently planning a two-week trip to Alaska with my girlfriend (August 8-21). At the moment, specific timing is mostly up in the air, but we’re 100% planning on Denali, Seward, and some day trips near Anchorage. While the flair is mostly tongue-in-cheek - I always try to do my own research before asking questions on Reddit - I still have a few questions either based on what I’ve read or that I couldn’t find online:

* I was seeing a lot of recommendations to book things in advance, but I want to be flexible in case of inclement weather (plus, still figuring out the itinerary). That said, for a lot of the things I was looking at (flightseeing, Kenai Fjords, trains, various kayaking trips, etc.), there’s plenty of availability, even if I wanted to go tomorrow or next week. Is it still advisable to book things weeks in advance, or would a few days suffice at this point? Is there a bigger tourist spike in August?

* I’ll be doing the Skinny Raven Half on 8/20 and want to try to keep my training up. While I feel decent about running opportunities in Anchorage (within downtown or in parks), I wanted to see if there would be similar opportunities near Denali or Seward - I’m used to road running, but I can do paved or even trails. I figured that Seward would be easy enough to just run around downtown, but I’m a bit iffy on Denali - one idea I had was running up and down Parks Highway for a few miles, but if this is a moronic idea, I’d definitely like to know (and also understand what to expect in terms of wildlife). 

* On another note, based on what I saw from a previous post, bear spray is advisable for runs - I wanted to confirm that this is the case even in Anchorage and Seward. Already planning on no headphones, but open to other recommendations and advice from runners, since I’m so used to running in cities and city parks. 

* Finally, I’ve done some baseline research, but I’m always up for any suggestions for restaurants and breweries, anywhere between Denali and Seward - especially love unique local food and smaller neighborhood brewpubs whose products I would never find out of state. If any of you have places you want to shout out, would love to hear about it!

Thanks in advance - can’t wait to visit!",2023-07-22 16:23:23
564,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, hate",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

566,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
567,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, hate",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice?

572,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
574,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, enjoy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
575,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, enjoy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

I do photography so any related suggestions there would be great. Also, wondering about how easy it is to find fellow locals who’d be down to exploring or chilling, just curious as to the culture as well. Since, I am by myself it would be exciting to find likeminded people who enjoy outdoors and learn about Alaska with them.

580,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, enjoy",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

581,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, enjoy","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57
582,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

583,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, happy",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50
584,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, happy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
585,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, happy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

As the title states, I’m wondering if folks have any idea of work that would allow me to travel the Aleutian Islands?

Long story short, I grew up in Alaska and have since moved away. The last year or so I have been feeling the urge to swim back upstream (sorry, couldn’t resist) but would like to explore someplace new.  

I’m definitely not into working in a cannery and I don’t know how I’d fair on a fishing boat but other than those two, if I get to be outside I’m into it.

Not that it’s directly applicable but I’ve been a wildland firefighter these last eight years so hard work and weather won’t scare me off. In fact, I think I’d be most happy camping and hiking heavy loads through the wilderness.

Thanks for any suggestions!",2023-03-24 06:11:20

Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

Have a 2022 Ford Escape and more specifically the 4 cylinder AWD Hybrid model. Ford advertises that I should have around 1500 lb towing capacity and that a small teardrop trailer is fine to tow. I'm looking into getting the UHaul trailer hitch installed that has a 4500 lb capacity. There are two trailers from UHaul that I think I should be comfortable to tow. I'm waffling between the 4x8 and the 5x8 enclosed trailers they have to offer. The 4x8 already weighs around 850lbs and the 5x8 listed as 900lbs. So I was thinking to be safe and within 80% of my towing capacity it only gives me between 300 - 350 lbs depending on which model I were to choose. 

My biggest question for the group is whether or not the 4x8 or 5x8 would be reasonable on the Alaska Highway. It's not my first time driving it so I do remember the steep hills, which is a cause of my concern. If there was anyone with advice weather the 5x8 would be better off than the 4x8 or vice-a-versa it would be greatly appreciated. 

  
I have already looked into possibly pulling my car via their 10ft box trailer and it comes out closer to $3k which is less appealing.

591,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, comfortable","Moving to Juneau, question about cars","Hi everyone! I know this is a typical “moving” post but I have received mixed responses from others on what to do about a car if moving to Juneau.

Not pulling the trigger on moving until I’ve got employment offers, but there is no question, I am for sure moving up there eventually because my fiancé will be going up there for work in a month. 

Right now I have a 2WD Buick encore, it’s completely paid off and has no issues. I have read that if moving up to Alaska it is probably best to sell it and get a 4WD car. However this is a tough financial decision for me to make because I just graduated PA school and am already in a lot of debt. And obviously the market for cars is rough and expensive at the moment. 

Any insights into how drivable Juneau is with a 2WD car? I’ve read the winters are much milder compared to other areas of Alaska and that the main concern is rain. Obviously I am going to prioritize safety over everything so if it’s really not safe to take my car up there I will just have to bite the bullet. 

Also putting a plug in here for jobs. I’m a physician assistant and right now I’m not seeing any openings in town but hoping maybe word of mouth will get me somewhere. Any leads for this are very appreciated!


UPDATE: I appreciate everyone’s thoughts on here it’s been helpful and informative. I came up for two weeks to get my bearings and find a job and I did just that(did not find a PA job yet but got a decent paying McJob, gotta start somewhere). My AWD rental was slipping and sliding on certain days however(no incidents or getting stuck) and the clearance was pretty high in some areas after a snow dumping, so that basically told me I need to sell my car cause I am not comfortable driving a 2WD like that. I’m also getting quite a lot more for my car than I thought due to inflated prices so yeah! The locals told me this was as bad as it’s gonna get icy conditions wise but I just want to be safe and get to work alright lol. Thanks again.",2023-01-19 05:30:47

593,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, love",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

595,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, love",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

596,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, love",I took a seasonal job in Seward this summer.,"I will be starting seasonal work in Seward this summer. I am beyond excited. I have never been to Alaska or worked a job near the coast. I am wondering if anyone can give me any insight on how to make the most of my time while I’m there.
What to see, utilize, expect. As a person who doesn’t drink, what is the social scene like, is there a lot to keep you busy outside of going out over the summer or is the town tiny and limited? Did you make friends easily? What are groceries like price and access wise? What is the weather like and what do you wish you would have known before you packed? What do you wish you would have seen or utilized more of or at all? Were you able to save quite a bit or was it more of a unique experience? How did you feel once your season was over? Are there any places I should check out that I won’t find on Google or Pinterest?

A little about me to help with advice-
I am in my mid 30s, coming alone and without a car. I love kayaking, hiking, cooking (and eating), reading and crafting. Although I do not drink, I do like to go out and socialize from time to time. I love unique shops, tea and reading. I love to skate and will be bringing my roller blades with me.  I’ll be working as a server from May-September and living in employee housing (Windsong Lodge- I would love to know a little more about that place too).

597,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, love",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38

I have been doing as much research as I can online about what would be the best path for me to take to become a Bush Pilot in God's country. Should I do my flight school here in Central VA or move to Anchorage or Fairbanks, get a welding job and take flight school there since I'll be more adjusted to the weather Alaska will have to offer during my training? I want to be apart of this community, it can sound campy and probably just spew from someone who's young and dumb (I'm 25 as of posting this) but the allure of being someone that can take hunters, researchers, hikers, campers, and guides out to difficult spots and to assist in bringing supplies to communities, helping others out, being apart of something great is constantly drumming at my soul. I am at a stage of analysis paralysis and there's contradictory information out there on which is the best path. I don't want to take a lazy route, I want to earn this and be great to myself and others, I just want to know the best way to go about it. 

Thank you for y'alls time and I hope I got the wording of this out. If it helps any extra on where I'd like to make a more permanent living, the south east to south central parts of the state is what's attractive to me as a place for home but that can change once in the motion and falling in love with another spot.

601,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, love","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

Trip of a lifetime!!",2023-10-02 21:49:11
602,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

604,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, love",Nome for 3 months,"Traveling with my girlfriend to Nome for her three month nursing contract, and have some questions to ask and information I want to verify.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

I am planning an Alaska Cruise for my parents. I've booked a Cruise and Land Tour via Princess on the Sapphire from July 20 - Aug 1, 2024. I would love to hear people's thoughts on the comments, excursions picked, and if they would swap it out for any other experiences. My parent's do not have any mobility issues, but are also in their 70s and not the most active. They could do a few miles hiking, but would nothing too adventurous and wouldn't want my Mom on uneven terrain for too long.  Also, my Mom is vegetarian.

1. Ketchikan - July 22 - 6:00 AM - 2:00 PM
   1. Saxman Native Village, Dance Performance & Totem Park via Princess
   2. Spend remaining time exploring the town and lunch (Annabelle's vs Alaska Fish House)
   3. NOTE: I would love for them to do an easy hike that would allow them to see some scenery and possibly wildlife. In an ideal world, they would do some Bear viewing tour, but those are all 400-1000 bucks, which is out of budget for this port.
   4. NOTE #2: I offered for them to do the Misty Fjords Seaplane, and because they're doing the helicopter tour and a boat tour later on, decided against it. I could persuade them if people felt strongly about it.
2. Juneau - July 23, - 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM
   1. Harv and Marv's Whale Watching Tour - 10:30 AM - 2:30 PM
   2. Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Park + Nugget Fall's
   3. Rest of time exploring Juneau with Dinner at Tracy's?
   4. NOTE: I offered doing Whale Watching + Helicopter here - but they didn't want to pack the day with too many things since it's a long trip.
3. Skagway - July 24 - 7:00 AM - 8:30 PM
   1. TEMSCO Glacier Helicopter Tour - one benefit of this is that if it gets canceled due to weather, they could be rescheduled for the Denali Helicopter Tour later on
   2. Some other activity? - Klondike Summit/Suspension Bridge?
4. Mt. McKinley Wilderness Lodge (nearest excursion site is Talkeetna?) - July 27 afternoon through July 29 morning
   1. Mahay's Riverboat Devil's Canyon Adventure
   2. NOTE: I offered doing Talkeetna Air Taxi's flightseeing tour - but I think they want a Helicopter.
   3. Not sure what else can really do here
5. Denali Princess Wilderness Lodge - July 29 afternoon - July 31 AM
   1. Included Denali Natural History Tour - Upgrade to Tundra Wilderness vs Kantishna
   2. Not sure if there's something to fit in July 29 afternoon

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

610,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, love",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

Since we met there, we thought it would be sweet.
 
I've always been an avid xcountry skier, and she's good at both, but neither of us have ever done an overnight winter backcountry trip. We do have lots of experience in cold weather though ( lived in fbx) and we love to backpack. 

Through reccomendationa from friends, we decided to celebrate by doing a part of ressurection pass: the north entrance to Caribou Creek Cabin ( 7 -8 miles). 

I haven't seen much info on doing this part in the winter. 

Anyone have any experience with this trail? Are we being stupid going this time of year?

Also I'd love any tips in general for back country ski trips.",2023-11-07 21:36:59
612,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, love",Sightseeing late September (extending work trip),"First of all, I completely understand that the last week of September means potentially rainy weather, closures, and a limit on some of the typical Alaskan experiences tourists like myself might experience in the summer months. That said, I’m in anchorage for work, the dates are set, and I plan to extend the visit with my wife (both early thirties). 

Only thing currently planned is aurora viewing outside of Fairbanks and a Denali flight (with glacier landing, weather permitting) out of Talkeetna. Outside of that we’ve got anywhere from 3-5 days and are debating whether we lean in to all things north of anchorage (I’ve heard good things about Matanuska) and limit the drive times OR plan time in Seward/Kenai Fiords National Park. We love wildlife but my gut tells me we just may be a little late in the season for the prime wildlife watching experiences in that area. Would not be mad at fishing either but again, not sure if we’re there at the right time. 

Appreciate any guidance this group can provide. Have visited Alaska before, love it, and can’t wait to be back with my wife.",2023-08-13 20:54:47

I have an all day Kenai Fjords boat tour booked on one of the very small boats. The marine forecast has turned and we may not be able to get to Aialik Bay. My question is- do you think the benefits of a small boat tour make it worth it to keep this booking and possibly stay in Resurrection Bay? Or should I go with a larger boat that is not quite so weather dependent? I'm in it more for the wildlife possibilities, especially since the fog might make scenery visibility nil. 
But as you all know, the small boat tours are $$$ compared to the big boys and this was one of the biggest splurges of our trip.

617,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, love",Questions in advance of trip,"I’m currently planning a two-week trip to Alaska with my girlfriend (August 8-21). At the moment, specific timing is mostly up in the air, but we’re 100% planning on Denali, Seward, and some day trips near Anchorage. While the flair is mostly tongue-in-cheek - I always try to do my own research before asking questions on Reddit - I still have a few questions either based on what I’ve read or that I couldn’t find online:

* I was seeing a lot of recommendations to book things in advance, but I want to be flexible in case of inclement weather (plus, still figuring out the itinerary). That said, for a lot of the things I was looking at (flightseeing, Kenai Fjords, trains, various kayaking trips, etc.), there’s plenty of availability, even if I wanted to go tomorrow or next week. Is it still advisable to book things weeks in advance, or would a few days suffice at this point? Is there a bigger tourist spike in August?

* I’ll be doing the Skinny Raven Half on 8/20 and want to try to keep my training up. While I feel decent about running opportunities in Anchorage (within downtown or in parks), I wanted to see if there would be similar opportunities near Denali or Seward - I’m used to road running, but I can do paved or even trails. I figured that Seward would be easy enough to just run around downtown, but I’m a bit iffy on Denali - one idea I had was running up and down Parks Highway for a few miles, but if this is a moronic idea, I’d definitely like to know (and also understand what to expect in terms of wildlife). 

* On another note, based on what I saw from a previous post, bear spray is advisable for runs - I wanted to confirm that this is the case even in Anchorage and Seward. Already planning on no headphones, but open to other recommendations and advice from runners, since I’m so used to running in cities and city parks. 

* Finally, I’ve done some baseline research, but I’m always up for any suggestions for restaurants and breweries, anywhere between Denali and Seward - especially love unique local food and smaller neighborhood brewpubs whose products I would never find out of state. If any of you have places you want to shout out, would love to hear about it!

Thanks in advance - can’t wait to visit!",2023-07-22 16:23:23
618,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, hate",Car shopping,"Hi friends!
I will be moving to Anchorage with my husband and 85-lb dog in August and we are looking at trading my Kia soul in for something more durable before we drive up and I’d love some insight. I’ve lived in Florida my whole life and have no concept of Anchorage weather and wildlife. 

My main question is for Jeep owners- how often are you guys taking the top off up in Alaska?

Our top choices are the Bronco and the Subaru Outback Wilderness. I know the Outback is the practical choice, but the Bronco is my dream car lol.

 I hate myself for being hung up on two details of the Bronco and wish I didn’t care so much about:
1. the ability to remove the top and doors
2. The way the back of the bronco opens- I love that it’s a door that swings out and I’ve seen cool additions that people have added like a fold down table top to the back door- we’d make great use of that for sure. 

I have always wanted a convertible and I will have this car until it dies. I have never owned a convertible though so I don’t know how often people actually take the tops off of them. But if it’s not something I can even USE in Anchorage with the weather and wildlife, then I want to take that into consideration.  We love to hike and fish and camp and be outdoors.

620,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
621,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, hate",Moving to Bristol Bay area and need advice,"Hi all! 

Recently I was offered an internship position in the Bristol Bay area, specifically Dillingham, AK working in environmental public health. The internship roles and responsibilities are everything I'm looking for to start my career, I'm just very hesitant and scared to move to such a remote location. I've done big moves in the past, but nothing as extreme as moving somewhere with no roads, bad phone and internet service, and no access to even a Walmart. I feel that this would be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, working with the villages and Alaskan tribes to improve community health. I'm just incredibly scared to accept and hate the area. 

Can anyone give me details about the area? I know it's primarily a fishing hub with no access to traditionally urban stuff like shops and technology, but I really want more info on the culture and area. How hard is it to get to hiking areas, if there are any hiking areas? What do the people in this area do for fun? Is everyone fairly friendly and what type of age demographics live out there? During the summer, I'm assuming this is the time of nearly 24 hours of sun, but I've also read/heard this area is very cloudy with lots of rain, how true is that? How cold does it get? Does the remote location start to drain social energy from the area or is the community pretty active? 

I know that's a lot of questions, I've also read other posts related to this question with the overall consensus that living in the Bristol Bay area is not for the faint of heart. Personally, I can endure the cold, the wilderness, the wildlife, rain/weather, but I'm just not sure how I'm going to adapt to the isolation. Any tips or advice?

626,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, enjoy",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

627,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, enjoy",I love you Alaska. Thanks!,"**Hey all, just dropping by to tell you how much I loved your state.**  
(Long post ahead—warning)

My friend and I spent 12 days in southcentral Alaska, and it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. So much so that I felt the need to come here and write a post to share this experience, [some photos](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and take the opportunity to thank some amazing and friendly people we met along the way.

So yeah, we really prepared a lot for this trip—read tons of guides and info, and planned accordingly. I feel especially lucky about how this trip came to be. We scored two cheap flights to the US (NY), but since we love hiking, nature, and wildlife, we started looking at different options away from Manhattan (Glacier NP, Yellowstone, Yosemite, Washington State, Banff and Jasper NP, etc). We were almost set on Yellowstone and Grand Teton, but then someone on Reddit suggested an Alaska cruise to me. Holy shit, thank you u/bozbaby103!! We ended up not doing a cruise, but this put Alaska on our radar, so we researched it and it seemed amazing. So, we got flight tickets.

**Getting there**  
I should probably start by telling you that we came from Argentina, over 13,000 km (8,000 miles) away from Anchorage. So yeah, we had a long trip ahead. The tickets we got were to NY with a layover in Miami. The cheapest way we found to get from NY to Anchorage was through Dallas, but when we got to NY, the flight to Dallas was delayed, so they changed our flight to a probably better option—we ended up flying to Seattle, and from Seattle to Anchorage. After around 28 hours of flying and layovers, we arrived in Anchorage only one hour later than originally planned. Not only did that work out, but the last flight from Seattle to Anchorage was at night, and we got to see the Aurora from the plane for over an hour—a first for both of us. The Northern Lights were the most amazing welcome we could hope for from your state.

**Day 1**  
We arrived in Anchorage at midnight, picked up our Turo rental car (we had our concerns since we had never used Turo before, but it was a great experience), and went to our hotel to get some sleep. By 8 AM, we were on the road, as we had to be in Seward by 11 AM for our cruise. The drive from Anchorage to Seward was already breathtaking—so beautiful! And the weather? We were expecting overcast or even rain, but that morning was blue skies, beautiful light, and warm sun. We took a 6-hour Major Marine Tours cruise and it was a blast—tons of wildlife, and we met some really friendly people.

After the cruise, we hiked the Exit Glacier loop trail since we still had daylight. We had dinner at the Breeze Inn (great burgers!) and then stayed at the Nauti Otter Yurt Village—great place, great showers, and friendly hosts. Highly recommended.

**Day 2**  
We did the Harding Icefield Trail. Holy shit, this hike—absolutely beautiful and well worth the effort. The ending was just insane. Otherworldly and breathtaking.

**Day 3**  
We left Seward and headed back to Anchorage to drop off our Turo rental and pick up a campervan from Alaska Overlander. I can’t recommend this guys enough—super helpful from the start, answering tons of questions. The van we rented was from Lifestyle Overland (the Aspen)—it felt like it was prepared for anything we needed. With the Aspen in hand, we drove to Hatcher Pass and saw one of the most beautiful sunsets we’d ever witnessed. We spent the first night in the van on Fishook-Willow Rd—amazing stuff.

**Day 4**  
We headed to Talkeetna and took the Grand Denali with Glacier Landing tour from Talkeetna Air Taxi. Insane. I’m running out of adjectives here, but it was just incredible. After the flight, we drove along Parks Rd up to Denali National Park, which now has a special place in my heart.

**Days 5, 6, 7**  
We stayed three nights at Teklanika River Campground inside Denali NP. Every minute was heartwarming. The fall colors—wow. We didn’t plan it, but we got there at the perfect time. We joined the 70% club, meaning we didn’t see Denali, but we saw tons of wildlife: moose, caribou, Dall sheep, arctic squirrels, brown bears. Our favorite hike was the Savage Alpine Trail. The views from up there, I will probably remember those for the rest of my life.

**Days 8, 9**  
After Denali, we drove to Cantwell to start the Denali Highway. We drove a bit more than halfway the first day, finishing the next. Honestly, we couldn’t believe our eyes. The landscapes were one after the other—just breathtaking. We stopped at Alpine Creek Lodge for some coffee (they even offered it for free!) and spent the night around mile 38. The next day, we had breakfast at Tangle Lakes Lodge (super friendly staff as well, we had a nice chat with them) and did the Landmark Gap Lake Trail—a short but beautiful hike to a nice lake.

After finishing the Denali Highway, we took Richardson Highway to Valdez, stopping several times to take in more incredible landscapes. Thomson Pass and Keystone Canyon—holy shit. We arrived in Valdez just in time to have salmon and halibut at The Fat Mermaid.

**Day 10**  
A full day in Valdez. We took a canoe excursion at Valdez Glacier Lake with Alaska Guide Co, where we even walked on a huge iceberg. It was rainy but there was some sunlight, so of course, we encountered a beautiful double rainbow (oh, and I forgot to mention, we saw another one on the Denali Highway). We had coffee at The Coffee Co—the Salted Caramel Latte was probably the best latte I’ve had in my life. Alaska’s food wasn’t particularly impressive, but this coffee was something else.  
Afterward, we went to the Solomon Hatchery to see salmon, sea lions, and seagulls—really cool. We finished the day with a hike on the Solomon Gulch Trail.

**Day 11**  
We started our return trip and took the ferry from Valdez to Whittier. A kind lady in Valdez said Whittier wasn’t worth more than the 15 minutes it took to wait for the tunnel, but we did the Portage Pass Trail, and it was really beautiful! We enjoyed the sunny day at the black sand beach and even took a quick dip in the lake.  
Then we headed back to Anchorage and had dinner at Moose’s Tooth—the pizza was good, but the chicken wings took the crown for me.

**Day 12**  
On our last day, we visited the Alaska State Fair in Palmer before our evening flight. I have mixed feelings about the fair—it was so American, interesting to see, but also a so strange to us. Why so many hot tub stores?? But we had fun exploring and grabbing some food before heading to the airport.

**All in all**  
I just wanted to say thank you, Alaska. We met so many friendly, welcoming people, saw absurdly beautiful landscapes, and visited cozy small towns that made this trip unforgettable. This one was for the ages.

This year I’ve been getting into photography, mostly film, so I’ll share some of my favorite shots in a [different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fo325u/im_in_love_with_alaska_captured_on_35mm_film/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Hope you like them!

Of course, I plan to come back. I’m also curious about what other places on this planet could try to match Alaska’s immense, untamed beauty. Any recommendations are more than welcome.

Feel free to ask any questions!

It really felt like this trip couldn’t have been better, it was perfect in so many ways. It made my life better, and I will always carry a piece of Alaska with me. So yeah, thanks again. Love from Argentina.",2024-09-24 03:33:38
628,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, enjoy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
629,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, enjoy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

I do photography so any related suggestions there would be great.

634,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, enjoy",First Solo Trip to Alaska (5 Days - Late August),"I planned a solo trip to Alaska and people's descriptions of their own trips were helpful. I thought I'd share how my trip went in case it helps someone else.

**About the Trip**

* Transportation
   * Train for major distances
   * Anchorage - Uber (from the airport to the hotel; from hotel to train station)
   * Seward - Walking, free shuttle, or shuttles that came with tours
   * Talkeetna - Walking
* Activities
   * This was my first trip to Alaska and it was alone, so I relied heavily on tourist activities. Just seemed easier to get the hang of what's going on up there.
   * Each day, I tried to plan one major activity and a short mile-ish walk towards the end of the day. I found smaller activities to fill the gaps (e.g., like gold panning or another hike).
* Planning
   * I started planning in earnest in July (so a month or two out). Planning this close wasn't the best plan in general because lodging and plane tickets a lot more expensive.

**Itinerary**

Day 1

* Travel Day / Arrive in Anchorage

Day 2

* Take the train (Coastal Classic) to Seward
* Check into hotel
* Exit Glacier Hike
* Walk through Downtown Seward towards the Alaska Sea Life Center
* Alaska Sea Life Center
* Chocolate run at Sweet Darlings
* Iditarod Mile 0 Marker / Walk around that area

Day 3

* Morning Kayak on Resurrection Bay
* Gold Panning
* Two Lakes Hike (didn't finish because I got spooked by what I thought was traces of a bear lol)
* Walk down by the boats/harbor and watched a salmon run (?) - where a bunch of fish were trying to make it upstream

Day 4

* Check out of hotel
* Kenai Fjord Tour (8 hour cruise) - Lunch on boat
* Train back to Anchorage in the evening - Dinner on train

Day 5

* Take the morning train (Denali Star) to Talkeetna
* Watch planes take off and land at the airstrip and eat breakfast
* Flightseeing tour of Denali with a glacier landing
* Kick it around Talkeetna / visit  shops
* Train back to Anchorage

Day 6

* This day was supposed to be open to explore Anchorage. With no car, I was thinking about a trolley tour or walking. But I was wiped out. I stocked up on snacks at Walgreens and hung out at the hotel. I've never done that on a trip, and it was kind of nice. I didn't feel super flustered the next day with a 14+ hour travel day either.

Day 7

* Travel home

**Thoughts**

* I planned 7 days (2 travel days and 5 days for activities). 
   * That felt like enough for a first trip. But I could see how someone hardcore camping or hiking could spend a lot more time up there.
   * Someone mentioned late August was a good time to visit. It's still tourist season but school has started back, so everything was still active without being overly crowded.
   * I carried an Osprey 38L pack and a small side bag. I wasn't doing any overnight camping or long hikes, but not having to worry about pulling luggage everywhere was great.
* Really enjoyed Seward
   * Lots to do in walking distance but the free shuttle was a dependable option.
   * The Alaska Sea Life Center was cool, but I think a $32 ticket was a bit much. I think you can get tickets slightly cheaper if you get them ahead of time.
* Trains
   * If you had to choose between the train from Anchorage > Seward or Anchorage > Talkeetna, I'd take the one to Seward. This is only based on what I could see from the train, but I feel like the train to Seward takes you through a lot more scenery that you can't get to from a car.
   * I've never taken a passenger train like that before, so I was nervous. The process of catching the train was simple and quick. A few people tried to buy tickets an hour or so before a train came into Seward and they weren't able to. So maybe don't depend on trying to get tickets that last minute.
* Activities
   * The Kenai Fjord tour and Denali flightseeing tour (with the glacier landing)  are 100% worth it. I heard quite a few people say most of the whales are already gone this time of year. But we saw whales three times during the Kenai Fjord tour (including Orcas!).
   * There were some activities that I had to schedule just a few days before I went because companies had to see if there were enough people to form a group. So try to have backup activities planned just in case.
   * I've never been to a place where all the companies (for example the railroad and the tour companies) worked so closely. It made scheduling things easier; you could always ask people for help because they knew the schedules really well.
* Weather
   * Weather was great. It didn't rain at all while I was in Seward. It was really foggy one morning, but it was gorgeous and I loved it. It was a bit cloudy in Talkeetna with some breaks of sunshine, but once we got up near Denali for the flightseeing tour, it was bright and pretty.

Overall, I enjoyed myself! People were chill, food was good, and I got to try a lot of new things (train, kayak, Halibut, seeing glaciers). I've already started putting together a list of what I might try on my next trip:

* Visit the dog sled kennels
* Go fishing
* Do some longer hikes (maybe try camping for a few nights)
* Stay long enough to see the Northern lights/stargaze
* Visit Homer? Kept hearing people talk about visiting there while I was up there.
* Spend more time in near Denali.
* Before I went up there, I read a lot of mixed things about Fairbanks. When I got there, it was the same thing. So maybe I'll just go to see for myself?

Hope this helps someone out! And if there is anything I could have done differently, I'd appreciate that feedback too. I'm relatively new to solo travel and getting itinerary feedback is always helpful.

635,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, enjoy","Alaska, a trip, a new life in a new land.","Last year, I went on a long trip in Alaska, because I found a work proposition, well paid. So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57
636,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, annoying",Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It’s like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn’t expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that’s not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn’t catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter “too much pasta” in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I’m worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it’s impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It’s adorable you call drip coffee “sludge” and freeze “ice rage”. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose’s Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I’d only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn’t have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I’m not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I’d advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn’t impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I’m afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you’re not athletic like me, then you’ll probably feel like Alaska isn’t really “for” you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn’t feel welcoming to me. While I’m glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I’ve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the “off season.” That’s not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it’s not tourist season. That was unnerving.

637,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, happy",Struggling,"Im going to preface this asking for honesty without brutality, please. I’m not sure if we made a mistake…

We moved here as a family of three (me, my husband, and our 10 year old son). We are living just outside of Anchorage. We love our house and, well…

Due to my son’s abilities, he attends school in Anchorage even though we don’t actually live in town. I am so disheartened by the school system. Don’t get me wrong- I did my research and I heard what people had to say. I assumed my son’s school program would be different due to the nature of the curriculum. Dead. Wrong. These schools are the worst I’ve ever seen. I, and I can’t believe I’m typing this, am considering homeschooling. 

That said, if I homeschool, how do these parents socialize their kids when it’s -20 degrees? This is a serious question. It’s not like riding our bikes outside is an option anytime soon. I’ve heard answers like clubs and library meetups, is that really sufficient? Serious question.

And when kids are teenagers, it seems like many of them get in trouble a lot here. I know, I know, teenagers like that exist everywhere. This place feels like it breeds it-why is that?

I guess these are my major questions or concerns. The darkness doesn’t bother me. The weather, wildlife..I think if it were me and my husband we could find ourselves truly happy. It’s my son that worries us.

Thoughts? Helpful guidance?",2023-12-31 22:24:50
638,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, happy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
639,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, happy","Recently spent 10 days in your great state, here's what we did. We loved it!","Hey everyone. It's always been a dream of mine to visit Alaska, hailing from the New England I fell in love with lots of nature - as we also are treated to coastlines and mountains, just on a significantly smaller scale. I finally got to make the dream a reality, and wanted to share with you all our itinerary for the trip, and shoutout some local businesses/people that made it so awesome! Sorry, this is going to be long, I'll comment a link to some pics if you don't feel like reading

Some background info:

* We used Turo to rent a Jeep so we could drive the length of the trip. This was important to us as we really wanted to cover a large area, and do so on a more flexible timeline. 10/10 would recommend.
* I'm getting my Private Pilot's License, so Alaska became a bucket list state for new and fun reasons, we definitely wanted to check out some aviation highlights
* our OG bucket list items were
   * See Denali/walk around Denali Park
   * See the Northern Lights (we knew this would be tricky with the weather, but we waited until late September per some suggestions)
   * Fly in a Seaplane, which has just always seemed cool
   * See a bear, but not from too close ykyk

**Day 1: Arrive in Anchorage**

* we were pretty beat after a long flight, but the time difference worked in our favor and we were able to go exploring a bit, picked up the Jeep, drove around Lake Hood and checked out all the planes that are just parked like cars there's so many of them
* *shoutout* to one of the airport bar workers, Tammy, who gave me some salmon curry that she had from her lunch since I said I was excited to try Alaskan Salmon. So gracious and unnecessary - also delicious!
* **Food:** we enjoyed dinner at Seward's Folly - top notch nachos, and the salmon (yeah, I had salmon twice that day) came with some of the best season veggies I've had in a while. Y'all aren't afraid of seasoning and I like that.

**Day 2: Aviation Spotlight - Anchorage**

* today's big adventure was the seaplane, and while weather wasn't on our side to go all the way around Prince William Sound, the pilot was able to cruise us around and we saw some great glacier run offs, got a look at the Chugach range from the plane, and motored around on the water
   * *shoutout to Rusty! They were very easy to book with/work with*
* we made a point to stop in the Aviation History Museum - all the employees were so great. It was ridiculously fun to talk to all these people who are either pilots, or becoming pilots. The museum had a great depth of context to their museum, and highlighted the diversity in flying ON TOP OF all the fun Alaskan flying. Go check it out if you haven't yet, fun for the whole family and the gift shop rules.
* Went to go see A Haunting in Venice - super fun!
* **food:** Coffee at Kaladi Brothers - this place is so great *shoutout to the two dogs who hangout in the trunk of their owner's car in the parking lot. y'all are good doggos.*
* I can't remember what we did for lunch, but dinner was the Moose's Tooth and oh boy! Was that a treat. The Caesar Salad is truly perfect, we did a pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms which also ripped. Some really interesting beers, I let the server guide me in that department. For dinner we did the peanut butter slice of pie thing and blueberry cobbler. It was like a PB&J. Get two desserts when you go.

**Day 3:** **Heading to Seward**

* our plan for today was one of the long boat cruises out of Seward through the glaciers. Unfortunately there were 14 ft swells so that didn't happen. No matter, we pivoted and hiked the Harding Icefield Trail - way harder than locals imply but SO WORTH IT. We made it to the top of the cliffs, and while we struggled the whole way it was my first time seeing a glacier so I was totally moved by the experience.
* We stopped in Resurrect Art Coffee House for some nosh and to make a plan for the hike (we were dressed for a boat cruise). Really good bagel bombs - I bought a special oil painting that I'm very happy with by  **Eleanor McMahon** entitled ""**Little Cat's Feet**"". It looks like the Harding Icefield Glacier and I love it.
* Let me tell you, by September 20th, Seward is *asleep*. So many things were closed/opening much later.
* SAW THE FUCKING BEAR FROM THE CAR - HELL YEAH
* **food:** we went to Chinooks - unfortunately not our favorite by a long shot. The meal felt microwaved. Our server was amazing though, I hope Chinooks stays open just for her.
* **lodging**: we stayed in the Saurdough Lodge above one of the coffee shops (not open), which was very sweet.

**Day 4: Talkeetna/Denali Bound**

* Today we decided to take a long slow drive up to Talkeetna with a later flight booked through K2 to do the Glacier Landing on Denali
* First of all, the drive is fucking glorious (albeit there was some *loooonggg* spots of construction since we went back through Anchorage. As a tourist it was fine, if I lived there I can imagine planning an extra 30-40 mins onto your commute would get tiresome. I liked that they had a little construction pace car though! Funny!
* Talkeetna was a super cute spot, although again starting to close up shop for the season. It really didn't matter much since our main thing was the flight later on. We had a really great AirBNB and went off on our flight. (If you need an ABNB recommendation, hit me up, this place ruled).
* Totally lucked out with the weather, got to do the glacier landing AND **SEE DENALI'S PEAK** so I can die happy now. 10/10 experience. The Tokosha mountains were also glorious, we landed on Ruth's glacier and got to fly all around the range.
* the night was perfect to see the Aurora!!! So 4 days into our trip we pretty much had done what we set out to do lol. I can die even happier!
* **food:** The Brewpub!! This place is the tits. I had the shredded pork with black bean salad and potato salad. Rocked. Loved the blonde ale (mother?) and the lager as well. The vanilla ice cream for dessert was some of the best vanilla ice creams I've had ever maybe?
* Also on the way through Anchorage we stopped at **Tommy's Place** for a deliciously salty burger, super cool vibes, and well seasoned fries.

**Day 5: Talkeetna hangout**

* I was coming down with a pretty good cold at this point so we took it easy and hung out in our awesome space. After such a hectic and exciting few days it was welcome. I read ""Tip of the Iceberg"" which was some great context/history
* We did a little walk along the river. 10/10 dog-meeting
* *shoutout* to Nagley's for having some cold medicine, some good provisions, a chill cat, and some friendly-ass service!
* **food:** Mountain High Pizza! Really yummy

**Day 6: Denali National Park, and Chena ""resort""**

* We made it! It was cloudy and grey! Who cares! Your visitor center rules, it's like a walk-in diorama! The foliage is gorgeous! Here in NE we have maple and oak, so the hillsides turn very orange and red - but seeing the gold take hold of the Parks Highway had us totally transfixed. The park is very well maintained and obviously a very special place
* Arrival in Chena. Hilariously my mother-in-law bought us a paper map in case we lose GPS, we had no idea that everywhere only had one road. Totally unnecessary. The nature is gorgeous up near the hot springs
   * but the resort is not gorgeous. We were pretty upset - we spent a lot of money to go there and found things to be in a really dismal state, from the general atmosphere with the employees, to the state of the facilities (no mats near the hot springs or in the locker rooms, it was like a slip and slide, scratchy towels and linens with questionable cleanliness in the rooms, and the activity center was fairly bleak. The Aurora Viewing Room had a dirty window and folding chairs.)
* **food:** Denali Brewery for lunch - very good beer! You all do something different an interesting with your beers, it's a little more hoppy I think? Whatever it is, it's cool, and your breweries aren't afraid to take risks. To eat I tried the King Crabby, didn't love the sammy but did love the chowder. Again seasoned out of this world. Everywhere does chowder a little differently, so that was cool. Amazing blueberry pie for dessert, like, just fuckin so good. Oh and the PRETZEL. Dear God, the pretzel
* The lodge bar at Chena though was really great, our server, Kate, did a slammin' job keeping up. She was the **only server for the night, bar and room included** so things weren't *fast* but we had nowhere to be. The Thai Curry? THE THAI CURRY????? WOW. *shoutout to Kate, killin' the game.*

**Day 7: Santa's workshop**

* this is just charming as all get-out
* Reindeer Lodge place was closed, but we saw them through the fence! Very cute.
* I took pictures of an old stuffed animal I brought so I can say we saw a bear in the North Pole, because I think I'm hilarious. Then we began the long journey back.

*our goal at this point was to do a loop back to Anchorage for the final days - we thought maybe we'd stay somewhere along the highway so we didn't have to cannonball it. We decided to not do the Park's Highway again, and instead went through/on I THINK route 4? We drove through  the Delta Junction. Everything was gorgeous, but the idea of stopping on the way quickly became laughable as there was nowhere to stop. We figured the parks/scenery would encourage visitation/tourism spots. NOPE lol. We carried on :)*

* That other highway was insanely beautiful as well, maybe even more so than the Park's Highway. We were constantly stopping at the photo lookout points to take pics. Just jaw-dropping. We've never seen anything like it.
* we ended up getting a cabin air bnb in Sutton-Alpine. North Pole to Sutton-Alpine was quite a drive, but more of a pinball than a cannonball. We got to see the gorgeous Chugach range as we woke up and drank our coffees. What could be better?
* **food:** uhhh a Subway somewhere along the highway, and for dinner we went to a grocery store and got some ready-to-cook vegetables/pasta, along with snacks and canned margaritas. Do we blend in yet? *shoutout to the employee at the grocery store who had a line waiting for her when she returned from the restroom and handled it with a lotta grace!*

**Day 8: Easing back to Anchorage**

* We took it pretty easy, and left around noon to get back to Anchorage. We were staying in Merrill Airspace this time, at an AirBNB in the airport with the hopes of being able to get my hands on a yoke and say I flew in Alaska
* One of the highlights of the trip for me was the **Alaska Native Heritage Center**. This place was really intentional, lovely, and meditative. I learned a lot, but I also just had a really special time. I got some earrings, the gift shop is pricey but very worth it considering the ethics and quality. As a person who works in philanthropy, I really love all the work their doing and hope they have lots of success!
* **food:** lunch at Xalos - y'all please stop. I can't. Expensive as hell but worth it. Best Birria tacos around!
* dinner was at The Crow's Nest. Very good, great views, the wine list really stands out as the exceptional thing at the restaurant. Definitely worth it for a special occasion (like checking all the boxes on your bucket list - ayo!)

**Day 9: Fly Girl!**

* hey hey, got to fly this morning! I went from Merrill to the Knik Glacier by way of Hunter Creek. This was one of the proudest moments of my life so far! It was really special, and the scenery is just astounding.
* We stayed at right next to the Piper's Sports Bar, very cool airport hotel with lots of aviation history throughout it
* **food**: Sushi at Dami for lunch - holy shit this was good. Tempura fried oreos for dessert, too, that's just crazy! They had huge portions, great service, and everything was delicous. 10/10! *shoutout to who I think are the owners who welcomed us in for lunch!*
* I also got a pack of 9 bonbons from Aurora Chocolate as a little *treat* and call me Peggy Bundy. These are so impressive, so beautiful. *shoutout to this artist and the employees of the shop!!*
* Dinner was at Pipers and was way better than it had a right to be for a sport's bar. I honestly don't even remember what I ate, but it was crackin' good. Hummus plate was fire, too! Really soft pita.

**Final thoughts:** We went home the next morning. Thank you for such a wonderful time in your state! Overall we did about 1500 miles, hiked one big (to us) trail, saw one (1) black bear, flew in a few different kinds of planes, and even flew one myself, saw the Aurora, ate fantastic food throughout. Your scenery left a huge impression on me - I was blown away by how moving it was to be in the presence of such *big* nature. Not because it makes you feel small, although it does, but because it engenders a sense of larger scale, or some larger plan. Truly, truly it is something magical to protect. Your golden forest and mountain sides are the real gold rush, glimmering in Autumn and incredibly striking - I was really taken with the turning leaves of birch up against the black spruce pine. The way they bump up against that silvery-blue glacier runoff, and trail up the mountain until interrupted by rock and ice is just absolutely magnificent. I do believe the word majestic was invented to describe your state.

As the title states, I’m wondering if folks have any idea of work that would allow me to travel the Aleutian Islands?

Long story short, I grew up in Alaska and have since moved away. The last year or so I have been feeling the urge to swim back upstream (sorry, couldn’t resist) but would like to explore someplace new.  

I’m definitely not into working in a cannery and I don’t know how I’d fair on a fishing boat but other than those two, if I get to be outside I’m into it.

Not that it’s directly applicable but I’ve been a wildland firefighter these last eight years so hard work and weather won’t scare me off. In fact, I think I’d be most happy camping and hiking heavy loads through the wilderness.

Safety:
I felt safe and didn’t feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don’t require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won’t drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.

643,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, comfortable",Which UHaul Trailer should I choose for the Alaska Highway?,"Driving the Alaska highway down to the lower 48 from AK this August. Have a 2022 Ford Escape and more specifically the 4 cylinder AWD Hybrid model. Ford advertises that I should have around 1500 lb towing capacity and that a small teardrop trailer is fine to tow. I'm looking into getting the UHaul trailer hitch installed that has a 4500 lb capacity. There are two trailers from UHaul that I think I should be comfortable to tow. I'm waffling between the 4x8 and the 5x8 enclosed trailers they have to offer. The 4x8 already weighs around 850lbs and the 5x8 listed as 900lbs. So I was thinking to be safe and within 80% of my towing capacity it only gives me between 300 - 350 lbs depending on which model I were to choose. 

My biggest question for the group is whether or not the 4x8 or 5x8 would be reasonable on the Alaska Highway. It's not my first time driving it so I do remember the steep hills, which is a cause of my concern. If there was anyone with advice weather the 5x8 would be better off than the 4x8 or vice-a-versa it would be greatly appreciated. 

  
I have already looked into possibly pulling my car via their 10ft box trailer and it comes out closer to $3k which is less appealing.

645,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

My husband and I accepted great jobs in the Anchorage area and are moving up in August. 

I've been really excited about it, but now that we're getting close, we have had so many friends/family be super negative about it and then I also keep seeing posts here about how miserable and awful it is and I'm freaking out a bit. 

I know that it's dark/cold right now and has been for a few months and that the negativity is condensed because no one comes on the internet to say how okay and normal everything is going. 

Info about our situation:

-We've been up twice, late October and late November and loved the beauty and nature even though it was damp and we liked the friendly but kinda gritty/crusty/real vibe of the people we met. 

-The pay is great. We will have more than enough to cover the increased cost of living, rapidly pay off student loans, save up for a house, go on a sunny vacation or two in the winter and most importantly - leave if we hate it. 

-We are outdoorsy homebodies that like hiking, fishing and camping and recently picked up snowshoeing for a winter sport. We've lived all over the country, have snow driving experience, and the other jobs we were considering were actually way, way more rural even though they were in the lower 48. 

-Kinda freaked out by bears, earthquakes and avalanches but I'm sure we'll get over it.

652,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, love",Electric vs. GPS fences for dogs in Alaska,"I've got a small farm and a large livestock guardian dog who loves to run off the fox, coyotes, porcupines, moose, bears, all of it.  However, I live a few hundred yards from the highway, am on a river, and have the train tracks bordering one side of the property.  I NEED to keep the dog off the tracks.  We have a few acres so a buried fence wouldn't be the best option.  I'm also unsure of how they would work with deep snow.

Does anyone know if GPS collars work without direct supervision?   I have tried a Petsafe perimeter unit that works with a slightly customizable circumference but it did not help as our land is narrow not wide and allowed the tracks into the safezone.   I was also worried about the dog crossing the line, getting shocked, and not being able to come back without being shocked.  When he chases or tracks something, he goes wholeheartedly at fullspeed.  I currently have a Tractive collar that notifies my phone within two minutes when he goes out of my customized area, but I can't rely on it when I am not home and have been tying him up to be safe when I leave.  

Dogs get hit by the train all the time - they don't seem to realize that it's gonna kill them.  Does anyone have any recommendations to help me keep my animals alive?  Fences are out - the electric ones tangle up the moose and regular fences go under the snow.  He keeps the livestock protected and I'd like to protect him by keeping him from dangers that he doesn't realize are there.  I have the time and love to have training time with him, I just can't seem to get him to respect the boundaries of the property.  We walk the borders every day at least once, if not twice.

(a reach),"Like a dumb dummy, I forgot to save the thread I was reading (either on here or r/skAlaska) a month or so ago about god knows what- where a photographer in Alaska with extensive experience shooting in abject freezing temperatures was dropping some great advice, and invited OP to message them privately to discuss further. If you are that person, I would like to grab some advice if at all possible.

My February visit to Talkeetna is finally materializing and deposits/reservations are being made to cross some lifelong bucket list items off the list. I am a photographer, but won't pretend to have faced the weather or astral conditions I will be looking at in an Alaska winter (I'm mainly involved in concert photography and portraiture).

Outside of the standard ""you know your batteries aren't gonna last as long in the cold"" is there any specific gear or anything else advice I may not be thinking of while participating in extensive sledding, hiking and wandering, snow machining, and flight seeing from arctic-seasoned photographers?

*Also, for what it's worth, while I will certainly take some photos of the Northern Lights because I am there, I am not super into astrophotography, so I am less concerned with the Lights being the subject of photos, but definitely want to get them behind whatever my subject is when/if possible.*

***Gear specific stuff:***

*I am trying not to overpack for this trip, but I wanna make sure I capture some of this stuff and hopefully do the Northern Lights justice, if visible during my short trip. I'll be carrying my Canon r6 for anything important.. I assume a battery grip is ideal? I have two OEM batteries, but I think I may pick up a third emergency battery, or a handful of third parties.*

*Lens-wise I think I will probably bring with me a 24-105 f/4 for most everyday stuff, and pack a 70-200 f/2.8 with a 2x extender for the flightseeing, and then a nifty fifty and a 16mm f/2.8 since they are tiny, portable and faster than the zoom, so why not. I use a Godox V1 as my main flash and will be bringing that with an extra battery as some of the dog sledding will be at night too. In lieu of tripods,  I think I will pack two Joby GorillaPods.. one for the camera and one for the flash, since they are way more portable and I'll be able to secure them to weird stuff if need be.*

*I have a 15mm f/2.8 that I may throw in last second, and since if I am bringing all this stuff anyway, why not? Might make for a cool fisheye photo when dog sledding, I dunno.*",2024-11-14 19:47:24
654,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, love",A story of moving to Alaska,"For those thinking about moving to Alaska.  I got this years ago and I cleaned it up to post here. 

July 12: Moved to our new home in Alaska. It is so beautiful here. The mountains are so majestic. Can't hardly wait to see the snow covering them.

August 22:  Alaska is the most beautiful place on earth. The leaves are turning all colors with shades of red and orange. Went for a ride today through the beautiful mountains and saw two moose. They are truly magnificent. Hope it will snow soon. I love Alaska.

September 15: Moose season is almost over now. Cant imagine how anyone would want to kill such a beautiful creature. Hope it wil snow soon. I love Alaska.

October 28: It snowed last night. Woke up with everything blanketed in white. It looks like a postcard. We went outside and cleaned the snow off the steps and took turns shoveling the driveway. We had a snowball fight (I won), and when the snowplow came by, we had to shovel the driveway again. What a beautiful place. I think I'll live here for ever.

November 5th: More snow last night. Ilove it! The snow plow came by again. I love it here.

December 27: 20 below zero is not nearly as cold as most people think. Had the car towed into a garage to thaw out; must have had an old battery. Took a cab to work.

January 4: More of the white crap fell last night. I've got blisters on my hands from shoveling. I think the snow plow hides around the comer and waits until I'm done shoveling the driveway. Butthead!

Jan 22: More fricking snow. If lever get my hands on that SOB who drives that snow plow I will rip his testicles off. Dont know why they don't put more gravel on the fricken roads.

Feb 1: More white crap. Been inside for three days except for shoveling out of the driveway after that plow goes through every time. Can't go anywhere, car's stuck in a mountain of white crap. The weatherman says to expect another 10 inches of crap tonight. Do you know how many shovels full of snow that is?

Feb 16: The fricken weatherman was wrong. We got 34 inches of the white crap yesterday. At this rate it wont melt before summer. The snow plow got stuck today. The SOB came to the door to ask if he could borrow my snow shovel. After I told him I had broken six shovels already shoveling all the crap he piled into my driveway, I broke my last one over his fricken skull.

March: 2 Finally got out of the house today. Went to the store to get some food and on the way back a stupid fricken moose ran out in front of my car and I hit him. Did about $6,000.00 damage to the car. Those fricken beasts should be killed. Wish a hunter had killed them all last summer.

April 23: Took the car to the garage in town. You would not believe all the paint and window chipping from all the fricken gravel they put on the roads.

June 2: Moved toCalifornia. I cant imagine why anyone in their right mind would ever live in that God-forsaken state.of Alaska.",2023-11-04 00:27:24

She has several offers in the works that we are considering, and so we're near go time. I have a couple of questions that I'd like some opinions on here:

1) I'm looking at the most economical way for us to move up there. I know it's going to be expensive, which is fine...but I'd rather it's not any more expensive than it has to be. The area we are likely to end up in is Glennallen, and we'll be moving from eastern Oregon. What's the best way to get our crap up there? 3 bedroom house and some tools.

2) As part of all of this (and as we had planned prior to the offers being received) I am going to be driving up there in about a month and then picking up my wife in Anchorage and doing a big loop that will include the three locations we'd most likely move to (Anchorage, Fairbanks and Glennallen). This will give us some boots-on-ground sense of what we're getting into, and help at least initially identify some areas we'd like to live in. My question here is: are there any particular things you think I should look for to help us get the best sense of the areas while we're up there?

3) Finally...my wife hasn't been to AK, I've spent time out on Kodiak, and we've both lived above 7200ft in Colorado (10ft snow, below zero winter temps, 40+ miles to closest town) and in the mountains in Montana, and feel confident in our reasons for moving up there. That being said, we're also trying to really look at the pros and cons of the Glennallen are...so input on that is also welcome. I saw another thread that talked a little about this, but I welcome more input. Probably our biggest motivator is the natural environment around us...so if you have any practical experience with outdoor stuff in the Glennallen region, I'd love to hear it. Comparisons between the three areas for outdoor access/use/coolness is also welcome.

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

669,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, love",Cost to Live in Alaska,"Hey y'all. Kids and I are moving to Alaska this spring after the house sales. I've always wanted to move there since I was a kid reading Balto, Julie of the Wolves, Hatchet, My Side of the Mountain, and Island of the Blue Dolphins (know some aren't about Alaska but it's always reminded me of it for some reason).  The kids want to move also so we are all on board.

We've been redoing the house with lots of sweat equity so it sells better/for more. Getting the trucks (all 4wd)  rock solid and replacing everything on them. We've been downsizing and focusing on keeping tools and other needs vs stuff/wants/furniture. Ive homeschooled all the kids so lots of stuff. Researching by watching every YouTube homestead/fish/hunt/family video I can find, asking questions, taking notes and even watching Alaskan Costco and Grocery Hauls to see how the cost of groceries compare.

We are gardeners/farmers/homesteaders and the kids are 15-24 yrs old. Kids have grown up farming; garden, meat rabbits, pigs, dairy goats, chickens, ducks, quail, turkeys and we process our own meat as well as can; PC & WB, ferment, bake bread, make cheese, and dehydrate.

We don't like living here in TN at all. We moved here 4 years ago, after my husband passed away and I lost our farm in Ohio. I've a mortgage with a low interest rate on 3 acres here in TN.  We raise most all our food. We can afford living here but we are so unhappy and simply don't fit in here. 

 Kids can't afford to live on their own working full time    and  they want to find partners someday who work as hard as they do. I don't blame them as it's hard to find anyone with a good work ethic or people who are willing to work things out in a relationship based on what I've seen.. They were raised not to settle for red 
 flags and that relationships don't just happen...they're a give and take and no one should keep score. 

Lol, I know I sound like, ""I'm not like other girls."" right now. 

I work from home and that makes nearly all my income. The farm brings in the extra we need. I can continue working from home when we move to Alaska as long as I've internet. 

I know we will take a hit with the farm income/ animals since everyone gardens up there and there is a short season and we will not be set up the first year and will be starting over and just handling  infrastructure so to speak. We are canning up any extra veggies to  help counter that financial hit while we get established. We will be bringing some livestock babies with us; piglets, meat rabbits, Icelandics, and  quail. We are converting a trailer so they'll have housing when we get there we don't have to build and bringing our portable solar fencing with us for runs until we get a permanent space for them.

My oldest has a ""good job"" here working 12-14 hr days 6 days a week at $12 and he can just now afford an apartment and utilities on his own...as long as he was to eat ramen and doesn't meet someone. So he still lives at home and he is how we are affording to remodel the house.  I also grew up doing this so while no expert I was raised by parents who were/are and I can do enough diy to stay out of trouble.

We plan on building a small home/cabin on a few acres when we move up to Alaska. Our old farm was a tiny house on solar (but my husband who passed set it up so I'm not confident'going off grid' without a backup plan) and we had rainwater catchment as well as a spring fed pond for watering the animals. We also had a composting toilet. Ohio gets down to -10 but doesn't have the amount of snow AK does nor the constant negative temps. Ohio has a ton of humidity though and folks keep telling me Alaska is a dry snow so you don't get wet so I've my doubts about this information.  I keep thinking a freezer is dry inside but you'll still freeze to death locked in it even with your coveralls.

We also heated with wood. Bub and Sexy Beast of a Hubby cut it for us. Girls and I are not well versed on chopping wood but aren't afraid to learn. We did stack well though lol. I've also bought safety gear, a chainsaw light enough for me/the girls a big one for my moose of a son.  Figure a log splitter will equalize us in who can split wood.

I  read an article about evictions, folks not able to feed their family, cost of food has doubled and I'm having a slight panic attack and need your knowledge and experience. 

I put in our income in a cost of living and it said in order to maintain our current lifestyle (which is a very diy/self sufficient) we would need to earn an extra 35k a year!

How much are your utilities? What is the cost per kilowatt(?). How.much is water? How many in your family? How many cords per year for how many sq feet? How much is a cord of seasomed wood ( will need a years worth off the bat since wood we'd get would be wet). How much are groceries and how much of your own food do you grow/raise/harvest?

I want to connect to the grid and be on the road system cause I want to make sure we don't freeze to death or die in a snow drift and electric is not my most comfortable thing to work with plus winter means we'd still be running a generator so...maybe later once we're not building the property.
We do not have any friends here (being a widow tends to freak people out that it's contagious or they think yosomesomeu want their janky husband...heifer I had a King and this Queen doesn't settle for junk.) bit are working to build community.  We left Ohio mainly due to extended family that we have 0 contact with. 

Kids and I are on our own in every way and we are ok with that but they want healthy supportive partners  and we would love to  have friends that like bonfires, grilling out, see value in a stocked pantry, will trade you some time processing chickens or pigs for chickens or pork, don't only do things that require $ (like don't kids hike anymore? When did a date have to be an expensive restaurant? Picnics rock and it doesn't require going broke. And never hear....""Why don't you just buy meat from the grocery store?""

Am I being paranoid or is this a dream we need to put on hold longer, save up more (money from house selling is what/how we will buy land & materials up there)? I am a worrier and house goes up this spring. I get it could be cold feet but we are talking moving everything almost 5000 miles over 12 days. 

Any helpful advice and constructive criticism would be most helpful and welcome.",2023-07-24 21:10:44

We've tried a basic black plastic tub sled, an aluminum bucket sled with two suspended skis, and a snow coach. (The snow coach was the worst of the 3 rides ironically, claustrophobic + you slam your head)  

I'm wondering if I can build a sled that is flexible and contours and bends with the small hills and bumps so that you sit close to the snow and ""ride"" it up and down?   

Or maybe buy one of those Snowdogs I've seen advertised. I'm not sure. Would love to hear from others.

I plan to visit Alaska for the first time with my wife later this year during the summer months. Our high level literary would be to stay in Anchorage for a few days, train trip to Fairbanks, stay for a few more days then depart. A week total, we have been saving for two years and finally can have a vacation :) 

I've checked out the link on the side panel and found some cool places. I've also watched a few youtube videos where folks visit. Out of those I've decided to visit the following while in these places if time allows: 

Anchorage Points of Interest: 

* Alaska Wildlife conservation center
* Alaska heritage center
* Anchorage Museum
* Tony Knowles Coastal Trail
* Day trip to Talkeetna (I read that we should try the Spinach bread?)

Anchorage Food: 

* Snow City Cafe
* Firs Island Bake Shop
* The Kobuk (Im a big fan of Tea) 
* Mooses Tooth
* Glacier Brewhouse

Fairbanks Points of Interest: 

* Museum of the North
* Pioneer Park
* Ice Museum
* Fountainhead Antique Auto Museum
* Day trip to North Pole AK (Wife is a huge fan of Christmas)

Fairbanks Food: 

* Fairbanks Brewery
* Cookie Jar Resturant
* Alaska Salmon Bake

Out of what I have mentioned are there any places that you all would recommend to visit that I dont have listed here? Or do you all think any of the things I have selected are not worthy of a visit? 

My wife and I love the outdoors and hiking but she is not as able as she used to be so I need to keep our hiking on the easier side. We would both like to see a glacier but I couldnt seem to find one that I didnt have to pay a crazy amount of money to see. Also she loves animals, if possible Id like to take her somewhere she could see or bonus points pet animals like reindeer or sled dogs... she would absolutely love to see sled dogs. Id also like to get a chance to see the North lights if that happens to occur, so if you all know a good place to view them from or just to view the sunset Id appreciate that.",2023-05-12 17:37:13

I read a few posts that mentioned there will be no aurora, which is fine as I am travelling solo and probably wont be able to camp for hours for it at this time. I am more curious about other activities!

\- the website mentioned whale watching, will I be able to find any tour group/charter for gray whales? 

\- dog sledding! Will there be enough snow for it? (around anchorage)

\- railroad! will there be any lines open? preferablly passing through mountains and landscape?

\- wildlife/glaciers, I saw some group tours on Tripadvisor that can spot bears and mooses, will there be any around this time?

\- general weather for hiking/ photography, I love photographing landscape, how good is Denali for this purpose around this time? Will I be able to see some snow? How are the cloudy days?

My husband and I accepted great jobs in the Anchorage area and are moving up in August. 

I've been really excited about it, but now that we're getting close, we have had so many friends/family be super negative about it and then I also keep seeing posts here about how miserable and awful it is and I'm freaking out a bit. 

I know that it's dark/cold right now and has been for a few months and that the negativity is condensed because no one comes on the internet to say how okay and normal everything is going. 

Info about our situation:

-We've been up twice, late October and late November and loved the beauty and nature even though it was damp and we liked the friendly but kinda gritty/crusty/real vibe of the people we met. 

-The pay is great. We will have more than enough to cover the increased cost of living, rapidly pay off student loans, save up for a house, go on a sunny vacation or two in the winter and most importantly - leave if we hate it. 

-We are outdoorsy homebodies that like hiking, fishing and camping and recently picked up snowshoeing for a winter sport. We've lived all over the country, have snow driving experience, and the other jobs we were considering were actually way, way more rural even though they were in the lower 48. 

-Kinda freaked out by bears, earthquakes and avalanches but I'm sure we'll get over it.

(a reach),"Like a dumb dummy, I forgot to save the thread I was reading (either on here or r/skAlaska) a month or so ago about god knows what- where a photographer in Alaska with extensive experience shooting in abject freezing temperatures was dropping some great advice, and invited OP to message them privately to discuss further. If you are that person, I would like to grab some advice if at all possible.

My February visit to Talkeetna is finally materializing and deposits/reservations are being made to cross some lifelong bucket list items off the list. I am a photographer, but won't pretend to have faced the weather or astral conditions I will be looking at in an Alaska winter (I'm mainly involved in concert photography and portraiture).

Outside of the standard ""you know your batteries aren't gonna last as long in the cold"" is there any specific gear or anything else advice I may not be thinking of while participating in extensive sledding, hiking and wandering, snow machining, and flight seeing from arctic-seasoned photographers?

*Also, for what it's worth, while I will certainly take some photos of the Northern Lights because I am there, I am not super into astrophotography, so I am less concerned with the Lights being the subject of photos, but definitely want to get them behind whatever my subject is when/if possible.*

***Gear specific stuff:***

*I am trying not to overpack for this trip, but I wanna make sure I capture some of this stuff and hopefully do the Northern Lights justice, if visible during my short trip. I'll be carrying my Canon r6 for anything important.. I assume a battery grip is ideal? I have two OEM batteries, but I think I may pick up a third emergency battery, or a handful of third parties.*

*Lens-wise I think I will probably bring with me a 24-105 f/4 for most everyday stuff, and pack a 70-200 f/2.8 with a 2x extender for the flightseeing, and then a nifty fifty and a 16mm f/2.8 since they are tiny, portable and faster than the zoom, so why not. I use a Godox V1 as my main flash and will be bringing that with an extra battery as some of the dog sledding will be at night too. In lieu of tripods,  I think I will pack two Joby GorillaPods.. one for the camera and one for the flash, since they are way more portable and I'll be able to secure them to weird stuff if need be.*

*I have a 15mm f/2.8 that I may throw in last second, and since if I am bringing all this stuff anyway, why not? Might make for a cool fisheye photo when dog sledding, I dunno.*",2024-11-14 19:47:24

688,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, hate",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24

* **evolution** of the negative feelings: does it get better or worse, and why?
* **nature** of the negative feelings: temperature, anxiety, unknown, equipment fail, loneliness, boredom, phyiscal pain, bad smell, being dirty, being sweaty....
* **coping mechanism**: state of mind, actual improvement, ignoring your needs...

690,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, hate",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

692,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, hate","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

694,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, hate",Tips for driving in hazardous conditions.,"On the way into to town I passed 3 accidents. One of them involving around 6 cars, and busted up guardrails. 
You can avoid wrecking your and other peoples vehicals and putting other folks lives in danger by following a few tips. 
Tip 1, identify the hazardous condition. Some folks will not be able to do this until they are on the road, but there is actually a better way. If it warms up enough for stuff to thaw, and then gets cold again enough to freeze, then a light dusting of snow will make the road really slick.
Tip 2, leave early.
Tip 3, slow down.
Tip 4, feel free to let the other drivers on the road know that there is a hazard ahead by using your hazard lights. 
Tip 5, stay in one lane. Changing lanes tends to kick up the snow on the road, and blind the drivers behind you. Now it's clear that some people do not care, and just want to get to their destination as fast as possible. You do not have to care about what they want. On days like today, it is actually perfectly acceptable to drive slow in the left lane. 
Each of these accidents had officers on the road attending them. I would hate to have their job on a day like today. ",2024-02-25 00:10:37

(a reach),"Like a dumb dummy, I forgot to save the thread I was reading (either on here or r/skAlaska) a month or so ago about god knows what- where a photographer in Alaska with extensive experience shooting in abject freezing temperatures was dropping some great advice, and invited OP to message them privately to discuss further. If you are that person, I would like to grab some advice if at all possible.

My February visit to Talkeetna is finally materializing and deposits/reservations are being made to cross some lifelong bucket list items off the list. I am a photographer, but won't pretend to have faced the weather or astral conditions I will be looking at in an Alaska winter (I'm mainly involved in concert photography and portraiture).

Outside of the standard ""you know your batteries aren't gonna last as long in the cold"" is there any specific gear or anything else advice I may not be thinking of while participating in extensive sledding, hiking and wandering, snow machining, and flight seeing from arctic-seasoned photographers?

*Also, for what it's worth, while I will certainly take some photos of the Northern Lights because I am there, I am not super into astrophotography, so I am less concerned with the Lights being the subject of photos, but definitely want to get them behind whatever my subject is when/if possible.*

***Gear specific stuff:***

*I am trying not to overpack for this trip, but I wanna make sure I capture some of this stuff and hopefully do the Northern Lights justice, if visible during my short trip. I'll be carrying my Canon r6 for anything important.. I assume a battery grip is ideal? I have two OEM batteries, but I think I may pick up a third emergency battery, or a handful of third parties.*

*Lens-wise I think I will probably bring with me a 24-105 f/4 for most everyday stuff, and pack a 70-200 f/2.8 with a 2x extender for the flightseeing, and then a nifty fifty and a 16mm f/2.8 since they are tiny, portable and faster than the zoom, so why not. I use a Godox V1 as my main flash and will be bringing that with an extra battery as some of the dog sledding will be at night too. In lieu of tripods,  I think I will pack two Joby GorillaPods.. one for the camera and one for the flash, since they are way more portable and I'll be able to secure them to weird stuff if need be.*

*I have a 15mm f/2.8 that I may throw in last second, and since if I am bringing all this stuff anyway, why not? Might make for a cool fisheye photo when dog sledding, I dunno.*",2024-11-14 19:47:24

702,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, enjoy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24

I am starting a bachelor thesis for my ""Nature guiding and arctic outdoor life"" degree.  
I would like to write it about the physical discomfort and the negative emotions during long ski tours. I think maybe writing in the Alaska reddit would put me in touche with some who like arctic adventure :)   
  
I have not decided of my research question yet, but here are some questions I am interested in:

* **evolution** of the negative feelings: does it get better or worse, and why?
* **nature** of the negative feelings: temperature, anxiety, unknown, equipment fail, loneliness, boredom, phyiscal pain, bad smell, being dirty, being sweaty....
* **coping mechanism**: state of mind, actual improvement, ignoring your needs...

I am trying to collect testimonies and information to have an idea of what could be an interresting focus. My focus is long solo ski tours in cold climate (under -10 degrees), but I can for sure find interesting information in long tours with more than 1 person, and with another means of transportation - snow shoes, dogs... in remote nature.

704,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, enjoy",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

706,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, enjoy","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

We will be taking a cruise departing from Seward on April 22 so would like to spend a few days enjoying Alaska via land. We will arrive in Anchorage via plane (not booked yet) and need a bit of help planning from there.

1. To get to Seward from Anchorage it seems our only option at that time of year may be the Seward Bus Line? It looks like the Coastal Classic train doesn't run until mid May and I can't seem to find any rental cars that offer one way drop-offs..

2. If the shuttle is the only possibility, would it still be worth renting a car a trying to drive part of the route to Seward for the views? Or a different location to drive to?

3. Is the Aurora winter train trip worth taking from Anchorage to Fairbanks in mid April as the days are already quite long and chances of spotting the lights is low. I.e. are the views on that route worth it? (>$200pp one way is a hefty amount) I understand on a good day you can see mount Denali from the train..is this also possible from the road if we were to rent a car? (since the roads within the park are probably still packed with snow?)

4. Any other recommendations specific for that time of year?

My wife and I are looking to come to Alaska for a week in August after a legitimately brutal working year. We are kind of new to planning trips on our own and have done a lot of research into the dos/do nots in Alaska. That said, there really is a ton of information out there and it's becoming hard to try and choose absolute winners of activities that would also give us time to  ""smell the roses""/truly enjoy every spot we go to.

I'm more of a mountaineer than my wife but we're young (30 yo) and can handle physically arduous things barring 1v1 bear fights.

&#x200B;

1.) For a weeks trip, what are some absolute DO NOT MISS things that we should do? Alaska looks beautiful and it seems like we can't go wrong with anything

2.) Our general itinerary would be to fly to Anchorage, then drive to Denali, and then down to the Seward/Homer area. But it sounds like 1 week is not enough time to really do those places justice so we may have to end up cutting out Denali for the below reasons.

We are torn between Denali and the Kenai Peninsula. On one hand, everyone talks about Denali but we saw that there is a landslide that severely limits ground transportation in the area. We mulled over a flight tour but some have pointed out that this summer, rain and fog have made them 50/50 shots. Kenai sounds/looks amazing but compared to some of the bigger sites in Alaska, I haven't heard much about it.

3) I've always wanted to hike on a glacier and was curious as to recommendations on what would be a good one that doesn't take all day. I've heard good things about the Byron, Portage, and Matanuska glaciers that seem to be all a relatively short driving distance from Anchorage.

4) Are snow mobile/ATV tours worth it? They are heavily marketed on some sites.

If you are that person, I would like to grab some advice if at all possible.

I use a Godox V1 as my main flash and will be bringing that with an extra battery as some of the dog sledding will be at night too. In lieu of tripods,  I think I will pack two Joby GorillaPods.. one for the camera and one for the flash, since they are way more portable and I'll be able to secure them to weird stuff if need be.*

I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

719,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, dislike","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

If you are that person, I would like to grab some advice if at all possible.

My February visit to Talkeetna is finally materializing and deposits/reservations are being made to cross some lifelong bucket list items off the list. I am a photographer, but won't pretend to have faced the weather or astral conditions I will be looking at in an Alaska winter (I'm mainly involved in concert photography and portraiture).

Outside of the standard ""you know your batteries aren't gonna last as long in the cold"" is there any specific gear or anything else advice I may not be thinking of while participating in extensive sledding, hiking and wandering, snow machining, and flight seeing from arctic-seasoned photographers?

*Also, for what it's worth, while I will certainly take some photos of the Northern Lights because I am there, I am not super into astrophotography, so I am less concerned with the Lights being the subject of photos, but definitely want to get them behind whatever my subject is when/if possible.*

***Gear specific stuff:***

*I am trying not to overpack for this trip, but I wanna make sure I capture some of this stuff and hopefully do the Northern Lights justice, if visible during my short trip. I'll be carrying my Canon r6 for anything important.. I assume a battery grip is ideal? I have two OEM batteries, but I think I may pick up a third emergency battery, or a handful of third parties.*

*Lens-wise I think I will probably bring with me a 24-105 f/4 for most everyday stuff, and pack a 70-200 f/2.8 with a 2x extender for the flightseeing, and then a nifty fifty and a 16mm f/2.8 since they are tiny, portable and faster than the zoom, so why not. I use a Godox V1 as my main flash and will be bringing that with an extra battery as some of the dog sledding will be at night too. In lieu of tripods,  I think I will pack two Joby GorillaPods.. one for the camera and one for the flash, since they are way more portable and I'll be able to secure them to weird stuff if need be.*

727,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, annoying",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

729,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, annoying","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

My wife and I are looking to come to Alaska for a week in August after a legitimately brutal working year. We are kind of new to planning trips on our own and have done a lot of research into the dos/do nots in Alaska. That said, there really is a ton of information out there and it's becoming hard to try and choose absolute winners of activities that would also give us time to  ""smell the roses""/truly enjoy every spot we go to.

I'm more of a mountaineer than my wife but we're young (30 yo) and can handle physically arduous things barring 1v1 bear fights.

&#x200B;

1.) For a weeks trip, what are some absolute DO NOT MISS things that we should do? Alaska looks beautiful and it seems like we can't go wrong with anything

2.) Our general itinerary would be to fly to Anchorage, then drive to Denali, and then down to the Seward/Homer area. But it sounds like 1 week is not enough time to really do those places justice so we may have to end up cutting out Denali for the below reasons.

We are torn between Denali and the Kenai Peninsula. On one hand, everyone talks about Denali but we saw that there is a landslide that severely limits ground transportation in the area. We mulled over a flight tour but some have pointed out that this summer, rain and fog have made them 50/50 shots. Kenai sounds/looks amazing but compared to some of the bigger sites in Alaska, I haven't heard much about it.

3) I've always wanted to hike on a glacier and was curious as to recommendations on what would be a good one that doesn't take all day. I've heard good things about the Byron, Portage, and Matanuska glaciers that seem to be all a relatively short driving distance from Anchorage.

4) Are snow mobile/ATV tours worth it? They are heavily marketed on some sites.

(a reach),"Like a dumb dummy, I forgot to save the thread I was reading (either on here or r/skAlaska) a month or so ago about god knows what- where a photographer in Alaska with extensive experience shooting in abject freezing temperatures was dropping some great advice, and invited OP to message them privately to discuss further. If you are that person, I would like to grab some advice if at all possible.

My February visit to Talkeetna is finally materializing and deposits/reservations are being made to cross some lifelong bucket list items off the list. I am a photographer, but won't pretend to have faced the weather or astral conditions I will be looking at in an Alaska winter (I'm mainly involved in concert photography and portraiture).

Outside of the standard ""you know your batteries aren't gonna last as long in the cold"" is there any specific gear or anything else advice I may not be thinking of while participating in extensive sledding, hiking and wandering, snow machining, and flight seeing from arctic-seasoned photographers?

*Also, for what it's worth, while I will certainly take some photos of the Northern Lights because I am there, I am not super into astrophotography, so I am less concerned with the Lights being the subject of photos, but definitely want to get them behind whatever my subject is when/if possible.*

***Gear specific stuff:***

*I am trying not to overpack for this trip, but I wanna make sure I capture some of this stuff and hopefully do the Northern Lights justice, if visible during my short trip. I'll be carrying my Canon r6 for anything important.. I assume a battery grip is ideal? I have two OEM batteries, but I think I may pick up a third emergency battery, or a handful of third parties.*

*Lens-wise I think I will probably bring with me a 24-105 f/4 for most everyday stuff, and pack a 70-200 f/2.8 with a 2x extender for the flightseeing, and then a nifty fifty and a 16mm f/2.8 since they are tiny, portable and faster than the zoom, so why not. I use a Godox V1 as my main flash and will be bringing that with an extra battery as some of the dog sledding will be at night too. In lieu of tripods,  I think I will pack two Joby GorillaPods.. one for the camera and one for the flash, since they are way more portable and I'll be able to secure them to weird stuff if need be.*

*I have a 15mm f/2.8 that I may throw in last second, and since if I am bringing all this stuff anyway, why not? Might make for a cool fisheye photo when dog sledding, I dunno.*",2024-11-14 19:47:24

739,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, happy",TL;DR on living in/moving to Fairbanks for anyone curious,"I'm bored, and I both like talking about Fairbanks and being on Reddit, so I'm gonna give my basic thoughts on living in Fairbanks for anyone curious. There's so many ""moving to Alaska"" questions here, perhaps someone will find this useful.

**- First off, you don't wanna live here**: I really don't like how negative some Alaskans can be about people interested in living here, however, most Americans would not enjoy living in Fairbanks, chances are you as a reader fall into that group. So as cool as Alaska sounds, keep that in mind lol.

**- It has most of the basic amenities of a city**: Fairbanks ultimately a city of \~95,000 people spread out in a large metro with \~32,000 living in the city proper, its by no means a ""big city"", but it has most of the basic amenities that most cities have. Lots of food options (both fast food and restaurants, especially Thai), gyms, decent shopping, a movie theater, etc. It doesn't have a real mall like Anchorage or some other bigger things, but generally it operates like a city.

**- It has Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters**: Maybe you could get a little warmer and colder if you leave the valley, but in terms of populated areas, Fairbanks gets Alaska's hottest summers and coldest winters by far. Its regularly around 70F to 80F in the peak of summer and -10F to -20F in the peak of winter, although it can often get to as high as 90F in the summer and -50F in the winter.

**- Transport is pretty easy**: Driving in Fairbanks is pretty easy, you'll need a plugin for your car, but the driving itself isn't bad. Public transport is also pretty good, the buses are usually pretty spacious and go just about everywhere in the city proper, although they can sometimes be pretty late in the coldest parts of winter (to a certain extent everything is late if it gets cold enough). Uber and Lyft services are also pretty good here, generally you can get a ride within 10 minutes at any given time.

**- The university is the best in the state**: Some people here not from Fairbanks might shit on me for this take, but I would argue that UAF is the only university in the state with a cohesive college community. Its by far the best university in the state, it has a great research program, strong programs in most other fields, and a lot of school spirit, especially for the hockey team. Food and housing aren't amazing but there's a lot of good options in both respects off-campus. I will say though, especially if you're considering going here in the fall semester as an out of state student, be ready. You are going to be doing something you probably at least 50% hate in a place far from home that's getting colder and darker everyday. I'm really not trying to discourage out of state people from coming to UAF, but just be aware of where you're going.

**- Cost of living is expensive**: Cost of living is pretty expensive in Fairbanks, both in regards to basic commodities and housing prices. I don't have a lot more to add on this point, but this is a fact of living in Fairbanks.

**- Anchorage isn't that far**: Its as little as seven hours to drive to Anchorage from Fairbanks, and as much as the weather/road conditions/etc dictate. This may seem far if you live down south, but if you move here you'll realize its not, so if you wanna go to Anchorage for the weekend its pretty easy. You can also fly there and back for about $100 each way if cars aren't your thing. Side note though, if you move to Fairbanks, have a car, you don't 100% need to have one but it makes life a lot easier, if you can't afford one you're either a college student or can't afford to live in Fairbanks.

**- The day/night cycle varies a lot**: I kinda feel stupid including this point, because it seems like a given that you'd know this if you're considering moving here, but yet I still encounter so many people who seem to have no idea what its actually like, even though they want to abandon all their problems and come here, so I'll explain. Mid-May through the end of July is pretty much 100% light, the sun still sets kinda, but its always light out. Then comes August, you'll start to see the darkness creeping in, and not to long after the cold will follow. By September summer is as dead as dead, and you're starting to be sad, you notice every day that it gets a little darker, its starting to snow, and before you know it the Sun is barely cresting the horizon for a few hours only to leave you in darkness for another twenty. But then the reverse happens and you're happy again, unless you're actually an Alaskan and like the cold and darkness, then you're always happy.",2024-01-02 16:39:24
740,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, happy","Looking for testimonies for my bachelor thesis : negative emotions (discomfort, wanting to quit) on long cold tours in the nature","Hey!

I am starting a bachelor thesis for my ""Nature guiding and arctic outdoor life"" degree.  
I would like to write it about the physical discomfort and the negative emotions during long ski tours. I think maybe writing in the Alaska reddit would put me in touche with some who like arctic adventure :)   
  
I have not decided of my research question yet, but here are some questions I am interested in:

* **evolution** of the negative feelings: does it get better or worse, and why?
* **nature** of the negative feelings: temperature, anxiety, unknown, equipment fail, loneliness, boredom, phyiscal pain, bad smell, being dirty, being sweaty....
* **coping mechanism**: state of mind, actual improvement, ignoring your needs...

I am trying to collect testimonies and information to have an idea of what could be an interresting focus. My focus is long solo ski tours in cold climate (under -10 degrees), but I can for sure find interesting information in long tours with more than 1 person, and with another means of transportation - snow shoes, dogs... in remote nature.

741,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, happy",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

744,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, happy","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

If you are that person, I would like to grab some advice if at all possible.

My February visit to Talkeetna is finally materializing and deposits/reservations are being made to cross some lifelong bucket list items off the list. I am a photographer, but won't pretend to have faced the weather or astral conditions I will be looking at in an Alaska winter (I'm mainly involved in concert photography and portraiture).

Outside of the standard ""you know your batteries aren't gonna last as long in the cold"" is there any specific gear or anything else advice I may not be thinking of while participating in extensive sledding, hiking and wandering, snow machining, and flight seeing from arctic-seasoned photographers?

*Also, for what it's worth, while I will certainly take some photos of the Northern Lights because I am there, I am not super into astrophotography, so I am less concerned with the Lights being the subject of photos, but definitely want to get them behind whatever my subject is when/if possible.*

***Gear specific stuff:***

*I am trying not to overpack for this trip, but I wanna make sure I capture some of this stuff and hopefully do the Northern Lights justice, if visible during my short trip. I'll be carrying my Canon r6 for anything important.. I assume a battery grip is ideal? I have two OEM batteries, but I think I may pick up a third emergency battery, or a handful of third parties.*

*Lens-wise I think I will probably bring with me a 24-105 f/4 for most everyday stuff, and pack a 70-200 f/2.8 with a 2x extender for the flightseeing, and then a nifty fifty and a 16mm f/2.8 since they are tiny, portable and faster than the zoom, so why not. I use a Godox V1 as my main flash and will be bringing that with an extra battery as some of the dog sledding will be at night too. In lieu of tripods,  I think I will pack two Joby GorillaPods.. one for the camera and one for the flash, since they are way more portable and I'll be able to secure them to weird stuff if need be.*

*I have a 15mm f/2.8 that I may throw in last second, and since if I am bringing all this stuff anyway, why not? Might make for a cool fisheye photo when dog sledding, I dunno.*",2024-11-14 19:47:24

753,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, annoyed",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

755,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, annoyed","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

My wife and I are looking to come to Alaska for a week in August after a legitimately brutal working year. We are kind of new to planning trips on our own and have done a lot of research into the dos/do nots in Alaska. That said, there really is a ton of information out there and it's becoming hard to try and choose absolute winners of activities that would also give us time to  ""smell the roses""/truly enjoy every spot we go to.

I'm more of a mountaineer than my wife but we're young (30 yo) and can handle physically arduous things barring 1v1 bear fights.

&#x200B;

1.) For a weeks trip, what are some absolute DO NOT MISS things that we should do? Alaska looks beautiful and it seems like we can't go wrong with anything

2.) Our general itinerary would be to fly to Anchorage, then drive to Denali, and then down to the Seward/Homer area. But it sounds like 1 week is not enough time to really do those places justice so we may have to end up cutting out Denali for the below reasons.

We are torn between Denali and the Kenai Peninsula. On one hand, everyone talks about Denali but we saw that there is a landslide that severely limits ground transportation in the area. We mulled over a flight tour but some have pointed out that this summer, rain and fog have made them 50/50 shots. Kenai sounds/looks amazing but compared to some of the bigger sites in Alaska, I haven't heard much about it.

3) I've always wanted to hike on a glacier and was curious as to recommendations on what would be a good one that doesn't take all day. I've heard good things about the Byron, Portage, and Matanuska glaciers that seem to be all a relatively short driving distance from Anchorage.

4) Are snow mobile/ATV tours worth it? They are heavily marketed on some sites.

If you are that person, I would like to grab some advice if at all possible.

My February visit to Talkeetna is finally materializing and deposits/reservations are being made to cross some lifelong bucket list items off the list. I am a photographer, but won't pretend to have faced the weather or astral conditions I will be looking at in an Alaska winter (I'm mainly involved in concert photography and portraiture).

Outside of the standard ""you know your batteries aren't gonna last as long in the cold"" is there any specific gear or anything else advice I may not be thinking of while participating in extensive sledding, hiking and wandering, snow machining, and flight seeing from arctic-seasoned photographers?

*Also, for what it's worth, while I will certainly take some photos of the Northern Lights because I am there, I am not super into astrophotography, so I am less concerned with the Lights being the subject of photos, but definitely want to get them behind whatever my subject is when/if possible.*

*Lens-wise I think I will probably bring with me a 24-105 f/4 for most everyday stuff, and pack a 70-200 f/2.8 with a 2x extender for the flightseeing, and then a nifty fifty and a 16mm f/2.8 since they are tiny, portable and faster than the zoom, so why not. I use a Godox V1 as my main flash and will be bringing that with an extra battery as some of the dog sledding will be at night too. In lieu of tripods,  I think I will pack two Joby GorillaPods.. one for the camera and one for the flash, since they are way more portable and I'll be able to secure them to weird stuff if need be.*

763,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, comfortable",Vanning it for College in Anchorage,"I'm hoping to be attending University of Alaska Anchorage starting next fall. I've been living out of a van for 4 years (including wintering through at ski resorts in Washington). So I'm comfortable in the cold with my setup, having experienced the struggle of -20 degree nights, and cold days with little to no sun. The intention however, is to do long-term stays Fall-Spring at RV parks (I've found 3 already, right near the University that would be open for that kind of stay).   


I suppose my questions are these: during winter, how are the roads within Anchorage? I assume that like mountain towns in WA, they'd have pretty good road clearing systems. Are power outages common? This could come as a heavy hit if it's longer than a few days in a van that's generally staying hooked up all the time. What types of communal areas are generally available during the winter? Are places like coffee shops and libraries where you can hang out and study without being on campus fairly common? And any other comments you might have that may be helpful. Just for clarification purposes though, bear in mind - I am comfortably familiar with living out of a van in harsh winter conditions. Looking at record highs and lows, and average highs and lows and snow fall amounts - what's up there seems to be pretty well within the same parameters I usually operate in during the winter when living at ski resorts for the winter in the van.

766,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, comfortable",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

768,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, comfortable","Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

769,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, comfortable",Cost to Live in Alaska,"Hey y'all. Kids and I are moving to Alaska this spring after the house sales. I've always wanted to move there since I was a kid reading Balto, Julie of the Wolves, Hatchet, My Side of the Mountain, and Island of the Blue Dolphins (know some aren't about Alaska but it's always reminded me of it for some reason).  The kids want to move also so we are all on board.

We've been redoing the house with lots of sweat equity so it sells better/for more. Getting the trucks (all 4wd)  rock solid and replacing everything on them. We've been downsizing and focusing on keeping tools and other needs vs stuff/wants/furniture. Ive homeschooled all the kids so lots of stuff. Researching by watching every YouTube homestead/fish/hunt/family video I can find, asking questions, taking notes and even watching Alaskan Costco and Grocery Hauls to see how the cost of groceries compare.

We are gardeners/farmers/homesteaders and the kids are 15-24 yrs old. Kids have grown up farming; garden, meat rabbits, pigs, dairy goats, chickens, ducks, quail, turkeys and we process our own meat as well as can; PC & WB, ferment, bake bread, make cheese, and dehydrate.

We don't like living here in TN at all. We moved here 4 years ago, after my husband passed away and I lost our farm in Ohio. I've a mortgage with a low interest rate on 3 acres here in TN.  We raise most all our food. We can afford living here but we are so unhappy and simply don't fit in here. 

 Kids can't afford to live on their own working full time    and  they want to find partners someday who work as hard as they do. I don't blame them as it's hard to find anyone with a good work ethic or people who are willing to work things out in a relationship based on what I've seen.. They were raised not to settle for red 
 flags and that relationships don't just happen...they're a give and take and no one should keep score. 

Lol, I know I sound like, ""I'm not like other girls."" right now. 

I work from home and that makes nearly all my income. The farm brings in the extra we need. I can continue working from home when we move to Alaska as long as I've internet. 

I know we will take a hit with the farm income/ animals since everyone gardens up there and there is a short season and we will not be set up the first year and will be starting over and just handling  infrastructure so to speak. We are canning up any extra veggies to  help counter that financial hit while we get established. We will be bringing some livestock babies with us; piglets, meat rabbits, Icelandics, and  quail. We are converting a trailer so they'll have housing when we get there we don't have to build and bringing our portable solar fencing with us for runs until we get a permanent space for them.

My oldest has a ""good job"" here working 12-14 hr days 6 days a week at $12 and he can just now afford an apartment and utilities on his own...as long as he was to eat ramen and doesn't meet someone. So he still lives at home and he is how we are affording to remodel the house.  I also grew up doing this so while no expert I was raised by parents who were/are and I can do enough diy to stay out of trouble.

We plan on building a small home/cabin on a few acres when we move up to Alaska. Our old farm was a tiny house on solar (but my husband who passed set it up so I'm not confident'going off grid' without a backup plan) and we had rainwater catchment as well as a spring fed pond for watering the animals. We also had a composting toilet. Ohio gets down to -10 but doesn't have the amount of snow AK does nor the constant negative temps. Ohio has a ton of humidity though and folks keep telling me Alaska is a dry snow so you don't get wet so I've my doubts about this information.  I keep thinking a freezer is dry inside but you'll still freeze to death locked in it even with your coveralls.

We also heated with wood. Bub and Sexy Beast of a Hubby cut it for us. Girls and I are not well versed on chopping wood but aren't afraid to learn. We did stack well though lol. I've also bought safety gear, a chainsaw light enough for me/the girls a big one for my moose of a son.  Figure a log splitter will equalize us in who can split wood.

I  read an article about evictions, folks not able to feed their family, cost of food has doubled and I'm having a slight panic attack and need your knowledge and experience. 

I put in our income in a cost of living and it said in order to maintain our current lifestyle (which is a very diy/self sufficient) we would need to earn an extra 35k a year!

How much are your utilities? What is the cost per kilowatt(?). How.much is water? How many in your family? How many cords per year for how many sq feet? How much is a cord of seasomed wood ( will need a years worth off the bat since wood we'd get would be wet). How much are groceries and how much of your own food do you grow/raise/harvest?

I want to connect to the grid and be on the road system cause I want to make sure we don't freeze to death or die in a snow drift and electric is not my most comfortable thing to work with plus winter means we'd still be running a generator so...maybe later once we're not building the property.
We do not have any friends here (being a widow tends to freak people out that it's contagious or they think yosomesomeu want their janky husband...heifer I had a King and this Queen doesn't settle for junk.) bit are working to build community.  We left Ohio mainly due to extended family that we have 0 contact with. 

Kids and I are on our own in every way and we are ok with that but they want healthy supportive partners  and we would love to  have friends that like bonfires, grilling out, see value in a stocked pantry, will trade you some time processing chickens or pigs for chickens or pork, don't only do things that require $ (like don't kids hike anymore? When did a date have to be an expensive restaurant? Picnics rock and it doesn't require going broke. And never hear....""Why don't you just buy meat from the grocery store?""

Am I being paranoid or is this a dream we need to put on hold longer, save up more (money from house selling is what/how we will buy land & materials up there)? I am a worrier and house goes up this spring. I get it could be cold feet but we are talking moving everything almost 5000 miles over 12 days.

I have a GMC cargo van which I am perfectly comfortable living out of.  I have everything I need to keep warm and I have plenty of experience maintaining engines and vehicles in sub zero temperatures.  I also have enough money to get to Homer and ferry my van to Dutch if that's what I decide to do.  I have enough saved to live comfortably and pay for fuel/food/living expenses and extensive engine/vehicle repairs on my van if needed.  I can survive for a year and have enough to get back to main land and back to lower 48 if things don't work out.  

I have plenty of experience working 12+ hours/day in sub zero temperatures.

My dream is to work on a vessel in the Bering Sea.  I don't have much experience on boats.  Just a few fishing charters in the Atlantic in not so rough waters.

How hard would it be for me to find a greenhorn job on a commercial vessel out of Homer before I start my employment on a factory vessel in Dutch?  Any tips on how to get a job quickly when I get there?  Is it better to just go straight to Dutch and look for a job there?

I will be in Homer in 1 month.

Update:
After reading all of the comments about trawling vessels and doing a little research I’ve decided that’s not something I want to be a part of.  Probably the reason it was so easy to land that job is because they have a hard time finding people who are willing to do that type of fishing.

773,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, comfortable","Moving to Juneau, question about cars","Hi everyone! I know this is a typical “moving” post but I have received mixed responses from others on what to do about a car if moving to Juneau.

Not pulling the trigger on moving until I’ve got employment offers, but there is no question, I am for sure moving up there eventually because my fiancé will be going up there for work in a month. 

Right now I have a 2WD Buick encore, it’s completely paid off and has no issues. I have read that if moving up to Alaska it is probably best to sell it and get a 4WD car. However this is a tough financial decision for me to make because I just graduated PA school and am already in a lot of debt. And obviously the market for cars is rough and expensive at the moment. 

Any insights into how drivable Juneau is with a 2WD car? I’ve read the winters are much milder compared to other areas of Alaska and that the main concern is rain. Obviously I am going to prioritize safety over everything so if it’s really not safe to take my car up there I will just have to bite the bullet. 

Also putting a plug in here for jobs. I’m a physician assistant and right now I’m not seeing any openings in town but hoping maybe word of mouth will get me somewhere. Any leads for this are very appreciated!


UPDATE: I appreciate everyone’s thoughts on here it’s been helpful and informative. I came up for two weeks to get my bearings and find a job and I did just that(did not find a PA job yet but got a decent paying McJob, gotta start somewhere). My AWD rental was slipping and sliding on certain days however(no incidents or getting stuck) and the clearance was pretty high in some areas after a snow dumping, so that basically told me I need to sell my car cause I am not comfortable driving a 2WD like that. I’m also getting quite a lot more for my car than I thought due to inflated prices so yeah! The locals told me this was as bad as it’s gonna get icy conditions wise but I just want to be safe and get to work alright lol. Thanks again.",2023-01-19 05:30:47

776,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snowy, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

Housing is expensive! I knew, but I didn't actually *know*. Her hospital provided housing is single gender only, so we'll be looking for our own place to stay. We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

Anything else? I'll be bringing up a pocket server with more than enough media as well as blackout curtains, ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, eye covers, and sleep drugs. We've also been discussing routines to strictly stick to to stay in shape and other routines to pass time.

Thanks


----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

So I´ve been enjoying this State for 6 months. I want to share my experience with you through this blog.

&#x200B;

Alaska is a weird territory for everyone who walks on it. You can instantly see the beautiful landscapes, far mountains with permafrost, feel the danger of wild nature including fauna and flora. From the beauty of a humpback whale which is ejecting some water near an eagle which is flying to search a target for food to the danger of a white bear, Alaska is your dream and at the same time your nightmare.

In Alaska, it's a rudimentary life, because it's very wild, natives depend on hunting and fishing.

&#x200B;

You can see brown bears, moose, black bears, polar bears, cariboo, mountain goats, bison, dall sheep, orca, bald eagles, ospreys, burned puffins, humpback whales, fishes in every landscape, that’s the land of diversity. Raven, the symbol of Alaska, a long life bird, smart and stylish, represents the bipolarity of the experience of living in Alaska.

Life is logically not the same as in Europe, or in the US, you are isolated from society, have limited social relationships. Far from public transports, stores.

The climate is not the same every day, usually it’s cold, there is some wind but sometimes you can’t stand outdoor because of a windstorm, a snowstorm, overall there are some weather risks. 

Also you need to know that the day cycle is not the same in most countries in the world, the night can stay for 2 months, that’s called the polar night.

&#x200B;

Global warming has a negative impact on the fauna and the flora and unfortunately on natives who depend on their environment. Climate change, water warming, iceberg melting, forest burning, all of these impacts because of human activity and past exploitation of resources (oil, gas, …) of Alaska’s territory.

To limit the risks of the print of humans on the ecosystem, local authorities have made regulations about the fishing or the hunting, they also have created National parks to preserve animals .",2023-04-04 11:26:57

I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well. A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

I have a job lined up on a large factory trawler that operates out of Dutch.  The wait time to get on a vessel is up to 8 months.  I have a GMC cargo van which I am perfectly comfortable living out of.  I have everything I need to keep warm and I have plenty of experience maintaining engines and vehicles in sub zero temperatures.

I have enough saved to live comfortably and pay for fuel/food/living expenses and extensive engine/vehicle repairs on my van if needed.  I can survive for a year and have enough to get back to main land and back to lower 48 if things don't work out.  

I have plenty of experience working 12+ hours/day in sub zero temperatures.

My dream is to work on a vessel in the Bering Sea.  I don't have much experience on boats.  Just a few fishing charters in the Atlantic in not so rough waters.

How hard would it be for me to find a greenhorn job on a commercial vessel out of Homer before I start my employment on a factory vessel in Dutch?  Any tips on how to get a job quickly when I get there?  Is it better to just go straight to Dutch and look for a job there?

I will be in Homer in 1 month.

Update:
After reading all of the comments about trawling vessels and doing a little research I’ve decided that’s not something I want to be a part of.  Probably the reason it was so easy to land that job is because they have a hard time finding people who are willing to do that type of fishing.

A young man was picking up his sister from school and was asked for money and cigarettes and when he said that he didn't have any he was stabbed, a woman was followed home and a man broke into her home and robbed and brutally assaulted her, those are a few examples of what you may see here). Also a lot of homelessness, very sad, I try to donate to and help out the homeless when I can. To give you an idea it's similar to somewhere like Albuquerque or Phoenix in terms of crime. So probably not any worse than Anchorage given that Alaska does seem to struggle with more crime than the US average.

So you can see why I am getting sick of it here. But enough of my rant. what's it like in Alaska and what are some must see places in Alaska?

I definitely want to visit Sitka, it looks beautiful. Though Ketchikan also looks nice. And I'd love to see Glacier Bay National Park, Glaciers basically don't exist in Australia unless you include the Australian Antarctic Territory. It looks so mystical and awe-inspiring and fascinating.

Would also like to visit Anchorage. Fairbanks too. Would be interesting to see the major cities in Alaska and how people operate in them day to day.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

Seeing the northern lights would be cool, you can actually see the southern lights in Australia if you go to Tasmania during winter.

What is the food like in Alaska like? I love seafood, and I hear that Alaska has excellent fishing and crabbing. Then again maybe I'm a bit biased about seafood because Australia has excellent seafood. Some of the most exotic and flavourful fish you can find. King Snapper, Red Emperor, Coral Trout, Black Bream, Golden Trevally, Goldband Snapper, King George Whiting, Gummy Shark, Dhufish etc. Also we have a lot of good snacks like Tim Tams and Red Rock Deli potato chips. This is my YouTube channel that I do food reviews on in case anyone is interested in seeing what foods we eat in Australia-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvhA77HuSqPO74A-LHHdewQ/videos.

The culture and wildlife? Australia has some interesting wildlife. You know, like Koalas, Wombats, Kangaroos, Tasmanian Devils. I always see a lot of kangaroo when hiking in national parks and regional parks around Perth. But I've never seen a moose or bear before so that would be cool. Australia has a vibrant indigenous culture (it's amazing how they lived really. Great hunters, the instruments they played (ie the Didgeridoo) lived off some of the harshest of lands) so checking out how the native tribes of Alaska live would be really cool. I hear that they are great hunters as well and I like the lodges that they build and the clothes and art that they make.

Here are some videos that show what nature is like in WA. A lot of wetlands, they just give off such a nice vibe-https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEXVpZV9-GKyUDqCYRiEHtQ. In one of these videos I take a video of the largest and most beautiful wetland in Perth. There is also a support video on there if anyone needs any support-we are living in a pretty tough world at the moment.

But how is everyday life where you live for you in Alaska?.

Honestly it looks so beautiful but it will take a lot of saving for me to visit all of it. But I will do it, it is somewhere that I have to visit in my lifetime.

Any responses would be much appreciated, I always like talking to people from different places.

I won't be able to respond though for about another 12-14 hours as it is bedtime in my time zone at the moment.

Average temperature during April-June report lows of 16°. Is this reliable? With wind chill what should I actually be expecting? I'm in a state of constant Missouri, so I'm hoping it's not a drastic change to what I'm used to in our colder seasons. 

Is GCI the only available cell service, and am I able to instead bring in a phone with ATT service? I've read mixed posts, most years old, about what service I'll have out there. Pricing for both their phone and Internet seems expensive for what is provided, and I'd like to cut what I can.

We are looking at ""Hello Central Guest House"", though I'm hoping there are a bit cheaper options once I'm there in person. I've been recommended to check Facebook groups and community services, but wanted to know if there might be an option I'm unaware of.

----------

Update May '24 for those that find this later on:

ATT works! Slow but usable data, and I always have signal in town. GCI internet is pricey, try finding someone to go on halves with. Bring your own router if you have any networking plans (theirs is locked down and mobile app based 🤢). If you stay in HCGH, be prepared for a struggle with internet (thick prison walls and ONE coax that needs a splitter, upstairs.) and to use the repeaters GCI gives you.

Weather wise, wind chill can be killer but if you're accustomed to ~20/30F, you'll be fine. Don't overpack on warm weather clothing if you're resistant to colder temps, especially if you're looking at May into summer.

Bars. Not my shtick, but if I had to pick then I'd stick with ANB, BoT, and the one inside of the Nome Nugget Inn.

Package delivery *sucks*. If you know you're coming up here and already have an address, order it a week before you leave. If its from FedEx, find a goat and a knife and pray.

Hello Central is a nice spot. Shared kitchen and restrooms, but this can be mitigated by getting in when there are only a few people here like now. Washer is 1.50$ and Dryer is 1$, both in quarters.

Along with being prepared for everything to cost more up here, >>**bring cash**<<. Taxis around town are $8 ($10 to/from the airport) and quite a few other places are cash only. There's a WF in town with an ATM and the stores take card, but just be prepared.

Finally, join the `Nome Post` group on FB. It's the central hub of comings and goings in a town this small. Events, sales, and general notices are actively posted on it. I don't use FB, but I made an account specifically to be on it because it is that useful.

I have a GMC cargo van which I am perfectly comfortable living out of.  I have everything I need to keep warm and I have plenty of experience maintaining engines and vehicles in sub zero temperatures.

I have plenty of experience working 12+ hours/day in sub zero temperatures.

My dream is to work on a vessel in the Bering Sea.  I don't have much experience on boats.  Just a few fishing charters in the Atlantic in not so rough waters.

How hard would it be for me to find a greenhorn job on a commercial vessel out of Homer before I start my employment on a factory vessel in Dutch?  Any tips on how to get a job quickly when I get there?  Is it better to just go straight to Dutch and look for a job there?

I will be in Homer in 1 month.

Update:
After reading all of the comments about trawling vessels and doing a little research I’ve decided that’s not something I want to be a part of.

820,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, icy, comfortable","Moving to Juneau, question about cars","Hi everyone! I know this is a typical “moving” post but I have received mixed responses from others on what to do about a car if moving to Juneau.

Not pulling the trigger on moving until I’ve got employment offers, but there is no question, I am for sure moving up there eventually because my fiancé will be going up there for work in a month. 

Right now I have a 2WD Buick encore, it’s completely paid off and has no issues. I have read that if moving up to Alaska it is probably best to sell it and get a 4WD car. However this is a tough financial decision for me to make because I just graduated PA school and am already in a lot of debt. And obviously the market for cars is rough and expensive at the moment. 

Any insights into how drivable Juneau is with a 2WD car? I’ve read the winters are much milder compared to other areas of Alaska and that the main concern is rain. Obviously I am going to prioritize safety over everything so if it’s really not safe to take my car up there I will just have to bite the bullet. 

Also putting a plug in here for jobs. I’m a physician assistant and right now I’m not seeing any openings in town but hoping maybe word of mouth will get me somewhere. Any leads for this are very appreciated!


UPDATE: I appreciate everyone’s thoughts on here it’s been helpful and informative. I came up for two weeks to get my bearings and find a job and I did just that(did not find a PA job yet but got a decent paying McJob, gotta start somewhere). My AWD rental was slipping and sliding on certain days however(no incidents or getting stuck) and the clearance was pretty high in some areas after a snow dumping, so that basically told me I need to sell my car cause I am not comfortable driving a 2WD like that. I’m also getting quite a lot more for my car than I thought due to inflated prices so yeah! The locals told me this was as bad as it’s gonna get icy conditions wise but I just want to be safe and get to work alright lol. Thanks again.",2023-01-19 05:30:47

822,Alaska,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, frosty, love",What is it like in Alaska?,"Ok this probably gets asked heaps on here but what's it like in Alaska? Also what places would you recommend a tourist checkout? And yes, I know that Alaska is huge, so I want to know what is life from people from all different parts of Alaska (The Panhandle, The Interior, North Slope, Anchorage, Aleutian Islands etc. Me and my mum want to visit Alaska and Canada one day.

I am from Australia but want to travel to Alaska one day but it is so huge (the irony is that my state is over twice the size of Alaska in terms of area) and I don't know where I'd want to visit. Australia isn't too bad, but I'm starting to get a bit sick of where I'm living at the moment. To give you an idea why, and what it is like here, I'll explain. I live in Perth, which is in the state of Western Australia.

It's sunny all year round, which makes for some excellent crisp winter days, but it is very hot. I'll use F instead of C to give you an idea of the temperature without needing to use an online converter. In February there were only like three days where the daytime temperature was below 95F. It doesn't always get a lot cooler at night, it can still be 95F at like 9pm. I have never seen snow in my life and would love to experience what a true winter is like at least once in my life. That being said, I don't know if I'm a winter person per say, since I haven't experienced a proper cold winter (winter here is like 40-70F)  but I don't exactly like 95F at 9pm either. But I would say that I prefer temperate weather, like what you'd see in the panhandle. I love rain, it only really rains a decent amount three to five months a year, and I love the stormy windy overcast weather in general it looks so cool. I love walking around in the rain, I don't even wear a raincoat either, just normal clothes.

It is becoming very expensive to live here (I'll refer to USD instead of AUD, again so that you don't have to use a converter). Food shopping costs me $65USD ($100 AUD) a week minimum and house prices are skyrocketing in Perth at the moment. That being said there are some nice suburbs, but even then for the same price I could get a much better place in Alaska or Hawaii.

The landscape is not terrible, but it's not as exciting of that of Alaska. It's mostly red sand and dry trees. The Perth Hills are also nothing compared to any mountain range in Alaska, I adore mountains despite never being to one in my life. That and I love those coniferous forests which you see in most of Alaska. The only place that looks similar in Australia is the Bunya Mountains National Park in Queensland.

The crime rate in Perth is also somewhat high, not anywhere near as high as somewhere like Chicago, Baltimore and East St Louis, but still high. It has the highest amount of homicides of any city in Australia (55 homicides last year, 68 in 2016), and some suburbs are unsafe. That being said it really varies from suburb to suburb. Most of the suburbs north of the river are very safe, I live north of the river, but they are more expensive. Whereas there are some very disadvantaged suburbs south of the river that really struggle with crime. For example, Armadale, which has traditionally been considered one of the worst areas in Perth for crime has a population of only 13415 people, but had 688 violent crimes last year and from my experience walking around there it is pretty dodgy (I always hear of many incidents on the news as well.

Also keen to visit Barrow/Utqiagvik, I find it interesting that they can get polar day and polar night. Honestly it wouldn't even bother me, I actually like reduced daylight hours in winter and increased daylight hours in summer. That and the arctic just seems kind of cool.

Kenai Fjords and Wasilla also intrigue me.

Most definitely want to visit Unalaska, honestly I can't think of a more beautiful looking place.

But what really captivates me is the Gates of the Arctic National Park. Apparently they do plane tours over it, if I visit Alaska I will 100% do the Gates of the Arctic Air Adventure from the Northern Alaska Tour Company.

How would today's modern EV's fare in North Dakota's cold winters?  What happens if one sits outside in sub zero degree temperatures for 8 hours while someone is at work or sits outside for a week?  (Not everyone has an insulated garage.)  Can you start one up at -10 degrees F without inflicting any damage on the batteries or the vehicle?  How will the cold affect the lifespan of the expensive batteries?  Will they lose their ability to provide range over time?

Not all of the vehicles will have to be electric, so maybe it would make sense for North Dakota to be an outlier with a higher proportion of gas vehicles.

**EDIT**  Thanks for everyone's responses.  For clarification I'm not anti-EV; I'd love to have one.  I'm just worried about the practical issues that could affect their longevity in this climate.

* What is the long term effect on the batteries after they've dealt with sitting out at -10 deg F year after year?  Can we expect expensive battery replacement costs after several years?

* Will we see special cold weather versions that come with battery heaters?",2023-04-15 08:21:32

832,North Dakota,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",Vehicle Advice For ND,"Our family moved to ND a few years ago and we were spoiled this winter with the weather, but with this recent change we decided to start looking in to some options for our vehicles and any advice... because we get conflicting info at times. For info we were originally from the desert in AZ and I spent a  good portion of my time driving off anything resembling a road due to the environment we lived in.

1. We have a 2019 pickup that rests nightly outside. Last year I installed a trickle charger on it for the battery, but I am still having an issue with starting it on the cold mornings (starter turns fine, but it takes multiple attempts to cold start). Is this pretty normal and fine for weather like this, or is this something that could cause damage to the engine and I need to get a block heater? *Have gotten conflicting info on that one about people having block heaters on their newer trucks, even sitting outside.

2. My wife is looking for a new vehicle and is a tad nervous driving in the winter because she went off the road last year in her AWD vehicle (From people I have talked to, this is just something that happens to a good portion of people out here) and I explain to her that it isn't too bad. I recommend to her that we replace her vehicle with something 4WD and learn to use it, but half of the people she knows swear by AWD, the other half tell her 4WD, clearance and knowing when to use the 4WD is better.. so pluses and minuses?

We love the cold so moving from 110 degrees to this has been great for us... but horrible for everything we own.",2024-01-13 07:54:05

How would today's modern EV's fare in North Dakota's cold winters?  What happens if one sits outside in sub zero degree temperatures for 8 hours while someone is at work or sits outside for a week?  (Not everyone has an insulated garage.)  Can you start one up at -10 degrees F without inflicting any damage on the batteries or the vehicle?  How will the cold affect the lifespan of the expensive batteries?  Will they lose their ability to provide range over time?

[EPA reportedly planning to announce significant limits on tailpipe emissions to boost electric vehicle adoption](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/08/epa-reportedly-planning-to-announce-significant-limits-on-tailpipe-emissions.html)

Not all of the vehicles will have to be electric, so maybe it would make sense for North Dakota to be an outlier with a higher proportion of gas vehicles.

**EDIT**  Thanks for everyone's responses.  For clarification I'm not anti-EV; I'd love to have one.  I'm just worried about the practical issues that could affect their longevity in this climate.  (I may be making a new vehicle purchase in the next few years, and EV vs. ICE could become an issue.)  Some additional questions that have occurred to me:

* What is the long term effect on the batteries after they've dealt with sitting out at -10 deg F year after year?  Can we expect expensive battery replacement costs after several years?

* Will we see special cold weather versions that come with battery heaters?",2023-04-15 08:21:32

For info we were originally from the desert in AZ and I spent a  good portion of my time driving off anything resembling a road due to the environment we lived in.

1. We have a 2019 pickup that rests nightly outside. Last year I installed a trickle charger on it for the battery, but I am still having an issue with starting it on the cold mornings (starter turns fine, but it takes multiple attempts to cold start). Is this pretty normal and fine for weather like this, or is this something that could cause damage to the engine and I need to get a block heater? *Have gotten conflicting info on that one about people having block heaters on their newer trucks, even sitting outside.

2. My wife is looking for a new vehicle and is a tad nervous driving in the winter because she went off the road last year in her AWD vehicle (From people I have talked to, this is just something that happens to a good portion of people out here) and I explain to her that it isn't too bad. I recommend to her that we replace her vehicle with something 4WD and learn to use it, but half of the people she knows swear by AWD, the other half tell her 4WD, clearance and knowing when to use the 4WD is better.. so pluses and minuses?

We love the cold so moving from 110 degrees to this has been great for us... but horrible for everything we own.",2024-01-13 07:54:05

954,North Dakota,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, love","North Dakota, extreme cold, and Electric Vehicles","I've probably asked this a couple times here and there, but with renewed talk of the federal government wanting to force electric vehicles on people, it seems relevant.  

How would today's modern EV's fare in North Dakota's cold winters?  What happens if one sits outside in sub zero degree temperatures for 8 hours while someone is at work or sits outside for a week?  (Not everyone has an insulated garage.)  Can you start one up at -10 degrees F without inflicting any damage on the batteries or the vehicle?  How will the cold affect the lifespan of the expensive batteries?  Will they lose their ability to provide range over time?

[EPA reportedly planning to announce significant limits on tailpipe emissions to boost electric vehicle adoption](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/08/epa-reportedly-planning-to-announce-significant-limits-on-tailpipe-emissions.html)

Not all of the vehicles will have to be electric, so maybe it would make sense for North Dakota to be an outlier with a higher proportion of gas vehicles.

**EDIT**  Thanks for everyone's responses.  For clarification I'm not anti-EV; I'd love to have one.  I'm just worried about the practical issues that could affect their longevity in this climate.  (I may be making a new vehicle purchase in the next few years, and EV vs. ICE could become an issue.)  Some additional questions that have occurred to me:

* What is the long term effect on the batteries after they've dealt with sitting out at -10 deg F year after year?  Can we expect expensive battery replacement costs after several years?

* Will we see special cold weather versions that come with battery heaters?",2023-04-15 08:21:32

956,North Dakota,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, love",Vehicle Advice For ND,"Our family moved to ND a few years ago and we were spoiled this winter with the weather, but with this recent change we decided to start looking in to some options for our vehicles and any advice... because we get conflicting info at times. For info we were originally from the desert in AZ and I spent a  good portion of my time driving off anything resembling a road due to the environment we lived in.

1. We have a 2019 pickup that rests nightly outside. Last year I installed a trickle charger on it for the battery, but I am still having an issue with starting it on the cold mornings (starter turns fine, but it takes multiple attempts to cold start). Is this pretty normal and fine for weather like this, or is this something that could cause damage to the engine and I need to get a block heater? *Have gotten conflicting info on that one about people having block heaters on their newer trucks, even sitting outside.

2. My wife is looking for a new vehicle and is a tad nervous driving in the winter because she went off the road last year in her AWD vehicle (From people I have talked to, this is just something that happens to a good portion of people out here) and I explain to her that it isn't too bad. I recommend to her that we replace her vehicle with something 4WD and learn to use it, but half of the people she knows swear by AWD, the other half tell her 4WD, clearance and knowing when to use the 4WD is better.. so pluses and minuses?

We love the cold so moving from 110 degrees to this has been great for us... but horrible for everything we own.",2024-01-13 07:54:05

974,North Dakota,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, comfortable","I'm eelocating to the icy north, need advice.","So details.

I'm a 31 year old male, born and raised in central Arkansas and never left much. I have a felony and I'm on disability for my autism and CPTSD, I own a 2008 Honda Shadow 750 and a 2001 Honda Accord.  Next September me and my fiancee are moving to North Dakota, likely Towner, Minot, or the surrounding area. (Fiancee and their family are from there)

I'm VERY used to Arkansan ""country"" folks, having ""nothing to do"" (ie clubs fairs arcades etc) but I'm fairly well addicted to the internet and videogames (Side money I make also involves computers, 3D printing)
I'm also used to HOT very humid (mid to high 80% on average) summers.

I guess what I'm asking out of this post is a decently detailed list of important things I should keep in mind when moving up north. Basic changes in heat/cold maintenance for the home and vehicle, basic care tips for them in cold weather,  what type of wile life to look out for, if these towns or the ones near them have decent reliable internet connections (500mbps) and more importantly what to expect as far as person-to-person interaction. For reference, when I say ""I'm autistic"" I don't mean I'm slightly on the spectrum, I mean it's the primary reason for my inability to work, so much so I literally cannot naturally read facial emotion.

How would today's modern EV's fare in North Dakota's cold winters?  What happens if one sits outside in sub zero degree temperatures for 8 hours while someone is at work or sits outside for a week?  (Not everyone has an insulated garage.)  Can you start one up at -10 degrees F without inflicting any damage on the batteries or the vehicle?  How will the cold affect the lifespan of the expensive batteries?  Will they lose their ability to provide range over time?

Not all of the vehicles will have to be electric, so maybe it would make sense for North Dakota to be an outlier with a higher proportion of gas vehicles.

**EDIT**  Thanks for everyone's responses.  For clarification I'm not anti-EV; I'd love to have one.  I'm just worried about the practical issues that could affect their longevity in this climate.  (I may be making a new vehicle purchase in the next few years, and EV vs. ICE could become an issue.)  Some additional questions that have occurred to me:

* What is the long term effect on the batteries after they've dealt with sitting out at -10 deg F year after year?  Can we expect expensive battery replacement costs after several years?

* Will we see special cold weather versions that come with battery heaters?",2023-04-15 08:21:32
977,North Dakota,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, love",Vehicle Advice For ND,"Our family moved to ND a few years ago and we were spoiled this winter with the weather, but with this recent change we decided to start looking in to some options for our vehicles and any advice... because we get conflicting info at times. For info we were originally from the desert in AZ and I spent a  good portion of my time driving off anything resembling a road due to the environment we lived in.

1. We have a 2019 pickup that rests nightly outside. Last year I installed a trickle charger on it for the battery, but I am still having an issue with starting it on the cold mornings (starter turns fine, but it takes multiple attempts to cold start). Is this pretty normal and fine for weather like this, or is this something that could cause damage to the engine and I need to get a block heater? *Have gotten conflicting info on that one about people having block heaters on their newer trucks, even sitting outside.

2. My wife is looking for a new vehicle and is a tad nervous driving in the winter because she went off the road last year in her AWD vehicle (From people I have talked to, this is just something that happens to a good portion of people out here) and I explain to her that it isn't too bad. I recommend to her that we replace her vehicle with something 4WD and learn to use it, but half of the people she knows swear by AWD, the other half tell her 4WD, clearance and knowing when to use the 4WD is better.. so pluses and minuses?

We love the cold so moving from 110 degrees to this has been great for us... but horrible for everything we own.",2024-01-13 07:54:05

My dream that I’ve been fantasizing about is moving to Minnesota if/when I get approved for SSI, 

I’ve in Florida All my life so I don’t know much about the cold and living in it, the place I’m wanting to move to is crookston, but unfortunately there’s very little info about it on the internet since it is such a small town and niche topic. It is evidently one of the coldest habitable places on the planet, , because it’s a cold area plus is very flat with very few trees to block any wind, so appearently gets down to like -60 windchill, and gets frequent blizzards, so I’ll be diving in the deep end 

I also don’t drive, and wouldn’t be able afford it even if I could, so I’ll be planning on relying only on foot, bike, and bus. I’ve been told by locals that it would be a very bad idea, and to not do it, it’d be near impossible to live there without a car. But I think with the right plan I can figure out a way to make it work.

So if anyone’s knollegable  about the what it’s like in the areas near the crookston and grand forks area and willing to help me brainstorm solutions I would appreciate the help immensely, 

my current worst case scenario plan is: “if it’s as bad in the winter as they say it is, and itd be impossible for me to get to the store for 4 month straight each winter”- then I’d stock up supplies each year during the warmer months then hybernating like a bear in my house, not leaving it for the 4 months that are too cold and windy to leave the house safely. I was also assured with about 90% certainty that Amazon does deliver to that area even during the winter, so ide be able to have access to that if I need anything during the hybernation months that I don’t have or run out of
