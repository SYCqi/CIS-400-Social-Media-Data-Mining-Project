1,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, love",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

3,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, love",Why do you stay? ,"I get this question often and I’m sure many of you do too. Hurricanes aren’t new & people have always chose to live here despite their ferociousness. Why will vary person to person so I can only answer for myself. 

I’m 7th generation and my family was here before the civil war. My roots go so deep my great grandmother was even raised in a lighthouse her sister (my great aunt) husband operated and maintained. The first of my ancestors arrived to survey the Everglades. I’ve tried to leave but I just find this place to be too magical not to return to. 

The manatees in the springs. The alligators so old and so perfect that evolution found no need to change them in 8 million years. The ocean and all its fruit. The sunny winters and thunderstorms in the summer. The cypress trees towering above the swamps and tanned rivers. The Spanish moss hanging from old oaks so gracefully it feels like a painting from one’s dreams- I just can’t imagine wanting to be anywhere else and so I stay, raising my families 8th generation of Floridan, lending a hand to my fellow Floridians as we rebuild. 

There are enough threads on why people hate Florida or anxious to tell someone why they’re leaving, so I’m curious, why do you stay? Tell me what you love so much that ties you to our beloved land? Please, save the negativity for another thread, there is enough of them. ",2024-10-01 18:10:44

6,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, love",Update: Coming for you,"Hello Florida. Its be Björn from Sweden again. I want to update you with my new plans to visit your country. I got very many tips in the open comments and also in the privates. Link to the post before below.

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19

8,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, love",I love Florida,"I love Florida so much. The beautiful land, springs, wildlife, weather (hurricanes🙂), sun..I can go on. I love it here. I don't own much so I'm not intimidated by the climate, and I was born and raised here. I just have been feeling sad by the things happening with the people.

I feel like we are not taking care of Florida. We are changing it into something unenjoyable. I feel like some people are caught up in making Florida ""theirs"", when in reality, Florida is for not just one. Florida is a piece of land that is extremely diverse in plants and animals. Florida is for observation only.

I think Florida should be protected from demolition. We should all protect Florida from the bleaching that some people are bringing. The plants and animals can't vote or talk, so we need to do it for them. Protect Florida!!!!!!!!!!!",2023-05-12 18:59:29
9,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, love","People love to hate on Florida, but is it actually that bad? ","FL can be crazy, that’s for sure. But I find it entertaining whenever I visit. I live in CT where it’s great and safe but so uneventful it gets boring/depressing, especially since it’s cold from Oct-April. So whenever I visit FL (Tampa Bay and Miami) I feel “alive”. From what I’ve seen is just a normal state where people live normal lives, nothing out of this world. I’m sure it’s different when you live there. Besides the weather, what’s so bad about it? 

Edit: to those telling me not to move to FL just for the heck of it, I will come and give you a long hug under the sun mid-August. Don’t test me. ",2024-08-02 20:43:22
10,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, love",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

13,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, love",Has anybody here actually left Florida? Where did you end up moving and did you like it?,"Not sure what other subreddit to post this one, so if you know a better subreddit, let me know.

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

But I have this fear, it always seems like everybody is talking about leaving Florida, but they never seem to actually do it.  Furthermore, people who do, it often seems like they end up back in short time.  One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.  

So what I am asking here, is there any success stories from former Floridians who moved away and loved it? Or just anybody who can share some experiences? I deeply fear falling into the ""grass is greener"" trap, but then finding out the grass is yellow everywhere.  But I do feel like in my heart of hearts deep down I should relocate before my mental sanity flies off the handle in extremely crowded and busy area I live.",2023-04-30 17:30:36

16,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, love",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

I live in central Florida, where there's obviously a lot of hot sunny days. But I also live in a neighborhood where there are a lot of trees, my property has 11 in or around it. At all times at least a 1/3 of my house is under tree shade. My house is gabled if that is relevant, but the common area is vaulted.

I am having my house reroofed in two months. When I had the guy out for a quote I asked him if he had light coloured or cool roof options. He said yes, they use Owens Corning and these have reflective granules that help though he was very insistent to let me know they are not actually energy star. He said they used to be but no longer have that, so not sure if they changed the shingles or if the requirements for getting that changed and they just lost the certificate. I digress, He insisted that the colour I chose wouldn't effect it as much as I think, especially because he noted the ventilation currently is just two vents, and they will be adding shingle over ridge vents. He also suggested dark because of the trees, insisting that the lighter colours will look gross and moldy which is definitely true as my drip edge is white now and they look terrible no matter how often I clean them.

My issue is I don't want to chose aesthetic over energy efficiency. 1/3 of the house is vaulted so there is no attic space above. And even if these Owen Corning Duration have this reflective granules and we add much more ventilation, will that be enough to keep my energy from going up? I don't think the roof guy is lying, I'm just concerned he doesn't actually know cause his job is to sell roofs, not know what happens after that.

TLDR, I have a lot of trees and live in central Florida. Roofer insisted with the Owen Corning Duration, colour doesn't matter much and he recommended black roof so it doesn't look dirty from tree debris. I'm concerned my energy bill will go up but he insists it won't cause they will be adding more ventilation. I have never seen a black roof here and I feel like there's a reason why.

  
Edit: just to clarify, the roof guy recommended the black or gray shingles, but it is ultimately my choice. he was not trying to push them onto me if it's coming across that way. I made a mockup and LOVED the black shingles.",2024-05-26 15:16:06
31,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, love",Just did a great work trip through Florida! What a cool state.,"Hello Floridians of Reddit!

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I’m 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami’s airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! 👀 wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I’ve ever been too, and I’ve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I’ve ever experienced; and I’ve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I’m going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I’m heading to Tampa which I’m very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! 😋

Anywho, just wanted to holler and tell you how cool I thought this state was, not being in the touristy Orlando spots. I hope to come down here and go camping in panther country some day. I had no idea panther crossing were a real thing before today?! I’m just blown away with how much there is to do, and eat down here–it’s endless! What a cool f’n place. It was 35* and snowing when I left Utah. Y’all have it to good!",2023-03-23 21:46:57

The COL is lower than NYC, and that was super appealing as well. 

When I visited my sister in October, I liked how it felt like vacation…but was kind of uncomfortable. The humidity was insane, my allergies were on max, and I was itchy as soon as I walked out the door. 

My sister is trying to convince me to move down to Orlando where she lives, but she makes nearly 6 figures in a remote position in a company based in NYC. I don’t make that much money. She’s trying to sell me a dream and tells me I’m “scared” and overthinking when I think I’m being cautious lol. I also have to consider expenses. 

My other options are Northern Virginia, DC, PA, NJ. 

I was looking through the sub and instead of asking about pros and cons, tell me why you’re leaving. I’d love to hear from those of you who moved from the Northeast and are leaving the state. 

Mostly so that I can give my sister actual reasons she can’t argue about because she can’t take “no” as an answer.

I know I’ll get downvoted based on “we’re full!” Lol 😂

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating. I'd be giving up everything I love, even down to the food, weather, and geography.

44,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, love",Please Help Us Understand How Communities Respond to Disasters!,"Hi Reddit! 👋 We're participating in a hackathon focused on improving community resilience during natural disasters, and we need your insights! When extreme weather events hit—floods, hurricanes, wildfires—evacuations and rescues become critical, but sometimes, resources and helping hands are limited. We're exploring ideas to strengthen our communities and would love to hear from you.

**The Concept:** Imagine a community where, in times of disaster, those with the means (vehicles, boats, safe spaces) not only ensure their own evacuation but also assist others in need. This support wouldn’t just be voluntary; there would be incentives—things like tax breaks, gift cards, or community points that could be redeemed for local benefits.

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **If you had resources to help during a disaster (like a truck, extra room, etc.), would incentives motivate you to help others evacuate?**
2. **What types of incentives do you think would encourage people in your community to step up in times of crisis?**
3. **What barriers would prevent you from helping others in a disaster situation?**
4. **What’s one thing you think your community could do better to be prepared for an emergency?**

Your feedback could help shape a new solution that empowers communities to be more resilient in the face of climate challenges. If you have personal stories, ideas, or thoughts on the incentives system, please drop a comment below!

51,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

I’m 7th generation and my family was here before the civil war. My roots go so deep my great grandmother was even raised in a lighthouse her sister (my great aunt) husband operated and maintained. The first of my ancestors arrived to survey the Everglades. I’ve tried to leave but I just find this place to be too magical not to return to. 

The manatees in the springs. The alligators so old and so perfect that evolution found no need to change them in 8 million years. The ocean and all its fruit. The sunny winters and thunderstorms in the summer. The cypress trees towering above the swamps and tanned rivers. The Spanish moss hanging from old oaks so gracefully it feels like a painting from one’s dreams- I just can’t imagine wanting to be anywhere else and so I stay, raising my families 8th generation of Floridan, lending a hand to my fellow Floridians as we rebuild.

56,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, hate",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

I've been so focused on my disgust of DeSantis and the policy makers here, the school board in Sarasota where my children go to school and so on that I've stopped taking time to appreciate some of the special things about Florida that I love.  So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

freaking love it out there",2023-07-19 15:00:23

Im finishing 3 months this year in Silicon Valley for another internship.

I have to know, what is with all the hatred on this sub? Some of the common points I see when people are hating on Fl are 1) cost of living, 2) weather, 3) insurance companies leaving.

cost of living, forget about it, insurance, forget about it, weather? how many years have these wildfires been happening?

For christs sake, you people have NO INCOME TAX!!!! Only a handful of states in the US have this privilege, and florida is the only one with good beaches. No income tax, wonderful destinations, plenty of jobs, yall have alot to be grateful for.  Id KILL for no income tax, thats literally a gift from god. Most people have to fight tooth and nail to evade taxes, but your government just hands it to you on a silver platter. Ive lived in florida, and ive lived in the sapphire blue toilet bowl on the other side of the country, trust me, Id take FL any day.

Im not trying to paint this as a left or right thing, I identify as socially left and economically right, so I am  not taking a side here. but seriously yall need to appreciate what you have that us in other states (CA, NC,SC) dont have at all.

I understand some of yall dont like desantis and dont like his social policy, fair enough (although that new alimony law should have won some of you socially left people over, alimony is a patriarchal construct in the first place)

but come on, what NON-SOCIAL (I repeat, NON-SOCIAL) policies do you have or not have in florida that you think california does better? as someone whos lived in both, Im genuinely curious

I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.

73,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06

I’m 37 and I live with my parents. I make 67,000 a year and cannot afford my own place, I SHOULD HATE transplants according to y’all’s, but guess what? I don’t. You know why? Because that’s the name of the game, that’s right.

Florida is essentially developed swampland, sure but Florida has a desirable climate, low taxes, and lots of corporations are moving here. Home prices here have gone up FASTER than the average ever since the invention of home air conditioning, florida has always had more inflow for most of y’all’s lives, for a reason.

I own a cabin in Anchorage AK, I bought it to fish, and avoid paying taxes on a work bonus. I’d kill myself if I had to live there. Believe it or not, but most people don’t like the cold. Most of the land area in the US gets pretty cold(below freezing lows for at least 1/3 of the year) and people are free to spend their money and move wherever they want.

Supply and demand forces are at play, many of us who are not homeowners may never own a home here, it sucks BIG, but that’s how it works. Same shit happened in Hawaii, bulldozed native homes to build ostentatious beachfront homes, LA, San Diego, Phoenix, Arizona, you think you’re special?. That’s just the name of game, jit. That’s how capitalism works. Prices don’t go up because it sucks living here. The brutal winters in NYC sucked asshole. The summer “nights” at the cabin suck asshole.

Every place with a appealing climate is gonna get rocked with not affordable CoL, that’s how it works, that’s how it has worked and it’s how it will always work.

Don’t have a gripe because people want to live in a nicer place, with nicer weather, with nicer tax treatment. That’s petty, makes you look childish.

If you’re dead set on hating someone because you’ll never own a home here, hate Airbnb, OpenDoor, and Zillow, don’t hate people because they see an opportunity to live a better life, fuck that.

Snowbirds though… fuck em(because they don’t contribute to society and drive like crap) but once again, what can you do, they got the money, they’re gonna do what they’re gonna do.",2023-01-15 03:22:03

Feel free to contribute below!

# Hurricanes

Hurricanes are part of living in Florida. Some years nothing happens, some years it's a wild ride.

If you're going to live beach side, then you need to take hurricanes seriously. Wind conditions leading up to them can and will cause the bridges to the mainland to close, meaning you can be cut off for extended periods from everything, including emergency services. Flooding/Storm Surge are real dangers to life and property. Make sure you have a plan way in advance for the high likelihood that you will lose both electricity and running water.

The further you get away from the coast and intracoastal zone, the lower the risks you have from severe damage from hurricanes, even major ones. But still have a plan, because anything can happen. Look for houses that have hurricane shutters or look into getting your home fit with them. Consider areas with buried power lines, as they're less likely to lose power. You can have a storm like Faye sit off the coast for days and flood almost everything. You can have tornadoes spawn from them. Fences are regular casualties of almost any named storm. Trees should be trimmed well in advance, paying close attention to when final collections occur before the storm hits so you don't have piles of potential wind debris laying in your yard.

That said: hurricanes are typically overblown by the media and should not be a major deterrent. As long as you have a plan and make sure that you're ready for the worst that could happen, you should almost always come out of the other side of hurricanes fine. Our local government knows how to handle them and a lot of infrastructure is built to withstand them. Most of us who have been through many of them don't consider anything Cat 3 or less to be anything more than a couple hour inconvenience. But always have a plan, no matter what.

# Car & Home Owners Insurance

Yes, Florida has one of the highest rates of Car & Home Owners insurance in the US. It is recommended you find an insurance broker who can shop around (at no cost to you) for the best rates for your needs. 

Car Insurance is required by law per vehicle per driver. 

# Toll Roads and You

Welcome to Florida, home of what seems like every toll road on the planet. You can certainly get around them, but it's significantly more efficient to use tolls.

E-pass Vs Sunpass: one or the other for all the tolls around Florida. Both are accepted across Florida, Georgia and North Carolina. E-PASS has less issues. Plus the advantage of their Uni, which is accepted across 18 states. Both gives you discounts on most tolls Florida.

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous. 

What happened to Florida? Its literally become the playground for the far right. I dont even associate it with Publix, alligators, oranges, beaches, dolphins and Jimmy Buffett music anymore.",2023-07-03 14:00:21

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19

88,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, enjoy",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.
 
I’m curious what you all have to say.",2024-06-12 14:37:32
89,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, enjoy",Is it really as bad as people say?,"I've been lurking on this sub quite a bit after seeing things here crossposted on other subs. I lived in the Fort Myers area for a little while and really enjoyed it before moving back to Maryland where I've lived since. Things have definitely changed a lot since the Pre-Desantis days, and especially following the devastation from Hurricane Ian, but is it really *that* bad? Is there a chance the state will become politically moderate again as it was in the past, or has the anti-LGBT lunacy really taken over the majority of the population? Just about every post/comment here is filled with negativity about the political situation, and it seems like the political shift is mostly due to the northern region (which has always been conservative), and the number of older people moving there since Covid. I've considered moving back at some point for the Tropical Weather and beaches, possibly around Broward County or elsewhere in SEFL which is fairly liberal, and I'm also wondering how things have changed there.

90,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, enjoy",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating. I'd be giving up everything I love, even down to the food, weather, and geography.

97,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, enjoy",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

Please give me some advice! I would really like to go to Florida but maybe it's better to visit some other time of year?

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

I'm looking for recommendations for family-friendly cities to visit next month. I'm in my early 20s, and my parents are in their early 60s, so we're seeking a relaxed city to visit. We're not into nightlife (lol) or water activities like swimming and snorkeling (though being on a boat is fine). Our priorities are enjoying the views, eating food, and soaking up warm weather.

Basically, I am a graduating engineer in Southern Ontario (near Toronto) and I'm unable to find a job here due to the job market.

Reasons why I want to leave Canada:

1. Terrible housing market (the low end for houses is $1M)
2. High Income Taxes
3. Terrible weather - hate the winter
4. No job opportunities

I am looking for a place where I can move with my gf (who is studying to be a dentist) to start a family. More specifically, a family friendly neighborhood.

I've visited Florida (Tampa) last August and I really loved it. Enjoyed the weather, talked to many locals who were very nice and welcoming. From my experience, Florida seems like the place to go.

I'd only be able to move there by getting a TN visa from a work sponsorship. 

My questions to you are:

1. What are the biggest cons that I might face for a person in my position?
2. What city/region would you recommend for me to move to?
3. Do you think there's another state that would better suit me?",2023-04-24 22:05:38

117,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, dislike",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

120,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, dislike",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.
 
I’m curious what you all have to say.",2024-06-12 14:37:32

144,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, happy",Happy Hurricane Season!,"Hurricane season starts June 1, and this one will be a doozy.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03
145,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US – all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07

147,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, happy",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.

150,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‘Dial *FHP for emergency’.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‘soon’.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it’s not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can’t see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‘escorting’ a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‘wide load’ sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm…) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while…. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, “Now that you’ve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?”  The response: “Sir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.” I’ll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy’s awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don’t need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‘fund raiser mode’, but the time I actually need one?

I want to do a savage coastal themed one-liner for someone in Florida, but I'm rusty at insulting people, and I don't know coastal insults. 

I would also be happy to do other local-themed insults, like ones relating them to the terrible tourists, but honestly I wouldn't know where to even start. I would really, genuinely, appreciate the help.

Also tbh Floridians kinda intimidate me. I'm fully aware that I do not have the necessary psychological toughness or heat tolerance to survive in Florida. I don't know if my insults would have sufficient kick to really hit home.

The only ones that come to mind so far, I worry they might be too mean?

""You're the type to tear a gash in your hull because you think you're too good for radar or a map.""
 
and

""You'd get caught by a riptide because you'd think everyone was just avoiding the area to give you room for a selfie.""

Most of the water-themed ones that come to my mind are stuff like ""you'd catch a Sunny and think it was a Walleye"" or lake-specific burns, but I don't really know ocean fish that well and lakes and oceans are different.

Please help. They're taking property developer money to change zoning and take down a local racetrack down in Florida, and that's frankly just gross, and I'm ticked off.

Thank you for your help. Whether or not you reply, thank you for reading and I hope you have a really wonderful day. (I actually genuinely mean it.)

169,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, comfortable",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.

I love that I live in a place where I can get on my bike and ride somewhere. But I struggle to take advantage of this in the summer. There is so much planning I need to do in order to not die from the heat. And then I can only be out for so long in the sun before I feel sick.

A lot of times I end up staying inside all day, paralyzed by trying to make the decision to go out while also trying to plan for all that would entail. A lot of the things I would prefer to do indoors tend to be out of budget for me - things like going to the movies or out to eat or shopping at the mall.

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing.

I'm from Texas and I totally get the misconceptions that certain states get but I was blown away in Florida. 

I spent a month in FTL then a week in Sarasota and night in Tallahassee. I'd love to spend more time in Tampa and Tallahassee! Tampa seems like a chiller/smaller Dallas on the ocean, with slightly more culture lol. Tallahassee is so incredibly beautiful with all the greenery and live oaks! 

There's so much to do! South Florida has so much access, to the Keys, Everglades, 2 major cruise ports, 3 large airports, amazing beaches, food, I could go on... 

Overall I was impressed with people! Everyone was so nice and chill! The drivers are insane (as they are in Dallas) but I found people were so much more genuinely nice than anticipated. (I blame Miami for the bad rap). 

All the nature and world class beaches really are just so amazing. FTL really has great access to beaches. And while I know the iguanas are invasive, I love lizards and found them fascinating. 

Side note: your summers are a notch down compared to Texas. Yes its hot. Yes it's humid. But at least yall get regular days of clouds or thunderstorms. That's exceedingly rare in Texas. you can't skimp on that sunscreen or hat though! The sun is no joke.

I've been here for 7 years and the only reason I'm leaving is the pay. I'm a scientist and state pay is like half what federal or other states pay. Decade plus of experience, $40k! Rant over.

I fell in love with it here. The palm trees, kayaking with manatees and gators, flocks of ibis, and the amazing beaches. I spent the morning with my wife at the beach, drove a while for dinner at the boathl house, and a fireworks show at Hollywood studios. I can't believe I'm leaving this paradise, even if I hate the politics and the hurricanes. 

As for things to do in Florida, I'd recommend staying for as long as you can. I'll miss you, you hot sweaty mess of a state!

Edit 1: should have been clearer since I'm getting undue sympathy. I currently make more than listed above. My contract is ending when grants expire.

The trip itinerary is 2 day in Orlando, 4 in Miami, 5 in Keywest, 2 in Fort Myers, and 6 in Sarasota area. We are doing it all by renting cars from Alamo. The trip is about 3 weeks, and I have a tight schedule.

Give me your gut reaction on what NOT to do! And of course, on what to do as well, if you like.

First, thank you all for the responses. They are so helpful.
To clarify, my family is composed of all adults over 25. We are quite a fit family and like the heat and love the ocean and beaches. August is the only month that was possible for us to get a vacation together as a whole family of 4.

**My notes:**
1. Get sunscreen. A lot of it!
2. Stay hydrated and bring plenty of water.
3. Wear UV-protective clothing.
4. Drive carefully and be nice to everyone.

195,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, love","People love to hate on Florida, but is it actually that bad? ","FL can be crazy, that’s for sure. But I find it entertaining whenever I visit. I live in CT where it’s great and safe but so uneventful it gets boring/depressing, especially since it’s cold from Oct-April. So whenever I visit FL (Tampa Bay and Miami) I feel “alive”. From what I’ve seen is just a normal state where people live normal lives, nothing out of this world. I’m sure it’s different when you live there. Besides the weather, what’s so bad about it?

196,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, love",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

But I have this fear, it always seems like everybody is talking about leaving Florida, but they never seem to actually do it.  Furthermore, people who do, it often seems like they end up back in short time.  One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.  

So what I am asking here, is there any success stories from former Floridians who moved away and loved it? Or just anybody who can share some experiences? I deeply fear falling into the ""grass is greener"" trap, but then finding out the grass is yellow everywhere.  But I do feel like in my heart of hearts deep down I should relocate before my mental sanity flies off the handle in extremely crowded and busy area I live.",2023-04-30 17:30:36

204,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, love",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

214,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

228,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, hate",Unpopular opinion: Floridian Suburbs; especially Suburbs like Cape Coral and Port St. Lucie are awful for commuting without a car.,"Some Suburbs are better than others, in the case of Suburbs in Hollywood, Florida; have jobs that are in certain instances less than a mile, 15 min walk in certain neighborhoods, decent/okay public transportation, numbers of parks; still car centric, but not terribly car centric. Suburbs that were already built before the car became the norm (1950-1960s) in the American society are better than gated communities and modern suburbs. But unfortunately, not every suburb is the same and logically, some are worse than others not just because of poverty, in particular, how people commute to work. 

This is what pisses me off about how modern suburbs are lobbied, and then build a weird nonsensical city like Cape Coral and Port St. Lucie. Before I started realizing what we were doing wrong with our infrastructure, I used to think Port St. Lucie is an amazing city, it still is. But the problem with Port St. Lucie is that there's almost not other option for commuters besides spending too much money on cars and biking in Port St. Lucie is probably a hassle than if I live in a suburb in Broward county. One, they barely have bike lanes. Two, jobs are far from where you live; it is and endless sea of homes and the jobs are more than a mile drive from the suburb. Most of the high paying jobs are concentrated in West Palm Beach. 

It is understandable why some people prefer Port St. Lucie and Cape Coral over the suburbs in South Florida. Housing is cheap (used to be before the pandemic and desanctimonious). Parking lots were available for drivers and less overcrowding. There was barely an incentive for public transit, at least when it was growing. Now, there's already too many people in the same area and there has to be a lot of changes with its infrastructure. 

Also, and despite how pricy Brightline is, I hate how they not planned a station there. 

As for Cape Coral, it's more of an environmental wasteland than Port St. Lucie and I mean it. Almost no trees, hot/humid af, unattractive for cyclists, bad public transportation, its downtown really need changes. Of course, these changes won't happen overnight and it's likely they will be stifled by the suburbanite nimby crowd if it were to happen; except if there were a tollway or an interstate.",2023-05-23 13:52:17
229,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, hate",What's something you absolutely love about Florida and its craziness?,"Been feeling pretty patriotic for the first time in forever with these Michigan electorial fraudsters getting charged and trump getting his 3rd indictment letter.  Nice to see some justice in our country again and helping me look at the better side of things.  I've been so focused on my disgust of DeSantis and the policy makers here, the school board in Sarasota where my children go to school and so on that I've stopped taking time to appreciate some of the special things about Florida that I love.  So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

250,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06

Born here, bought a house here, sold a house here, moved to NYC, moved back and now I can’t afford a comparable house because mine went up 175% since I sold it in 2019.

I’m 37 and I live with my parents. I make 67,000 a year and cannot afford my own place, I SHOULD HATE transplants according to y’all’s, but guess what? I don’t. You know why? Because that’s the name of the game, that’s right.

Florida is essentially developed swampland, sure but Florida has a desirable climate, low taxes, and lots of corporations are moving here. Home prices here have gone up FASTER than the average ever since the invention of home air conditioning, florida has always had more inflow for most of y’all’s lives, for a reason.

I own a cabin in Anchorage AK, I bought it to fish, and avoid paying taxes on a work bonus. I’d kill myself if I had to live there. Believe it or not, but most people don’t like the cold. Most of the land area in the US gets pretty cold(below freezing lows for at least 1/3 of the year) and people are free to spend their money and move wherever they want.

Supply and demand forces are at play, many of us who are not homeowners may never own a home here, it sucks BIG, but that’s how it works. Same shit happened in Hawaii, bulldozed native homes to build ostentatious beachfront homes, LA, San Diego, Phoenix, Arizona, you think you’re special?. That’s just the name of game, jit. That’s how capitalism works. Prices don’t go up because it sucks living here. The brutal winters in NYC sucked asshole. The summer “nights” at the cabin suck asshole.

Every place with a appealing climate is gonna get rocked with not affordable CoL, that’s how it works, that’s how it has worked and it’s how it will always work.

Don’t have a gripe because people want to live in a nicer place, with nicer weather, with nicer tax treatment. That’s petty, makes you look childish.

If you’re dead set on hating someone because you’ll never own a home here, hate Airbnb, OpenDoor, and Zillow, don’t hate people because they see an opportunity to live a better life, fuck that.

Snowbirds though… fuck em(because they don’t contribute to society and drive like crap) but once again, what can you do, they got the money, they’re gonna do what they’re gonna do.",2023-01-15 03:22:03

I love that I live in a place where I can get on my bike and ride somewhere. But I struggle to take advantage of this in the summer. There is so much planning I need to do in order to not die from the heat. And then I can only be out for so long in the sun before I feel sick.

A lot of times I end up staying inside all day, paralyzed by trying to make the decision to go out while also trying to plan for all that would entail. A lot of the things I would prefer to do indoors tend to be out of budget for me - things like going to the movies or out to eat or shopping at the mall.

266,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, enjoy",What has happened to Florida?,"I grew up in FL and moved away when I was 20. While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous.

272,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, enjoy",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean.

Also my wife and I both enjoy outdoors more, loves gardening. I really hate the cold weather and trying to see if I should move to southern state. my son is junior this year so my goal is to move after his highschool, just to avoid any disturbance during his school.

I am considering the south of Georgia or north of Florida like Jacksonville, Gainesville, Ocala and may be Orlando too. We are not big fan of beach so definitely not considering any coastal areas.

We are in early 40s and considering buying a land (may be 2-4 ac lot) and get it constructed and use most of the portion in gardening and growing our own food.

Generally 2ac or more lots are available in outskirts of these cities. we like more of the rural communities and we might be Ok with this. Do we need to worry about security concerns in outskirts?

285,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, enjoy","I-4, I-10, I-75, and I-95. How would you rank them and which one to you is the least headache inducing?","I've not really been on Interstate 10, because I've truthfully never ventured into the panhandle

 I-4 is always a disaster whenever I get onto it, pretty much anything from Tampa all the way to Sanford sucks in the worst ways possible. Anything can go wrong on any second of that highway, so you have to take extreme precautions and measures when getting on to the interstate, and deciding when the best time it is to merge, speed, slow down, and especially watching for where to get off at. It's like a game of cards except that the odds are completely stacked against you. If you mess up and make a wrong turn off a wrong exit, it might set you back another 20-30 minutes. If someone crashes, the whole road will get shut down. There aren't that many places to stop off at. Getting off is hardly an option. But I think the worst thing about I-4 is that there are no alternative routes to it. If you're driving from Orlando over to Tampa or Lakeland, it's I-4 or nothing, and you can't really avoid it, which doesn't help the horrible traffic situation. It's the busiest corridor in all of Florida. It also doesn't help that most of the road is urbanized as between Tampa and Orlando, you also have Polk County which consists of Lakeland and Winter Haven. And then north of that you have Disney and all the theme parks and international traveling that makes going all the way to Orlando absolute hell. You get to see the melting pot of all the worst drivers in Florida and across the entire country. All of that contributes to definitely making I-4 one of the least fun driving experiences in the entire country in my opinion.

I live on the east coast but much like I-4, I-95 is also practically urbanized almost all the way down. You got Jacksonville, Daytona Beach, Melbourne, Port St Lucie, West Palm, Boca, Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood, and Miami. Driving 95 up and down, there's really only a few stretches of it where there's pockets of it that's rural and underdeveloped like south of Daytona to Titusville, or having less less traffic density like around the Vero Sebastian area.

I-75 is weird, because aside from Tampa there aren't that many large cities like 95 has. You start in the Miami area, and of course you have Naples, Fort Myers, and Sarasota which are major hot spots and fast growing areas. You got 275 in the Tampa Bay area, which connects St Petersburg and the rest of Pinellas and into downtown Tampa. But north of that, it's mostly nothing all the way to Georgia, with really only Ocala, Gainesville and The Villages being alongside it.


I personally don't really enjoy driving any of the main interstates in Florida, and often try my best to avoid them when I can, but oftentimes we don't have a choice, but I would still take 75 and 95 over having to ride I-4 everyday.

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating. I'd be giving up everything I love, even down to the food, weather, and geography.

290,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, enjoy",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

I was shivering. I ran into a hot shower the second I got home (okay, I fed Chewie first).  I was miserable in slightly cold weather.

317,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, dislike",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

324,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, dislike",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

I didn’t pay too much attention to the actual temperature when I was there but after researching, every source says the average temperature in Florida is around 82-86 degrees Fahrenheit.

326,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, dislike","Good stuff VS over hyped ""meh""-Share yours (non-Disney please)","I've noticed that there are soooo many over hyped places in FL versus solid choices.

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

We were at dinner the other night outside and we obviously knew it would be hot, expected to sweat,  but there was the breeze and shade etc. So anyway we are eating and sweating, but we looked around together and could not find anyone that looked as uncomfortable and sweaty as we did.

Is there some sort of secret Floridian way to not appear drenched in sweat like we did? After how many years of living here do you not sweat so much? We saw people wearing jeans and other less friendly hot weather clothing but we couldn’t find the sweat.

To make it clear, we are not complaining about the heat or the sweat or Florida. ",2024-06-06 20:49:40

354,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, annoying","Ok, I was too hard on y’all. Many Transplants make my blood boil.","I made a post here about a week ago that the hate on transplants was uncalled for and childish. I argued that people are gonna do what they’re gonna do and act in their self interests. My mindset has changed to where us wanting them the fuck out is a take that’s just fine, as we are also allowed to act in our self interests.

I read all your comments and now I pretty much fully agree with the sentiment here. I officially moved back on the 21st of December so; hell I’m still adjusting. However I lived here for the preceding 33 years of my life(currently 37). The only shock is how the people changed.

But today I was walking around the Tampa burbs at the store and someone legit said “wow it’s hot outside compared to New Jersey” and I’m like “my brother in Christ, you will not survive”. Bunch of transplants and to-be transplants here on Reddit don’t take the advice that this is a horrible state to raise a kid. This is not the best place to be in general regarding workers rights and wages, they don’t take the well informed advice that you shouldn’t move here unless you have an actual good job lined up. they don’t even acknowledge it. They are either willfully ignorant or just ignorant.

I’ve been here long enough now to see that we are freaking full.

I saw a post asking what’s a place in FL that’s like NYC and I guess that crap really grinded my gears enough to follow up on my hot take.

The complete disregard that Florida has its own set of values and subculture of the greater US annoys me, greatly. Many, NOT all, but now a measurable number legitimately believe that Florida should conform to where THEY came from.

Very annoying and fuck that. Very sad to see what happened to our state. I made a crummy argument in my last post that was not based on enough empirical evidence from the general  public.",2023-01-23 02:40:15

357,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, annoying",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

I didn’t pay too much attention to the actual temperature when I was there but after researching, every source says the average temperature in Florida is around 82-86 degrees Fahrenheit.

359,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, annoying","Good stuff VS over hyped ""meh""-Share yours (non-Disney please)","I've noticed that there are soooo many over hyped places in FL versus solid choices.

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

361,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, annoying",An Open Letter to Spring Breakers. Come to Iceland. It's Wilder.,"# An Open Letter to Every Drunk Spring Breaker in Miami

By an Iceland-ish Friend

Dear Drunk College Students,

Going to Florida for one wild and crazy week a year makes sense. It is a very pretty place, with its palm trees and beaches and elderly population. You can eat breakfast at any time of the day and sometimes alligators cross the road. 

Do you know what crosses the road in Iceland my dear drunk friends? WILD HORSES and RAINBOWS. I don’t want to be a soggy beach blanket but perhaps it’s time to consider a more exotic destination for Spring Break, somewhere you can really go wild. Iceland baby!

You want to drink until you blackout and wake up with a strange sexy person in a mysterious and sexy place? We do that all the time but we drink Brennivin while lounging nuuude in geothermal jacuzzis and later, after we make love to an attractive person who we have verified we are not related to, we sometimes wake up under the Northern Lights. Vape that, Miami. 

One time, my cousin got me so drunk I browned out, I think that’s what you call it, and I came to on top of an active volcano. And let me tell you, there’s no cure for a hangover like running for your life from red hot lava, if you get my flow, my lava flow?

Doesn’t our country sound like an enchanting place? We don’t even need drugs here because we believe in fairies and frost giants and are home to dozens of rainbows each day. But wait, there’s more! We have ice diamond beaches, geysers, glaciers, the majestic Vestrahorn Mountains, puffin colonies, waterfalls, fermented shark, more waterfalls, Björk, and Black Death drink.

Ok ok, so your friends will all be in Flooorida or something. But according to my readings, Florida is sinking! Dearest drunks, it’s sliding into the ocean. What will happen to you if you’re dancing nudey groovy and suddenly dolphins swim by? Americans are very special but I’m pretty sure you don’t have gills. This is not the Little Mermaid. Stingrays and dolphins will be happy partying in your abandoned underwater South Beach dance clubs while you search for a new submarine condo.

I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to be negative. I take that back. Let’s start over ok? No more end of times talk. 

Don’t you spend enough time with your Spring Break friends already? Aren’t you a teensy weensy bit curious to explore our fascinating Icelandic gene pool? Everyone here is good looking, friendly, and extremely strong. It’s really great! 

If we were a little genetically more diverse I wouldn’t even be writing you this letter. See dear drunks, we have a little problem. Well it’s not a problem so much as it is an annoyance. We are a small country right? Very charming, no? Well, when you’re small, you have a lot more cousins than you think - almost all of us are at least a little bit related. Some smartypants even built an app to help us avoid smooches in the family tree, thanks be to Freyja.

But what would be really super cool would be if you would bring like, a whole lot of sexy American people to Iceland for Spring Break. Maybe you’ll like it and want to stay or we can all fall in love or you know, something. 

So please forget about Miami and Cancun and that beach in Texas and come Spring Break in Iceland. 

P.S. Don’t forget your sunscreen, rain poncho, wool socks, and party pants! See you soon!

My question is: Are there any good, safe, family oriented communities around the Tampa, Sarasota, Orlando-ish areas. Less populated would be preferable. If the area is also quite walkable that would be a plus. Though my number one priority is safety and low crime.

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks!

381,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, happy",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03
388,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US – all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07

390,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, happy",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

391,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, happy",How hot does it actually get in Florida?,"In the process of moving to Florida (again), spent some time down there, a few months, the weather seemed nice anyone I ever tell about Florida the first thing they say is it’s ridiculously hot. I didn’t pay too much attention to the actual temperature when I was there but after researching, every source says the average temperature in Florida is around 82-86 degrees Fahrenheit. Is this a joke? Or are the complaints more so the heat being year around and not seasonal? 

In North Carolina our entire spring/summer has been consistently around 95 degrees with some days reaching 101 easily, it’s nearly 80 degrees at night lol yet I’ve seen nothing but Florida tags here as if everyone from Florida is moving here or the fact that Florida seems to be less hot than it is here, I don’t get it.

392,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, happy","Good stuff VS over hyped ""meh""-Share yours (non-Disney please)","I've noticed that there are soooo many over hyped places in FL versus solid choices.

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

394,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‘Dial *FHP for emergency’.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‘soon’.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it’s not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can’t see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‘escorting’ a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‘wide load’ sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm…) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while…. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, “Now that you’ve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?”  The response: “Sir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.” I’ll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy’s awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don’t need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‘fund raiser mode’, but the time I actually need one?

BTW- the inside of a lighting bolt is bright yellow.",2023-08-06 19:47:46

I talked to my GF and we want to change some plans. For all who don't know we want to go in September which is not the best time, but we don't have an other choice.

So:

9/11 arriving at Orlando and staying in a Hotel near the airport

9/12-9/15 going to Miami. Don't really have plans yet but want to do a boats tour and maybe visit Bills @ Dolphins (depending on the ticket prices), maybe also going to the beach if there is no hurricane lol

9/15-9/18 we heading to Marathon. We decided to stay in the middle of the Key's just to be flexible. I definitely want to go snorkeling and someone suggested a boat trip with glass underneath, so that sounds promessing. 

9/18-9/19 that's the part were i'm currently not happy with. My Girlfriend wants to stay in Homestead for the Everglades. I'm fine with doing an air boat tour but she also want to do a little hike. Already told her it's hot and humid but she probably needs to hear that from Florida natives. Arccording to google it's a 90 min drive so we could start the ""hike"" early but not sure about that.

9/19-9/22 staying in Sarasota. Maybe also snorkeling and going to the beach

9/22-9/24 not sure about that. Would go to Tampa for a Bucs game. I googled for sightseeing in tampa and there are tours to watch dolphins that would be nice, but not sure if I can do that also on the other locations like Marathon?

9/24-9/26 Going back to Orlando. My Girlfriend may want to go to Disney World but that will be a day trip.

9/26 flight back to germany

  
Yesterday was naples in there, but a lot of you guys said we should skip that so that's the updated plan. Idk if it's still too much because i've been to many NFL games and I know thats a day trip, same goes for Disney World.

What I expect from Florida/want to see

Well i know it's not the best time of the year to travel to Florida so we may have to adjust but that can happen everywhere in the world.

I want to see the aligators, the palm trees, turtles, dolphins, do some snorkeling, swimming, 

I can still cancel the hotels and adjust the plan if needed to. Not sure about the plans in Homestead and Tampa.",2024-07-16 05:54:38
398,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, happy",An Open Letter to Spring Breakers. Come to Iceland. It's Wilder.,"# An Open Letter to Every Drunk Spring Breaker in Miami

By an Iceland-ish Friend

Dear Drunk College Students,

Going to Florida for one wild and crazy week a year makes sense. It is a very pretty place, with its palm trees and beaches and elderly population. You can eat breakfast at any time of the day and sometimes alligators cross the road. 

Do you know what crosses the road in Iceland my dear drunk friends? WILD HORSES and RAINBOWS. I don’t want to be a soggy beach blanket but perhaps it’s time to consider a more exotic destination for Spring Break, somewhere you can really go wild. Iceland baby!

You want to drink until you blackout and wake up with a strange sexy person in a mysterious and sexy place? We do that all the time but we drink Brennivin while lounging nuuude in geothermal jacuzzis and later, after we make love to an attractive person who we have verified we are not related to, we sometimes wake up under the Northern Lights. Vape that, Miami. 

One time, my cousin got me so drunk I browned out, I think that’s what you call it, and I came to on top of an active volcano. And let me tell you, there’s no cure for a hangover like running for your life from red hot lava, if you get my flow, my lava flow?

Doesn’t our country sound like an enchanting place? We don’t even need drugs here because we believe in fairies and frost giants and are home to dozens of rainbows each day. But wait, there’s more! We have ice diamond beaches, geysers, glaciers, the majestic Vestrahorn Mountains, puffin colonies, waterfalls, fermented shark, more waterfalls, Björk, and Black Death drink.

Ok ok, so your friends will all be in Flooorida or something. But according to my readings, Florida is sinking! Dearest drunks, it’s sliding into the ocean. What will happen to you if you’re dancing nudey groovy and suddenly dolphins swim by? Americans are very special but I’m pretty sure you don’t have gills. This is not the Little Mermaid. Stingrays and dolphins will be happy partying in your abandoned underwater South Beach dance clubs while you search for a new submarine condo.

I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to be negative. I take that back. Let’s start over ok? No more end of times talk. 

Don’t you spend enough time with your Spring Break friends already? Aren’t you a teensy weensy bit curious to explore our fascinating Icelandic gene pool? Everyone here is good looking, friendly, and extremely strong. It’s really great! 

If we were a little genetically more diverse I wouldn’t even be writing you this letter. See dear drunks, we have a little problem. Well it’s not a problem so much as it is an annoyance. We are a small country right? Very charming, no? Well, when you’re small, you have a lot more cousins than you think - almost all of us are at least a little bit related. Some smartypants even built an app to help us avoid smooches in the family tree, thanks be to Freyja.

But what would be really super cool would be if you would bring like, a whole lot of sexy American people to Iceland for Spring Break. Maybe you’ll like it and want to stay or we can all fall in love or you know, something. 

So please forget about Miami and Cancun and that beach in Texas and come Spring Break in Iceland. 

P.S. Don’t forget your sunscreen, rain poncho, wool socks, and party pants! See you soon!

In the next 4 years my family and I are interested in moving to Florida for our daughter's college interests.

And I have been in my fair share of hurricanes so with any luck it'll be fine.

My question is: Are there any good, safe, family oriented communities around the Tampa, Sarasota, Orlando-ish areas. Less populated would be preferable. If the area is also quite walkable that would be a plus. Though my number one priority is safety and low crime.

I read all your comments and now I pretty much fully agree with the sentiment here. I officially moved back on the 21st of December so; hell I’m still adjusting. However I lived here for the preceding 33 years of my life(currently 37). The only shock is how the people changed.

427,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, annoyed",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

431,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, annoyed",An Open Letter to Spring Breakers. Come to Iceland. It's Wilder.,"# An Open Letter to Every Drunk Spring Breaker in Miami

By an Iceland-ish Friend

Dear Drunk College Students,

Going to Florida for one wild and crazy week a year makes sense. It is a very pretty place, with its palm trees and beaches and elderly population. You can eat breakfast at any time of the day and sometimes alligators cross the road. 

Do you know what crosses the road in Iceland my dear drunk friends? WILD HORSES and RAINBOWS. I don’t want to be a soggy beach blanket but perhaps it’s time to consider a more exotic destination for Spring Break, somewhere you can really go wild. Iceland baby!

You want to drink until you blackout and wake up with a strange sexy person in a mysterious and sexy place? We do that all the time but we drink Brennivin while lounging nuuude in geothermal jacuzzis and later, after we make love to an attractive person who we have verified we are not related to, we sometimes wake up under the Northern Lights. Vape that, Miami. 

One time, my cousin got me so drunk I browned out, I think that’s what you call it, and I came to on top of an active volcano. And let me tell you, there’s no cure for a hangover like running for your life from red hot lava, if you get my flow, my lava flow?

Doesn’t our country sound like an enchanting place? We don’t even need drugs here because we believe in fairies and frost giants and are home to dozens of rainbows each day. But wait, there’s more! We have ice diamond beaches, geysers, glaciers, the majestic Vestrahorn Mountains, puffin colonies, waterfalls, fermented shark, more waterfalls, Björk, and Black Death drink.

Ok ok, so your friends will all be in Flooorida or something. But according to my readings, Florida is sinking! Dearest drunks, it’s sliding into the ocean. What will happen to you if you’re dancing nudey groovy and suddenly dolphins swim by? Americans are very special but I’m pretty sure you don’t have gills. This is not the Little Mermaid. Stingrays and dolphins will be happy partying in your abandoned underwater South Beach dance clubs while you search for a new submarine condo.

I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to be negative. I take that back. Let’s start over ok? No more end of times talk. 

Don’t you spend enough time with your Spring Break friends already? Aren’t you a teensy weensy bit curious to explore our fascinating Icelandic gene pool? Everyone here is good looking, friendly, and extremely strong. It’s really great! 

If we were a little genetically more diverse I wouldn’t even be writing you this letter. See dear drunks, we have a little problem. Well it’s not a problem so much as it is an annoyance. We are a small country right? Very charming, no? Well, when you’re small, you have a lot more cousins than you think - almost all of us are at least a little bit related. Some smartypants even built an app to help us avoid smooches in the family tree, thanks be to Freyja.

But what would be really super cool would be if you would bring like, a whole lot of sexy American people to Iceland for Spring Break. Maybe you’ll like it and want to stay or we can all fall in love or you know, something. 

So please forget about Miami and Cancun and that beach in Texas and come Spring Break in Iceland. 

P.S. Don’t forget your sunscreen, rain poncho, wool socks, and party pants! See you soon!

In the next 4 years my family and I are interested in moving to Florida for our daughter's college interests. The idea is a little worrisome due to quite a big change in weather and temperatures from Maryland to Florida. But we are an ex-military family and have lived in some hot places in the past. And I have been in my fair share of hurricanes so with any luck it'll be fine.

My question is: Are there any good, safe, family oriented communities around the Tampa, Sarasota, Orlando-ish areas. Less populated would be preferable. If the area is also quite walkable that would be a plus. Though my number one priority is safety and low crime.

I'm still ServSafe Food Handler and manager certified. 

I'm desperate for a new job as I'm moving to another area and applied to line/prep Cook position nearby. Waffle House told me they need people who they can LITERALLY hire without showing them how to make the food, similar thing said by IHOP and Steak n Shake. This made me more desperate so I decided to apply for server positions as well, which I'm not comfortable with. Yesterday I had an interview with Applebee's and they told me they want a server they don't want to train. And they had the audacity to ask why I left McDonald's for a better job offer after working there for only 13 months, which happened years ago. Is that not self explanatory?

What. The. Fuck? I'm not saying these jobs are easy but I find it hard it's hard to train. Plus ""training""  in this line of work mostly consists of watching videos on some company portal website. How much experience do you need to work a flat top at waffle house?

454,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, comfortable",Heat film - effective heat reduction on old windows,"For those of us where replacing windows simply isn’t an option financially, or logistically, or because you’re a renter, just wanted to share a small success story on heat film.

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60’s?) single pane windows. I’m still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7° temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, “ewww. 80s? You lizard. 🦎“ ... Lol, the room is around 78° and is a completely uninsulated 1970’s porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I’m thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

458,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, comfortable",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

1. The stairs leading up to the second floor rooms are shaky and you have to use the handrails to not fall.  However, the handrails have broken and chipped paint that hurt your hands and are rusting.  Even the property manager told us she doesn't like going up and down those stairs.

2.  The drain in the hot tub looks like it spent the last 20 years under water on a ship wreck.  It was so rusted, we did not feel comfortable using it.

3.  The swimming pool and the heated mineral pool were filthy.  We actually used the skimmer to try to clean the mineral pool ourselves, but once we got in, we saw all the scum on the tiles and quickly got out.

4.  The towels were stained and had large rips.

5.  The wifi and TV service never worked the entire time we were there.

6.  Our plans changed and we needed to leave a day early.  I talked to the property manager and she said she would change the reservation and refund us what we had paid for the last night of the stay that we wouldn't be using.  We left by 10am that morning so they had plenty of time to clean the room and prepare it for someone else.  It turned out that she lied and never gave us the refund.  When we complained afterwards through Expedia's customer service, they tried contacting the property but could not get approval for the refund so we ended up paying over $300 for a night in a room we didn't use even after being assured that wouldn't happen.

7.  The nice and quiet atmosphere is now ruined by a bar that is directly adjacent to the property.  Our room was on the opposite side of the property but we still could hear the customers and the music through the walls until after 2am each night.

8.  One of the ""features"" they mention is that you are within view of the historical Flagler Beach pier.  They don't mention it was badly damaged in a storm over 2 years ago and has not been repaired and is just boarded up.  The last section of it looks like it will fall into the ocean anytime now.

9.  One of the two mornings we were there, we came down for breakfast and were told that the cook just didn't show up that day so our bed and breakfast had no breakfast but no compensation was offered for this.10.  The waitress was telling us private stuff about other staff members like a cracked skull during a fight with her boyfriend.  That isn't the story you want to hear on your romantic anniversary trip and should have been told to the police instead or out of town customers.

Overall, this place is poorly managed, not maintained and way overpriced for what you are getting.  I highly recommend avoiding it and if you have reservations already, cancel them and then monitor your credit card to make sure they don't charge you anyway.",2024-04-12 13:42:02

472,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, comfortable",Suggestions For Safe Communities Around Tampa,"Good Morning,

In the next 4 years my family and I are interested in moving to Florida for our daughter's college interests. The idea is a little worrisome due to quite a big change in weather and temperatures from Maryland to Florida. But we are an ex-military family and have lived in some hot places in the past. And I have been in my fair share of hurricanes so with any luck it'll be fine.

My question is: Are there any good, safe, family oriented communities around the Tampa, Sarasota, Orlando-ish areas. Less populated would be preferable. If the area is also quite walkable that would be a plus. Though my number one priority is safety and low crime.

Thank you in advance for any and all information.",2023-03-02 13:53:32

476,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, love",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

I’m 7th generation and my family was here before the civil war. My roots go so deep my great grandmother was even raised in a lighthouse her sister (my great aunt) husband operated and maintained. The first of my ancestors arrived to survey the Everglades. I’ve tried to leave but I just find this place to be too magical not to return to. 

The manatees in the springs. The alligators so old and so perfect that evolution found no need to change them in 8 million years. The ocean and all its fruit. The sunny winters and thunderstorms in the summer. The cypress trees towering above the swamps and tanned rivers. The Spanish moss hanging from old oaks so gracefully it feels like a painting from one’s dreams- I just can’t imagine wanting to be anywhere else and so I stay, raising my families 8th generation of Floridan, lending a hand to my fellow Floridians as we rebuild.

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table.

I spent a month in FTL then a week in Sarasota and night in Tallahassee. I'd love to spend more time in Tampa and Tallahassee! Tampa seems like a chiller/smaller Dallas on the ocean, with slightly more culture lol. Tallahassee is so incredibly beautiful with all the greenery and live oaks! 

There's so much to do! South Florida has so much access, to the Keys, Everglades, 2 major cruise ports, 3 large airports, amazing beaches, food, I could go on... 

Overall I was impressed with people! Everyone was so nice and chill! The drivers are insane (as they are in Dallas) but I found people were so much more genuinely nice than anticipated. (I blame Miami for the bad rap). 

All the nature and world class beaches really are just so amazing. FTL really has great access to beaches. And while I know the iguanas are invasive, I love lizards and found them fascinating. 

Side note: your summers are a notch down compared to Texas. Yes its hot. Yes it's humid. But at least yall get regular days of clouds or thunderstorms. That's exceedingly rare in Texas. you can't skimp on that sunscreen or hat though! The sun is no joke.

504,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, love",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

For example: we don’t do tips here but in the US it’s apparently kinda mandatory so we calculated 20% extra for all our sitdown meals, housekeeping, roomservice etc. Are there other customs we should be aware of or any social constructs we need to know so we can be respectful tourists and not be european a’holes? Also does any of you have a nice tip for a local place i definitely should visit as a newbie in your country? I’d love to also see a bit of the area outside of the parks and watch part of the local culture. Every tip/advice is welcome and appreciated! I’m really excited and look forward to a hopefully amazing trip oversees",2024-03-08 14:42:11
509,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, love",Husband is finally on board with moving out of state; need help narrowing choices,"I spent my childhood in Western NY and moved to Tampa with my parents as a teen. My husband was born and raised here. After lots of vacations to cooler temps and having more outdoorsy things to enjoy, he’s finally on board with moving out of Florida (I’ve been trying to get him to consider this for 20+ years now). We have at least 3 years to explore and plan before we’re able to move due to family and I’d love to hear your thoughts on various parts of the country that might fit what we’re looking for.

We have a list of places we AREN’T interested in: nothing in the southeast, southwest, or completely land locked states. For various reasons, it’s also a no to CA, OH, PA, KY, MO, IN, and WV.

Between us we like the PNW, New England, and northern VA/DC area. We’re not super active but we love just being outside (SE Alaska in the summer is perfect). Hiking, kayaking and canoeing, and fishing opportunities would be nice. Our kids are grown so we don’t need to worry about school systems and public transportation is not an issue for us either.  Noticeable seasonal changes and close (an hour’s drive or less) to a city at least the size of tampa are important factors. We also don’t want to feel land locked (an hour or less from a large body of water - lakes, oceans, bays, etc - is preferred).

I realize I may be searching for a unicorn. We are willing to compromise a bit.",2023-07-29 03:43:33

513,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, love",Has anybody here actually left Florida? Where did you end up moving and did you like it?,"Not sure what other subreddit to post this one, so if you know a better subreddit, let me know.

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

But I have this fear, it always seems like everybody is talking about leaving Florida, but they never seem to actually do it.  Furthermore, people who do, it often seems like they end up back in short time.  One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.  

So what I am asking here, is there any success stories from former Floridians who moved away and loved it? Or just anybody who can share some experiences? I deeply fear falling into the ""grass is greener"" trap, but then finding out the grass is yellow everywhere.  But I do feel like in my heart of hearts deep down I should relocate before my mental sanity flies off the handle in extremely crowded and busy area I live.",2023-04-30 17:30:36

Most people have to fight tooth and nail to evade taxes, but your government just hands it to you on a silver platter. Ive lived in florida, and ive lived in the sapphire blue toilet bowl on the other side of the country, trust me, Id take FL any day.

Im not trying to paint this as a left or right thing, I identify as socially left and economically right, so I am  not taking a side here. but seriously yall need to appreciate what you have that us in other states (CA, NC,SC) dont have at all.

I understand some of yall dont like desantis and dont like his social policy, fair enough (although that new alimony law should have won some of you socially left people over, alimony is a patriarchal construct in the first place)

520,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06

Born here, bought a house here, sold a house here, moved to NYC, moved back and now I can’t afford a comparable house because mine went up 175% since I sold it in 2019.

I’m 37 and I live with my parents. I make 67,000 a year and cannot afford my own place, I SHOULD HATE transplants according to y’all’s, but guess what? I don’t. You know why? Because that’s the name of the game, that’s right.

Florida is essentially developed swampland, sure but Florida has a desirable climate, low taxes, and lots of corporations are moving here. Home prices here have gone up FASTER than the average ever since the invention of home air conditioning, florida has always had more inflow for most of y’all’s lives, for a reason.

I own a cabin in Anchorage AK, I bought it to fish, and avoid paying taxes on a work bonus. I’d kill myself if I had to live there. Believe it or not, but most people don’t like the cold. Most of the land area in the US gets pretty cold(below freezing lows for at least 1/3 of the year) and people are free to spend their money and move wherever they want.

Supply and demand forces are at play, many of us who are not homeowners may never own a home here, it sucks BIG, but that’s how it works. Same shit happened in Hawaii, bulldozed native homes to build ostentatious beachfront homes, LA, San Diego, Phoenix, Arizona, you think you’re special?. That’s just the name of game, jit. That’s how capitalism works. Prices don’t go up because it sucks living here. The brutal winters in NYC sucked asshole. The summer “nights” at the cabin suck asshole.

Every place with a appealing climate is gonna get rocked with not affordable CoL, that’s how it works, that’s how it has worked and it’s how it will always work.

Don’t have a gripe because people want to live in a nicer place, with nicer weather, with nicer tax treatment. That’s petty, makes you look childish.

If you’re dead set on hating someone because you’ll never own a home here, hate Airbnb, OpenDoor, and Zillow, don’t hate people because they see an opportunity to live a better life, fuck that.

Snowbirds though… fuck em(because they don’t contribute to society and drive like crap) but once again, what can you do, they got the money, they’re gonna do what they’re gonna do.",2023-01-15 03:22:03

The first of my ancestors arrived to survey the Everglades. I’ve tried to leave but I just find this place to be too magical not to return to. 

The manatees in the springs. The alligators so old and so perfect that evolution found no need to change them in 8 million years. The ocean and all its fruit. The sunny winters and thunderstorms in the summer. The cypress trees towering above the swamps and tanned rivers.

538,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, hate",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

545,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, hate",What's something you absolutely love about Florida and its craziness?,"Been feeling pretty patriotic for the first time in forever with these Michigan electorial fraudsters getting charged and trump getting his 3rd indictment letter.  Nice to see some justice in our country again and helping me look at the better side of things.  I've been so focused on my disgust of DeSantis and the policy makers here, the school board in Sarasota where my children go to school and so on that I've stopped taking time to appreciate some of the special things about Florida that I love.  So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

freaking love it out there",2023-07-19 15:00:23

Hello! I thought it would be fun to ask this on all the state subreddits for the next 50 days.",2023-05-24 11:22:40
547,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, hate",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

Should I be concerned about Hurricane Milton? I read that it is normal to prepare bottled water, canned food, flashlight and batteries, first aid kit etc. in case of a hurricane. Should I just watch it for the next 2 or so days or just prepare early? I don't know what I should be doing right now.

Not just that it's cool, but I live for being able to leave my windows open.  Even when it's cold I have them cracked.  But then the temps begin to edge up and suddenly highs are in the upper 80s.  Then it's time to batten down the hatches, knowing that I won't be able to open my windows for at least another 7 months, until after Halloween or later.  

I don't hate the summer and I love Florida all year round.  But I especially love the cool air -- being able to smell flowers, listen to birds without the sound of the A/C, smell the rain, have a fresh breeze blowing thru.

In this part of florida being above 95 degrees is common in the summer. The female is often in a wire crate because she jumps the fence and escapes daily. The only reason she isn't left in this crate for days at a time is she escapes. Whenever she escapes she comes to our front door and will often get into our backyard and try to kill our chickens, or try to force herself in through our front door. We do not feed her or let her in our house ever, but she consistently comes back.

I feel bad for them, but can anything actually be done. The crate has water and there is shade in the backyard. They are left our regarless of the rainstorms (even tornado warnings) or heat. Whenever they get out the neighbors apologize and say they'll ""handle it"" but these conditions are inhumane, and it's putting our pets lives at risk everytime she jumps into our backyard.

My husband and I are planning to go somewhere for my spring break - end of March.  I know this is prime spring breaker time.  We would love to be somewhere away from drunk college kids and screaming children (no kids of our own and I'm a teacher so I need a break from them).  No interest in any theme parks or nightlife.  We love national parks, hiking, wildlife, botanical gardens, maybe a nice seafood dinner or two (but don't mind cooking for ourselves).  I know basically every beach will be crowded at this time, and we'd be willing to deal with that for a couple of beach days as long as it was a more chill vibe.  We thought it'd be cool to try our hand at snorkeling.  A boat ride of some sort would be cool.

Any recommendations for areas to look into?  We'd prefer an airbnb or private home rental (if it had a private pool I'd be in absolute heaven) and will probably rent a car after flying in.

I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating.

565,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

572,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, hate",My first attempt at taking pictures of the Milky Way. Taken in Gulf Hammock.,"I drove about 1 1/2 hours from home last night to a small community called Gulf Hammock in Florida because the light pollution map shows, gray, or basically no light pollution in the area. The sky was actually clear, so I was lucky knowing that there are almost always clouds during the Florida summers and especially in light of the fact that a tropical system is coming to Florida. 
I parked close to the post office, which had the only lights in the area. I looked up and I could see the Milky Way somewhat faintly. Around 1 am, I took these 2 pictures of the Milky Way with my iPhone 14 Pro Max with 10 seconds of exposure. It was my first night attempting to take Milky Way pictures, but they look decent to me. Both pictures are similar, but I edited one of them. The dark picture is unedited. The bright picture I increased the exposure, the brilliance, and the brightness all the way up with the iPhone’s photo app, so no photo editing software has been used for these pictures. The tree looks red on the pictures because my hazard lights were flashing because I was parked in the road away from the post office lights, but I think that the red creates a nice touch to it.
Now to my inquiries. First, what do you think about my Milky Way pictures and how they came out? Second, which of the 2 pictures is better, the unedited or the edited one? 
Not many dark sky locations left nor opportunities weather-wise in Florida to take pictures of the Milky Way.",2024-08-03 20:06:09

someone suggested i consider installing a mini-split for the garage instead of doing storage. my garage door is already insulated, although its not an impact door, if that matters.

576,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, enjoy",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

I love that I live in a place where I can get on my bike and ride somewhere. But I struggle to take advantage of this in the summer. There is so much planning I need to do in order to not die from the heat. And then I can only be out for so long in the sun before I feel sick.

A lot of times I end up staying inside all day, paralyzed by trying to make the decision to go out while also trying to plan for all that would entail. A lot of the things I would prefer to do indoors tend to be out of budget for me - things like going to the movies or out to eat or shopping at the mall.

587,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, enjoy",What has happened to Florida?,"I grew up in FL and moved away when I was 20. While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous.

597,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, enjoy",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

***edit, post vacation: if anyone find this post later and wants to know what worked, I used la roche posay 60 SPF sunscreen, one made for the body and a dry touch one for face,  and reapplied every 4 hours, wore a sun hat sometimes, and got a very lightweight SPF zip up jacket that i wore once on the warmest day when I could feel the sun starting to get bad. I successfully did not get sunburnt! I got a little bit of a tan but no significant burn (other than a spot I missed on my nose one day), and spent pretty much the whole week outside. So there is hope for us pasty pale people! Also they weren’t kidding about needing sunglasses- thank god I ordered some prescription ones beforehand, if you need similar DO IT.

cost of living, forget about it, insurance, forget about it, weather? how many years have these wildfires been happening?

For christs sake, you people have NO INCOME TAX!!!! Only a handful of states in the US have this privilege, and florida is the only one with good beaches. No income tax, wonderful destinations, plenty of jobs, yall have alot to be grateful for.  Id KILL for no income tax, thats literally a gift from god. Most people have to fight tooth and nail to evade taxes, but your government just hands it to you on a silver platter. Ive lived in florida, and ive lived in the sapphire blue toilet bowl on the other side of the country, trust me, Id take FL any day.

Im not trying to paint this as a left or right thing, I identify as socially left and economically right, so I am  not taking a side here. but seriously yall need to appreciate what you have that us in other states (CA, NC,SC) dont have at all.

I understand some of yall dont like desantis and dont like his social policy, fair enough (although that new alimony law should have won some of you socially left people over, alimony is a patriarchal construct in the first place)

but come on, what NON-SOCIAL (I repeat, NON-SOCIAL) policies do you have or not have in florida that you think california does better? as someone whos lived in both, Im genuinely curious

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating. I'd be giving up everything I love, even down to the food, weather, and geography.

629,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, enjoy","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

I’m 37 and I live with my parents. I make 67,000 a year and cannot afford my own place, I SHOULD HATE transplants according to y’all’s, but guess what? I don’t. You know why? Because that’s the name of the game, that’s right.

Florida is essentially developed swampland, sure but Florida has a desirable climate, low taxes, and lots of corporations are moving here. Home prices here have gone up FASTER than the average ever since the invention of home air conditioning, florida has always had more inflow for most of y’all’s lives, for a reason.

I own a cabin in Anchorage AK, I bought it to fish, and avoid paying taxes on a work bonus. I’d kill myself if I had to live there. Believe it or not, but most people don’t like the cold. Most of the land area in the US gets pretty cold(below freezing lows for at least 1/3 of the year) and people are free to spend their money and move wherever they want.

Supply and demand forces are at play, many of us who are not homeowners may never own a home here, it sucks BIG, but that’s how it works. Same shit happened in Hawaii, bulldozed native homes to build ostentatious beachfront homes, LA, San Diego, Phoenix, Arizona, you think you’re special?. That’s just the name of game, jit. That’s how capitalism works. Prices don’t go up because it sucks living here. The brutal winters in NYC sucked asshole. The summer “nights” at the cabin suck asshole.

Every place with a appealing climate is gonna get rocked with not affordable CoL, that’s how it works, that’s how it has worked and it’s how it will always work.

Don’t have a gripe because people want to live in a nicer place, with nicer weather, with nicer tax treatment. That’s petty, makes you look childish.

If you’re dead set on hating someone because you’ll never own a home here, hate Airbnb, OpenDoor, and Zillow, don’t hate people because they see an opportunity to live a better life, fuck that.

638,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, enjoy",My first attempt at taking pictures of the Milky Way. Taken in Gulf Hammock.,"I drove about 1 1/2 hours from home last night to a small community called Gulf Hammock in Florida because the light pollution map shows, gray, or basically no light pollution in the area. The sky was actually clear, so I was lucky knowing that there are almost always clouds during the Florida summers and especially in light of the fact that a tropical system is coming to Florida. 
I parked close to the post office, which had the only lights in the area. I looked up and I could see the Milky Way somewhat faintly. Around 1 am, I took these 2 pictures of the Milky Way with my iPhone 14 Pro Max with 10 seconds of exposure. It was my first night attempting to take Milky Way pictures, but they look decent to me. Both pictures are similar, but I edited one of them. The dark picture is unedited. The bright picture I increased the exposure, the brilliance, and the brightness all the way up with the iPhone’s photo app, so no photo editing software has been used for these pictures. The tree looks red on the pictures because my hazard lights were flashing because I was parked in the road away from the post office lights, but I think that the red creates a nice touch to it.
Now to my inquiries. First, what do you think about my Milky Way pictures and how they came out? Second, which of the 2 pictures is better, the unedited or the edited one? 
Not many dark sky locations left nor opportunities weather-wise in Florida to take pictures of the Milky Way.",2024-08-03 20:06:09

Lots of rain, but zero lightning. At least not where I’ve been. Today we drove Sarasota to Tampa- rain clouds were everywhere- but like I mentioned- dispersed. And zero lightning.

651,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, dislike",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

655,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, dislike",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

668,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, dislike","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06

Born here, bought a house here, sold a house here, moved to NYC, moved back and now I can’t afford a comparable house because mine went up 175% since I sold it in 2019.

I’m 37 and I live with my parents. I make 67,000 a year and cannot afford my own place, I SHOULD HATE transplants according to y’all’s, but guess what? I don’t. You know why? Because that’s the name of the game, that’s right.

Florida is essentially developed swampland, sure but Florida has a desirable climate, low taxes, and lots of corporations are moving here. Home prices here have gone up FASTER than the average ever since the invention of home air conditioning, florida has always had more inflow for most of y’all’s lives, for a reason.

I own a cabin in Anchorage AK, I bought it to fish, and avoid paying taxes on a work bonus. I’d kill myself if I had to live there. Believe it or not, but most people don’t like the cold. Most of the land area in the US gets pretty cold(below freezing lows for at least 1/3 of the year) and people are free to spend their money and move wherever they want.

Supply and demand forces are at play, many of us who are not homeowners may never own a home here, it sucks BIG, but that’s how it works. Same shit happened in Hawaii, bulldozed native homes to build ostentatious beachfront homes, LA, San Diego, Phoenix, Arizona, you think you’re special?. That’s just the name of game, jit. That’s how capitalism works. Prices don’t go up because it sucks living here. The brutal winters in NYC sucked asshole. The summer “nights” at the cabin suck asshole.

Every place with a appealing climate is gonna get rocked with not affordable CoL, that’s how it works, that’s how it has worked and it’s how it will always work.

Don’t have a gripe because people want to live in a nicer place, with nicer weather, with nicer tax treatment. That’s petty, makes you look childish.

If you’re dead set on hating someone because you’ll never own a home here, hate Airbnb, OpenDoor, and Zillow, don’t hate people because they see an opportunity to live a better life, fuck that.

Snowbirds though… fuck em(because they don’t contribute to society and drive like crap) but once again, what can you do, they got the money, they’re gonna do what they’re gonna do.",2023-01-15 03:22:03

Taken in Gulf Hammock.,"I drove about 1 1/2 hours from home last night to a small community called Gulf Hammock in Florida because the light pollution map shows, gray, or basically no light pollution in the area. The sky was actually clear, so I was lucky knowing that there are almost always clouds during the Florida summers and especially in light of the fact that a tropical system is coming to Florida. 
I parked close to the post office, which had the only lights in the area. I looked up and I could see the Milky Way somewhat faintly. Around 1 am, I took these 2 pictures of the Milky Way with my iPhone 14 Pro Max with 10 seconds of exposure. It was my first night attempting to take Milky Way pictures, but they look decent to me. Both pictures are similar, but I edited one of them. The dark picture is unedited. The bright picture I increased the exposure, the brilliance, and the brightness all the way up with the iPhone’s photo app, so no photo editing software has been used for these pictures. The tree looks red on the pictures because my hazard lights were flashing because I was parked in the road away from the post office lights, but I think that the red creates a nice touch to it.
Now to my inquiries. First, what do you think about my Milky Way pictures and how they came out? Second, which of the 2 pictures is better, the unedited or the edited one?

I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

In North Carolina our entire spring/summer has been consistently around 95 degrees with some days reaching 101 easily, it’s nearly 80 degrees at night lol yet I’ve seen nothing but Florida tags here as if everyone from Florida is moving here or the fact that Florida seems to be less hot than it is here, I don’t get it. Is it also because Florida seems to have less trees (shade) on public roads? Can someone explain this lol",2023-07-22 07:09:40
714,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, annoying","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06
715,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, annoying",The hating/circlejerking on transplants is uncalled for and sad,"Obligatory “Born here”. Born here, bought a house here, sold a house here, moved to NYC, moved back and now I can’t afford a comparable house because mine went up 175% since I sold it in 2019.

I’m 37 and I live with my parents. I make 67,000 a year and cannot afford my own place, I SHOULD HATE transplants according to y’all’s, but guess what? I don’t. You know why? Because that’s the name of the game, that’s right.

Florida is essentially developed swampland, sure but Florida has a desirable climate, low taxes, and lots of corporations are moving here. Home prices here have gone up FASTER than the average ever since the invention of home air conditioning, florida has always had more inflow for most of y’all’s lives, for a reason.

I own a cabin in Anchorage AK, I bought it to fish, and avoid paying taxes on a work bonus. I’d kill myself if I had to live there. Believe it or not, but most people don’t like the cold. Most of the land area in the US gets pretty cold(below freezing lows for at least 1/3 of the year) and people are free to spend their money and move wherever they want.

Supply and demand forces are at play, many of us who are not homeowners may never own a home here, it sucks BIG, but that’s how it works. Same shit happened in Hawaii, bulldozed native homes to build ostentatious beachfront homes, LA, San Diego, Phoenix, Arizona, you think you’re special?. That’s just the name of game, jit. That’s how capitalism works. Prices don’t go up because it sucks living here. The brutal winters in NYC sucked asshole. The summer “nights” at the cabin suck asshole.

Every place with a appealing climate is gonna get rocked with not affordable CoL, that’s how it works, that’s how it has worked and it’s how it will always work.

Don’t have a gripe because people want to live in a nicer place, with nicer weather, with nicer tax treatment. That’s petty, makes you look childish.

If you’re dead set on hating someone because you’ll never own a home here, hate Airbnb, OpenDoor, and Zillow, don’t hate people because they see an opportunity to live a better life, fuck that.

Snowbirds though… fuck em(because they don’t contribute to society and drive like crap) but once again, what can you do, they got the money, they’re gonna do what they’re gonna do.",2023-01-15 03:22:03

719,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, annoying",My first attempt at taking pictures of the Milky Way. Taken in Gulf Hammock.,"I drove about 1 1/2 hours from home last night to a small community called Gulf Hammock in Florida because the light pollution map shows, gray, or basically no light pollution in the area. The sky was actually clear, so I was lucky knowing that there are almost always clouds during the Florida summers and especially in light of the fact that a tropical system is coming to Florida. 
I parked close to the post office, which had the only lights in the area. I looked up and I could see the Milky Way somewhat faintly. Around 1 am, I took these 2 pictures of the Milky Way with my iPhone 14 Pro Max with 10 seconds of exposure. It was my first night attempting to take Milky Way pictures, but they look decent to me. Both pictures are similar, but I edited one of them. The dark picture is unedited. The bright picture I increased the exposure, the brilliance, and the brightness all the way up with the iPhone’s photo app, so no photo editing software has been used for these pictures. The tree looks red on the pictures because my hazard lights were flashing because I was parked in the road away from the post office lights, but I think that the red creates a nice touch to it.
Now to my inquiries. First, what do you think about my Milky Way pictures and how they came out? Second, which of the 2 pictures is better, the unedited or the edited one?

Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

750,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, happy",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

For christs sake, you people have NO INCOME TAX!!!! Only a handful of states in the US have this privilege, and florida is the only one with good beaches. No income tax, wonderful destinations, plenty of jobs, yall have alot to be grateful for.  Id KILL for no income tax, thats literally a gift from god. Most people have to fight tooth and nail to evade taxes, but your government just hands it to you on a silver platter. Ive lived in florida, and ive lived in the sapphire blue toilet bowl on the other side of the country, trust me, Id take FL any day.

Im not trying to paint this as a left or right thing, I identify as socially left and economically right, so I am  not taking a side here. but seriously yall need to appreciate what you have that us in other states (CA, NC,SC) dont have at all.

I understand some of yall dont like desantis and dont like his social policy, fair enough (although that new alimony law should have won some of you socially left people over, alimony is a patriarchal construct in the first place)

[Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03

762,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US – all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07

767,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, happy","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06

769,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‘Dial *FHP for emergency’.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‘soon’.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it’s not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can’t see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‘escorting’ a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‘wide load’ sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm…) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while…. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, “Now that you’ve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?”  The response: “Sir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.” I’ll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy’s awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left.

770,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, happy",The hating/circlejerking on transplants is uncalled for and sad,"Obligatory “Born here”. Born here, bought a house here, sold a house here, moved to NYC, moved back and now I can’t afford a comparable house because mine went up 175% since I sold it in 2019.

I’m 37 and I live with my parents. I make 67,000 a year and cannot afford my own place, I SHOULD HATE transplants according to y’all’s, but guess what? I don’t. You know why? Because that’s the name of the game, that’s right.

Florida is essentially developed swampland, sure but Florida has a desirable climate, low taxes, and lots of corporations are moving here. Home prices here have gone up FASTER than the average ever since the invention of home air conditioning, florida has always had more inflow for most of y’all’s lives, for a reason.

I own a cabin in Anchorage AK, I bought it to fish, and avoid paying taxes on a work bonus. I’d kill myself if I had to live there. Believe it or not, but most people don’t like the cold. Most of the land area in the US gets pretty cold(below freezing lows for at least 1/3 of the year) and people are free to spend their money and move wherever they want.

Supply and demand forces are at play, many of us who are not homeowners may never own a home here, it sucks BIG, but that’s how it works. Same shit happened in Hawaii, bulldozed native homes to build ostentatious beachfront homes, LA, San Diego, Phoenix, Arizona, you think you’re special?. That’s just the name of game, jit. That’s how capitalism works. Prices don’t go up because it sucks living here. The brutal winters in NYC sucked asshole. The summer “nights” at the cabin suck asshole.

Every place with a appealing climate is gonna get rocked with not affordable CoL, that’s how it works, that’s how it has worked and it’s how it will always work.

Don’t have a gripe because people want to live in a nicer place, with nicer weather, with nicer tax treatment. That’s petty, makes you look childish.

If you’re dead set on hating someone because you’ll never own a home here, hate Airbnb, OpenDoor, and Zillow, don’t hate people because they see an opportunity to live a better life, fuck that.

Snowbirds though… fuck em(because they don’t contribute to society and drive like crap) but once again, what can you do, they got the money, they’re gonna do what they’re gonna do.",2023-01-15 03:22:03

774,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, happy",My first attempt at taking pictures of the Milky Way. Taken in Gulf Hammock.,"I drove about 1 1/2 hours from home last night to a small community called Gulf Hammock in Florida because the light pollution map shows, gray, or basically no light pollution in the area. The sky was actually clear, so I was lucky knowing that there are almost always clouds during the Florida summers and especially in light of the fact that a tropical system is coming to Florida. 
I parked close to the post office, which had the only lights in the area. I looked up and I could see the Milky Way somewhat faintly. Around 1 am, I took these 2 pictures of the Milky Way with my iPhone 14 Pro Max with 10 seconds of exposure. It was my first night attempting to take Milky Way pictures, but they look decent to me. Both pictures are similar, but I edited one of them. The dark picture is unedited. The bright picture I increased the exposure, the brilliance, and the brightness all the way up with the iPhone’s photo app, so no photo editing software has been used for these pictures. The tree looks red on the pictures because my hazard lights were flashing because I was parked in the road away from the post office lights, but I think that the red creates a nice touch to it.
Now to my inquiries. First, what do you think about my Milky Way pictures and how they came out? Second, which of the 2 pictures is better, the unedited or the edited one?

For all of you looking to stay cool during the summer months and keep your electricity bill low. I suggest looking into getting a mini split system for your place. 

They're extremely energy efficient and will blow ice cold air keeping your place nice and cool. Also they are surprisingly affordable (I bought mine on Amazon for $1300 for a 2 room system).

Now obviously alot of people can't throw down that kind of money for a system but if it helps anyone else looking to stay cool for a low cost system and lower power bill then im happy I can help out my Floridians. ",2024-04-09 15:49:03

802,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, annoyed",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

814,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, annoyed","I want to move to FL, sorry😅","I know a lot of times y’all don’t appreciate out-of-state people coming in and crowding you out, but I’ve just fallen in love with the state. The natural beauty, and especially the marine environment down there is just perfection, even if there isn’t much left.

I’m from Western New York and have been lurking in this sub for a few months now. I know y’all have your problems, and all the politics down there is a complete shitshow, but I’m kinda used to being around crazy. Up here we have crazy Trumpers too, and it can get just as bad.

I’m not gonna just move because of the weather (although that is part of it), but because I want to work with corals and the ocean. I’m hoping to graduate with my Chemistry degree this summer from an environmental school here in NY. I’ve been applying to aquariums and reef institutions hoping to get a position down there. I know a lot of people say the reefs are done for, but I still think they can be saved.

I didn’t pay too much attention to the actual temperature when I was there but after researching, every source says the average temperature in Florida is around 82-86 degrees Fahrenheit. Is this a joke? Or are the complaints more so the heat being year around and not seasonal?

816,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, annoyed","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06
817,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, annoyed",The hating/circlejerking on transplants is uncalled for and sad,"Obligatory “Born here”. Born here, bought a house here, sold a house here, moved to NYC, moved back and now I can’t afford a comparable house because mine went up 175% since I sold it in 2019.

I’m 37 and I live with my parents. I make 67,000 a year and cannot afford my own place, I SHOULD HATE transplants according to y’all’s, but guess what? I don’t. You know why? Because that’s the name of the game, that’s right.

Florida is essentially developed swampland, sure but Florida has a desirable climate, low taxes, and lots of corporations are moving here. Home prices here have gone up FASTER than the average ever since the invention of home air conditioning, florida has always had more inflow for most of y’all’s lives, for a reason.

I own a cabin in Anchorage AK, I bought it to fish, and avoid paying taxes on a work bonus. I’d kill myself if I had to live there. Believe it or not, but most people don’t like the cold. Most of the land area in the US gets pretty cold(below freezing lows for at least 1/3 of the year) and people are free to spend their money and move wherever they want.

Supply and demand forces are at play, many of us who are not homeowners may never own a home here, it sucks BIG, but that’s how it works. Same shit happened in Hawaii, bulldozed native homes to build ostentatious beachfront homes, LA, San Diego, Phoenix, Arizona, you think you’re special?. That’s just the name of game, jit. That’s how capitalism works. Prices don’t go up because it sucks living here. The brutal winters in NYC sucked asshole. The summer “nights” at the cabin suck asshole.

Every place with a appealing climate is gonna get rocked with not affordable CoL, that’s how it works, that’s how it has worked and it’s how it will always work.

Don’t have a gripe because people want to live in a nicer place, with nicer weather, with nicer tax treatment. That’s petty, makes you look childish.

If you’re dead set on hating someone because you’ll never own a home here, hate Airbnb, OpenDoor, and Zillow, don’t hate people because they see an opportunity to live a better life, fuck that.

Snowbirds though… fuck em(because they don’t contribute to society and drive like crap) but once again, what can you do, they got the money, they’re gonna do what they’re gonna do.",2023-01-15 03:22:03

821,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, annoyed",My first attempt at taking pictures of the Milky Way. Taken in Gulf Hammock.,"I drove about 1 1/2 hours from home last night to a small community called Gulf Hammock in Florida because the light pollution map shows, gray, or basically no light pollution in the area. The sky was actually clear, so I was lucky knowing that there are almost always clouds during the Florida summers and especially in light of the fact that a tropical system is coming to Florida. 
I parked close to the post office, which had the only lights in the area. I looked up and I could see the Milky Way somewhat faintly. Around 1 am, I took these 2 pictures of the Milky Way with my iPhone 14 Pro Max with 10 seconds of exposure. It was my first night attempting to take Milky Way pictures, but they look decent to me. Both pictures are similar, but I edited one of them. The dark picture is unedited. The bright picture I increased the exposure, the brilliance, and the brightness all the way up with the iPhone’s photo app, so no photo editing software has been used for these pictures. The tree looks red on the pictures because my hazard lights were flashing because I was parked in the road away from the post office lights, but I think that the red creates a nice touch to it.
Now to my inquiries. First, what do you think about my Milky Way pictures and how they came out? Second, which of the 2 pictures is better, the unedited or the edited one?

I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean.

Should I be concerned about Hurricane Milton? I read that it is normal to prepare bottled water, canned food, flashlight and batteries, first aid kit etc. in case of a hurricane. Should I just watch it for the next 2 or so days or just prepare early? I don't know what I should be doing right now. We were only mildly effected by Helene and the path wasn't close so I didn't do anything in preparation but this time we could be right in the center of it.

I (22M) stayed in the beautiful city of Melbourne last year for 3 months for a summer engineering internship, and by the end, I wanted to move there

Im finishing 3 months this year in Silicon Valley for another internship.

I have to know, what is with all the hatred on this sub? Some of the common points I see when people are hating on Fl are 1) cost of living, 2) weather, 3) insurance companies leaving.

.....do you people realize all these things are like 10x worse in California?

cost of living, forget about it, insurance, forget about it, weather? how many years have these wildfires been happening?

For christs sake, you people have NO INCOME TAX!!!! Only a handful of states in the US have this privilege, and florida is the only one with good beaches. No income tax, wonderful destinations, plenty of jobs, yall have alot to be grateful for.  Id KILL for no income tax, thats literally a gift from god. Most people have to fight tooth and nail to evade taxes, but your government just hands it to you on a silver platter. Ive lived in florida, and ive lived in the sapphire blue toilet bowl on the other side of the country, trust me, Id take FL any day.

Im not trying to paint this as a left or right thing, I identify as socially left and economically right, so I am  not taking a side here. but seriously yall need to appreciate what you have that us in other states (CA, NC,SC) dont have at all.

I understand some of yall dont like desantis and dont like his social policy, fair enough (although that new alimony law should have won some of you socially left people over, alimony is a patriarchal construct in the first place)

but come on, what NON-SOCIAL (I repeat, NON-SOCIAL) policies do you have or not have in florida that you think california does better? as someone whos lived in both, Im genuinely curious

861,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, comfortable","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06

Born here, bought a house here, sold a house here, moved to NYC, moved back and now I can’t afford a comparable house because mine went up 175% since I sold it in 2019.

I’m 37 and I live with my parents. I make 67,000 a year and cannot afford my own place, I SHOULD HATE transplants according to y’all’s, but guess what? I don’t. You know why? Because that’s the name of the game, that’s right.

Florida is essentially developed swampland, sure but Florida has a desirable climate, low taxes, and lots of corporations are moving here. Home prices here have gone up FASTER than the average ever since the invention of home air conditioning, florida has always had more inflow for most of y’all’s lives, for a reason.

I own a cabin in Anchorage AK, I bought it to fish, and avoid paying taxes on a work bonus. I’d kill myself if I had to live there. Believe it or not, but most people don’t like the cold. Most of the land area in the US gets pretty cold(below freezing lows for at least 1/3 of the year) and people are free to spend their money and move wherever they want.

Supply and demand forces are at play, many of us who are not homeowners may never own a home here, it sucks BIG, but that’s how it works. Same shit happened in Hawaii, bulldozed native homes to build ostentatious beachfront homes, LA, San Diego, Phoenix, Arizona, you think you’re special?. That’s just the name of game, jit. That’s how capitalism works. Prices don’t go up because it sucks living here. The brutal winters in NYC sucked asshole. The summer “nights” at the cabin suck asshole.

Every place with a appealing climate is gonna get rocked with not affordable CoL, that’s how it works, that’s how it has worked and it’s how it will always work.

Don’t have a gripe because people want to live in a nicer place, with nicer weather, with nicer tax treatment. That’s petty, makes you look childish.

If you’re dead set on hating someone because you’ll never own a home here, hate Airbnb, OpenDoor, and Zillow, don’t hate people because they see an opportunity to live a better life, fuck that.

The sky was actually clear, so I was lucky knowing that there are almost always clouds during the Florida summers and especially in light of the fact that a tropical system is coming to Florida. 
I parked close to the post office, which had the only lights in the area. I looked up and I could see the Milky Way somewhat faintly. Around 1 am, I took these 2 pictures of the Milky Way with my iPhone 14 Pro Max with 10 seconds of exposure. It was my first night attempting to take Milky Way pictures, but they look decent to me. Both pictures are similar, but I edited one of them. The dark picture is unedited. The bright picture I increased the exposure, the brilliance, and the brightness all the way up with the iPhone’s photo app, so no photo editing software has been used for these pictures. The tree looks red on the pictures because my hazard lights were flashing because I was parked in the road away from the post office lights, but I think that the red creates a nice touch to it.

I volunteer for a non-profit that organizes free, grief/bereavement camps for children, age 7 - 17, who lost a parent, sibling, or other loved one/family member.

It's called Comfort Zone Camp (based in Virginia, but they have camps in other states, including Florida).

The next FL camp is during weekend of April 21 - 23.

https://comfortzonecamp.org/calendar

They also offer camps in California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia.

The camps usually are Friday afternoon until Sunday afternoon.

The following videos are old, but show what the camp is about -

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbk2Pigfb_U

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLwYyfpwfHU

Regarding the camping aspect...this is not tent camping.

Think of it like a summer camp where school children go and stay in cabins...so they usually use established/developed venues.

Cabins with bunk beds, restrooms with flush toilets, sinks with running water, showers, a dining room where the kitchen staff prepares meals, etc.

Volunteers typically bring their own sleeping bag, pillow, blanket, etc...but there's no need to bring other camping equipment/gear (e.g. tent, air mattress/mad/pad, stove, etc.).

If anyone is new and interested in helping, they require attending an orientation and passing a criminal background check. Children's safety is important, and multiple adult volunteers and staff will be present (in other words, no child is ever alone with an adult).

The next 2-day orientation training meeting is via Zoom:

March 27 - 28, Mon & Tues, 6:30 pm - 8:30 pm EST

https://comfortzonecamp.org/event/5851

To attend their online training meeting, click the aforementioned website above to sign up.

Some volunteers are young adults (college students, recent graduates, etc.) and some are middle age to older adults too. Kids tend to like volunteers who are friendly, fun, positive, silly, etc.

The camp is during April 21 - 23, and in Fruitland Park.

It's north of Orlando and Tampa.

It's south of Gainesville and Jacksonville.

Many people are busy, and committing an entire weekend is challenging, but maybe someone out there is good with kids, can be a positive role model (like a big brother/big sister), and is interested in helping some kids deal with grief and loss.

If anyone is serious or curious about learning more, check out their website and videos.

If interested in helping, follow their instructions on how to sign up at https://comfortzonecamp.org/volunteers

Attend the new volunteer training on Monday & Tuesday night (March 27 & 28).

Pass a criminal background check.

And have a fun time during camp, April 21 - 23. It's a life-changing experience for both kids and adults imo.

p.s.

If anyone knows a parent with a child(ren) who has experienced loss, please feel free to share with them about this camp (again, it's free to attend), and it can be very beneficial for kids to not feel alone in coping with their sadness, pain, grief, etc.

878,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, love",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.
 
I’m curious what you all have to say.",2024-06-12 14:37:32

881,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, love",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

883,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, love",Does anyone get depression from the heat?,"I’ve heard of people getting Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) when it gets too cold in northern climates, but I feel like I have the reverse of that.

Does anyone else feel that way? Everyone around me seems to love this heat and I’m feeling like I’m the odd one out. I’m wondering if it is just something where other people aren’t used to this and it feels novel to them, while I’ve grown up around it. I wonder if this is how other people feel about the cold. I visited Canada a few years back (in the dead of winter) and the lack of people and the snow was just amazing to me.

I can't be the only one that gets a little depressed in these summer months. With all of the beautiful sunshine, I should be enjoying time outside, right? But this is hard because of how hot it is. I want to go to the beach but the water there isn't even refreshing because it's so hot. It's also very crowded.

I love that I live in a place where I can get on my bike and ride somewhere. But I struggle to take advantage of this in the summer. There is so much planning I need to do in order to not die from the heat. And then I can only be out for so long in the sun before I feel sick.

A lot of times I end up staying inside all day, paralyzed by trying to make the decision to go out while also trying to plan for all that would entail. A lot of the things I would prefer to do indoors tend to be out of budget for me - things like going to the movies or out to eat or shopping at the mall. I end up feeling guilty because I should be grateful that I get to live in this great state but am not taking advantage of all it has to offer during these months.

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing.

First, thank you all for the responses. They are so helpful.
To clarify, my family is composed of all adults over 25. We are quite a fit family and like the heat and love the ocean and beaches. August is the only month that was possible for us to get a vacation together as a whole family of 4.

**My notes:**
1. Get sunscreen. A lot of it!
2. Stay hydrated and bring plenty of water.
3. Wear UV-protective clothing.
4. Drive carefully and be nice to everyone.
5. Spend more days in the Keys area and less time in Fort Myers and Sarasota. Go to Tampa/St. Pete instead.

But I find it entertaining whenever I visit. I live in CT where it’s great and safe but so uneventful it gets boring/depressing, especially since it’s cold from Oct-April. So whenever I visit FL (Tampa Bay and Miami) I feel “alive”. From what I’ve seen is just a normal state where people live normal lives, nothing out of this world. I’m sure it’s different when you live there. Besides the weather, what’s so bad about it?

894,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, love",Moved to Miami and here’s my Take. (Warning),"So after living and Moving out of Miami here’s my not so great take on it.
*Low Pay high cost of living/Slave State
(I felt like I worked in an all inclusive)
*Vacation vs Living here is completely different 
(I obviously expected this but it’s really really different.)
*People say the “N” word a lot like overtly
* Driving reminded me of driving in Costa Rica obviously better paved but really reckless.
* A lot of Spanish which was good because I knew a bit and learned a lot.
*Service wise people try to take advantage of you almost all the time.
*The weather is Brutal
(The constant heat, rain, floods, hurricane warnings which they make it seem like the worlds going to end and puts your nerves on edge) Did I mention flood driving… Anxiety on a new level lol
*Mosquitos run in packs and I’ve never been so bit up in my life, keep bug spray on you.
*Top 10 Cockroach infestation in the country
* People weren’t the kindest out here that’s for sure and I was treated super weird going into certain restaurants not knowing Spanish.
*Allergies
(I hardly have allergies but apparently the mold due to the high humidity and pollen was pretty intense)
This seems to be what I was told which it’s a great retirement place.
I recently moved out, went back to where I can pay 1400 for a 1 bedroom, Make more money, save money and visit Miami for a few weeks and head back home to continue saving money for my retirement. Moving there was a whirlwind and if you can make it out there good for you but nothing in the world would make me want to move back unless I hit the lotto and even then I don’t like the hurricanes and flooding so I’d still probably pass and only vacation there. You’ll loose years of your life trying to keep up with bills along with the lifestyle.
Anyways this is my personal experience, I thought I’d share just in case someone was looking into moving there. 
Oh also the employment market is overtly saturated, keep in mind that about 22Million people live in Florida so they can easily find someone to underpay for the position you applied for and they have people lined up for it.

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

But I have this fear, it always seems like everybody is talking about leaving Florida, but they never seem to actually do it.  Furthermore, people who do, it often seems like they end up back in short time.  One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.  

So what I am asking here, is there any success stories from former Floridians who moved away and loved it? Or just anybody who can share some experiences?

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

917,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, hate",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

920,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

926,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, hate",Moved to Miami and here’s my Take. (Warning),"So after living and Moving out of Miami here’s my not so great take on it.
*Low Pay high cost of living/Slave State
(I felt like I worked in an all inclusive)
*Vacation vs Living here is completely different 
(I obviously expected this but it’s really really different.)
*People say the “N” word a lot like overtly
* Driving reminded me of driving in Costa Rica obviously better paved but really reckless.
* A lot of Spanish which was good because I knew a bit and learned a lot.
*Service wise people try to take advantage of you almost all the time.
*The weather is Brutal
(The constant heat, rain, floods, hurricane warnings which they make it seem like the worlds going to end and puts your nerves on edge) Did I mention flood driving… Anxiety on a new level lol
*Mosquitos run in packs and I’ve never been so bit up in my life, keep bug spray on you.
*Top 10 Cockroach infestation in the country
* People weren’t the kindest out here that’s for sure and I was treated super weird going into certain restaurants not knowing Spanish.
*Allergies
(I hardly have allergies but apparently the mold due to the high humidity and pollen was pretty intense)
This seems to be what I was told which it’s a great retirement place.
I recently moved out, went back to where I can pay 1400 for a 1 bedroom, Make more money, save money and visit Miami for a few weeks and head back home to continue saving money for my retirement. Moving there was a whirlwind and if you can make it out there good for you but nothing in the world would make me want to move back unless I hit the lotto and even then I don’t like the hurricanes and flooding so I’d still probably pass and only vacation there. You’ll loose years of your life trying to keep up with bills along with the lifestyle.
Anyways this is my personal experience, I thought I’d share just in case someone was looking into moving there. 
Oh also the employment market is overtly saturated, keep in mind that about 22Million people live in Florida so they can easily find someone to underpay for the position you applied for and they have people lined up for it.

Nice to see some justice in our country again and helping me look at the better side of things.  I've been so focused on my disgust of DeSantis and the policy makers here, the school board in Sarasota where my children go to school and so on that I've stopped taking time to appreciate some of the special things about Florida that I love.  So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

Im finishing 3 months this year in Silicon Valley for another internship.

I have to know, what is with all the hatred on this sub? Some of the common points I see when people are hating on Fl are 1) cost of living, 2) weather, 3) insurance companies leaving.

cost of living, forget about it, insurance, forget about it, weather? how many years have these wildfires been happening?

For christs sake, you people have NO INCOME TAX!!!! Only a handful of states in the US have this privilege, and florida is the only one with good beaches. No income tax, wonderful destinations, plenty of jobs, yall have alot to be grateful for.  Id KILL for no income tax, thats literally a gift from god. Most people have to fight tooth and nail to evade taxes, but your government just hands it to you on a silver platter. Ive lived in florida, and ive lived in the sapphire blue toilet bowl on the other side of the country, trust me, Id take FL any day.

Im not trying to paint this as a left or right thing, I identify as socially left and economically right, so I am  not taking a side here. but seriously yall need to appreciate what you have that us in other states (CA, NC,SC) dont have at all.

I understand some of yall dont like desantis and dont like his social policy, fair enough (although that new alimony law should have won some of you socially left people over, alimony is a patriarchal construct in the first place)

In this part of florida being above 95 degrees is common in the summer. The female is often in a wire crate because she jumps the fence and escapes daily. The only reason she isn't left in this crate for days at a time is she escapes. Whenever she escapes she comes to our front door and will often get into our backyard and try to kill our chickens, or try to force herself in through our front door. We do not feed her or let her in our house ever, but she consistently comes back.

I feel bad for them, but can anything actually be done. The crate has water and there is shade in the backyard. They are left our regarless of the rainstorms (even tornado warnings) or heat. Whenever they get out the neighbors apologize and say they'll ""handle it"" but these conditions are inhumane, and it's putting our pets lives at risk everytime she jumps into our backyard.

947,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, hate",Thinking about moving to Florida from Montana.,"Don't get me wrong, Montana is an absolutely gorgeous state with views that don't compare to many other places. However, I was born and raised in Florida, moved out of the state almost a decade ago now and every year I think about moving back but I am afraid of only being drawn back by nostalgia. I was raised in Pasco County, to give you an idea of where I'm from. I had no choice but to move, seeing as I was a minor at the time but now that I am financially stable and have nothing tying me down I've been toying with the idea to move back. I hate the winters, the snow is absolutely awful and just this last week it was -38 here in Montana. I have no love for snow sports, I love the heat and the humidity is something I'm used to. I would much rather do warm activities such as exploring, boating, hiking, and things of that nature. 

The main reason I want to move back to Florida is all my siblings live there with their kids, I am very family oriented and want to be involved in their lives. I know it's gotten far more expensive to live, but I am also moving from a place where a 1bd/1bath costs about 2,000$ a month. Car insurance here is cheap but car registration is not. Food prices are insane, but gas prices are low currently. Not to mention, the harsh conditions of the roads and the snow causes ware and tear on your vehicle. Within two months of living in Montana I had accumulated two cracks in my windshield and I stay far behind others while driving. All this to say, I am not very happy here.  Also Montana is very isolated with their cities, you have to drive at least two hours to get to another 'big' city. I like populated areas, being in the city. Yada yada. 

I've lived in Saint Louis, Detroit, and now a rinky-dink town in Montana so I am no stranger to extremely populated areas with high crime rates, low pay, and extremely populated areas.

956,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings.

I’m 37 and I live with my parents. I make 67,000 a year and cannot afford my own place, I SHOULD HATE transplants according to y’all’s, but guess what? I don’t. You know why? Because that’s the name of the game, that’s right.

Florida is essentially developed swampland, sure but Florida has a desirable climate, low taxes, and lots of corporations are moving here. Home prices here have gone up FASTER than the average ever since the invention of home air conditioning, florida has always had more inflow for most of y’all’s lives, for a reason.

I own a cabin in Anchorage AK, I bought it to fish, and avoid paying taxes on a work bonus. I’d kill myself if I had to live there. Believe it or not, but most people don’t like the cold. Most of the land area in the US gets pretty cold(below freezing lows for at least 1/3 of the year) and people are free to spend their money and move wherever they want.

Supply and demand forces are at play, many of us who are not homeowners may never own a home here, it sucks BIG, but that’s how it works. Same shit happened in Hawaii, bulldozed native homes to build ostentatious beachfront homes, LA, San Diego, Phoenix, Arizona, you think you’re special?. That’s just the name of game, jit. That’s how capitalism works. Prices don’t go up because it sucks living here. The brutal winters in NYC sucked asshole. The summer “nights” at the cabin suck asshole.

Every place with a appealing climate is gonna get rocked with not affordable CoL, that’s how it works, that’s how it has worked and it’s how it will always work.

Don’t have a gripe because people want to live in a nicer place, with nicer weather, with nicer tax treatment. That’s petty, makes you look childish.

If you’re dead set on hating someone because you’ll never own a home here, hate Airbnb, OpenDoor, and Zillow, don’t hate people because they see an opportunity to live a better life, fuck that.

some of this is in my attached two-car garage right now, but i hate how swampy it is out there; it makes it difficult to even use it as a sorting and working space, and i see things getting a little rusty and i hate wondering if things are also risking mildew. (i have pretty severe allergies.)

someone suggested i consider installing a mini-split for the garage instead of doing storage. my garage door is already insulated, although its not an impact door, if that matters. 

would this mean i would put in another tiny AC unit-thing outside, next to the garage wall? 

anyone have experience with this, good or bad? and anyone in the greater tampa bay area have a vendor or installer they recommend?",2024-06-30 21:24:35

We looked at the Hard Rock , too commercial 
We want some place that is clean looks like it’s been kept up (painted/neat) and the people are nice.

Would like to have the ceremony and reception at the same location.

Must have A/C for our northern part of family who hates the heat.

Would love something historic or traditional…but something extra special. A hotel is fine if it’s nice.

If you can’t remember the name of the place if you tell me where it’s located and the type of place I can figure it out.

Basically, I am a graduating engineer in Southern Ontario (near Toronto) and I'm unable to find a job here due to the job market.

Reasons why I want to leave Canada:

1. Terrible housing market (the low end for houses is $1M)
2. High Income Taxes
3. Terrible weather - hate the winter
4. No job opportunities

I am looking for a place where I can move with my gf (who is studying to be a dentist) to start a family. More specifically, a family friendly neighborhood.

I've visited Florida (Tampa) last August and I really loved it. Enjoyed the weather, talked to many locals who were very nice and welcoming. From my experience, Florida seems like the place to go.

I'd only be able to move there by getting a TN visa from a work sponsorship.

1. What are the biggest cons that I might face for a person in my position?
2. What city/region would you recommend for me to move to?
3. Do you think there's another state that would better suit me?",2023-04-24 22:05:38
970,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, enjoy",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.
 
I’m curious what you all have to say.",2024-06-12 14:37:32

I love that I live in a place where I can get on my bike and ride somewhere. But I struggle to take advantage of this in the summer. There is so much planning I need to do in order to not die from the heat. And then I can only be out for so long in the sun before I feel sick.

A lot of times I end up staying inside all day, paralyzed by trying to make the decision to go out while also trying to plan for all that would entail. A lot of the things I would prefer to do indoors tend to be out of budget for me - things like going to the movies or out to eat or shopping at the mall.

977,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, enjoy",What has happened to Florida?,"I grew up in FL and moved away when I was 20. While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous. 

What happened to Florida? Its literally become the playground for the far right. I dont even associate it with Publix, alligators, oranges, beaches, dolphins and Jimmy Buffett music anymore.",2023-07-03 14:00:21

*Low Pay high cost of living/Slave State
(I felt like I worked in an all inclusive)
*Vacation vs Living here is completely different 
(I obviously expected this but it’s really really different.)
*People say the “N” word a lot like overtly
* Driving reminded me of driving in Costa Rica obviously better paved but really reckless.
* A lot of Spanish which was good because I knew a bit and learned a lot.
*Service wise people try to take advantage of you almost all the time.
*The weather is Brutal
(The constant heat, rain, floods, hurricane warnings which they make it seem like the worlds going to end and puts your nerves on edge) Did I mention flood driving… Anxiety on a new level lol
*Mosquitos run in packs and I’ve never been so bit up in my life, keep bug spray on you.
*Top 10 Cockroach infestation in the country
* People weren’t the kindest out here that’s for sure and I was treated super weird going into certain restaurants not knowing Spanish.
*Allergies
(I hardly have allergies but apparently the mold due to the high humidity and pollen was pretty intense)
This seems to be what I was told which it’s a great retirement place.
I recently moved out, went back to where I can pay 1400 for a 1 bedroom, Make more money, save money and visit Miami for a few weeks and head back home to continue saving money for my retirement. Moving there was a whirlwind and if you can make it out there good for you but nothing in the world would make me want to move back unless I hit the lotto and even then I don’t like the hurricanes and flooding so I’d still probably pass and only vacation there. You’ll loose years of your life trying to keep up with bills along with the lifestyle.
Anyways this is my personal experience, I thought I’d share just in case someone was looking into moving there. 
Oh also the employment market is overtly saturated, keep in mind that about 22Million people live in Florida so they can easily find someone to underpay for the position you applied for and they have people lined up for it. Not me, I’d choose financial liberty and low cost of living every time.",2023-12-17 23:25:01

Hello everybody, 

So my kids are finally old enough to appreciate the trip from Ireland to the USA. We are doing the quintessential Europeans coming to Orlando trip.

We are coming mid July 🥵 for 14 days. There are 10 of us, my family & the inlaws. 

Me and my wife have been there several times each, most recent was with her folks in 2005 and 2007 (not counting our honeymoon to New York in 2010). So I like to think we have some sort of handle on the logistics. 

Those previous times, I was too young to drive a hire car (I was 20 on the 2007 trip). 

This time, we have 2 cars, and 2 seperate houses, so I'll be one of the lead drivers. Any tips or advice for driving around? Swapping to left hand drive is no problem for me, but certain rules of the road such as turning right on red etc is not a thing here in Ireland. I'm not nervous about it, but just looking for any tips or things to look out for. 

We will be doing parks, shopping, sightseeing.

Thanks I'm advance!

Update: Wow, the response has been incredible! Thank you, EVERYBODY, for your contributions. There has been some seriously invaluable advice given and I appreciate everyone for taking the time to drop your help below! It has reaffirmed some of my experiences from the past and given me some foresight for what to expect now I will be driving this time. 

I can't wait to bring my kids to experience what was my absolute best childhood holiday 😍 

Update!: it's currently Monday 29th, got back from 2 weeks in wonderful Orlando last Thursday morning after an overnight flight from MCO. 

As expected; the trip was amazing, the people were amazing, the parks were amazing. Everything was great. 
Unfortunately we didn't get to see and do everything on our list, we listened to the kids and if they had reached their limit it was home-time! This meant we only spent 3~hours in Magic Kingdom, but it was the first park, they were still adjusting to the heat etc. 

Within a couple days we were doing lots more, kids got on any ride they wanted, they all thoroughly enjoyed it. 

Their favourites were Legoland and Seaworld, and the villa having our own pool was a godsend. 
Rental was a Ford Expedition, can't get them at home so now I'm missing the big suv 😅 

We have munched through our Cheetos, Ruffles & Reeses haul already 🤣

I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them?

998,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, enjoy",Thinking about moving to Florida from Montana.,"Don't get me wrong, Montana is an absolutely gorgeous state with views that don't compare to many other places. However, I was born and raised in Florida, moved out of the state almost a decade ago now and every year I think about moving back but I am afraid of only being drawn back by nostalgia. I was raised in Pasco County, to give you an idea of where I'm from. I had no choice but to move, seeing as I was a minor at the time but now that I am financially stable and have nothing tying me down I've been toying with the idea to move back. I hate the winters, the snow is absolutely awful and just this last week it was -38 here in Montana. I have no love for snow sports, I love the heat and the humidity is something I'm used to. I would much rather do warm activities such as exploring, boating, hiking, and things of that nature. 

The main reason I want to move back to Florida is all my siblings live there with their kids, I am very family oriented and want to be involved in their lives. I know it's gotten far more expensive to live, but I am also moving from a place where a 1bd/1bath costs about 2,000$ a month. Car insurance here is cheap but car registration is not. Food prices are insane, but gas prices are low currently. Not to mention, the harsh conditions of the roads and the snow causes ware and tear on your vehicle. Within two months of living in Montana I had accumulated two cracks in my windshield and I stay far behind others while driving. All this to say, I am not very happy here.  Also Montana is very isolated with their cities, you have to drive at least two hours to get to another 'big' city. I like populated areas, being in the city. Yada yada. 

I've lived in Saint Louis, Detroit, and now a rinky-dink town in Montana so I am no stranger to extremely populated areas with high crime rates, low pay, and extremely populated areas. 

For those of you who were born in Florida, left and then came back, was it something you regretted or were you drawn back and enjoying it?  ",2024-01-18 19:44:01

I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating.

1005,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, enjoy",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

1027,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, dislike",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

I’m just not sure anymore. My husband NEVER wants to leave, and I find sitting through a Cat 5 hurricane inside a boarded up house extremely anxiety producing.

1031,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, dislike",Moved to Miami and here’s my Take. (Warning),"So after living and Moving out of Miami here’s my not so great take on it.
*Low Pay high cost of living/Slave State
(I felt like I worked in an all inclusive)
*Vacation vs Living here is completely different 
(I obviously expected this but it’s really really different.)
*People say the “N” word a lot like overtly
* Driving reminded me of driving in Costa Rica obviously better paved but really reckless.
* A lot of Spanish which was good because I knew a bit and learned a lot.
*Service wise people try to take advantage of you almost all the time.
*The weather is Brutal
(The constant heat, rain, floods, hurricane warnings which they make it seem like the worlds going to end and puts your nerves on edge) Did I mention flood driving… Anxiety on a new level lol
*Mosquitos run in packs and I’ve never been so bit up in my life, keep bug spray on you.
*Top 10 Cockroach infestation in the country
* People weren’t the kindest out here that’s for sure and I was treated super weird going into certain restaurants not knowing Spanish.
*Allergies
(I hardly have allergies but apparently the mold due to the high humidity and pollen was pretty intense)
This seems to be what I was told which it’s a great retirement place.
I recently moved out, went back to where I can pay 1400 for a 1 bedroom, Make more money, save money and visit Miami for a few weeks and head back home to continue saving money for my retirement. Moving there was a whirlwind and if you can make it out there good for you but nothing in the world would make me want to move back unless I hit the lotto and even then I don’t like the hurricanes and flooding so I’d still probably pass and only vacation there. You’ll loose years of your life trying to keep up with bills along with the lifestyle.
Anyways this is my personal experience, I thought I’d share just in case someone was looking into moving there. 
Oh also the employment market is overtly saturated, keep in mind that about 22Million people live in Florida so they can easily find someone to underpay for the position you applied for and they have people lined up for it. Not me, I’d choose financial liberty and low cost of living every time.",2023-12-17 23:25:01

1044,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, dislike",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.
 
I’m curious what you all have to say.",2024-06-12 14:37:32
1064,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, annoying",Moved to Miami and here’s my Take. (Warning),"So after living and Moving out of Miami here’s my not so great take on it.
*Low Pay high cost of living/Slave State
(I felt like I worked in an all inclusive)
*Vacation vs Living here is completely different 
(I obviously expected this but it’s really really different.)
*People say the “N” word a lot like overtly
* Driving reminded me of driving in Costa Rica obviously better paved but really reckless.
* A lot of Spanish which was good because I knew a bit and learned a lot.
*Service wise people try to take advantage of you almost all the time.
*The weather is Brutal
(The constant heat, rain, floods, hurricane warnings which they make it seem like the worlds going to end and puts your nerves on edge) Did I mention flood driving… Anxiety on a new level lol
*Mosquitos run in packs and I’ve never been so bit up in my life, keep bug spray on you.
*Top 10 Cockroach infestation in the country
* People weren’t the kindest out here that’s for sure and I was treated super weird going into certain restaurants not knowing Spanish.
*Allergies
(I hardly have allergies but apparently the mold due to the high humidity and pollen was pretty intense)
This seems to be what I was told which it’s a great retirement place.
I recently moved out, went back to where I can pay 1400 for a 1 bedroom, Make more money, save money and visit Miami for a few weeks and head back home to continue saving money for my retirement. Moving there was a whirlwind and if you can make it out there good for you but nothing in the world would make me want to move back unless I hit the lotto and even then I don’t like the hurricanes and flooding so I’d still probably pass and only vacation there. You’ll loose years of your life trying to keep up with bills along with the lifestyle.
Anyways this is my personal experience, I thought I’d share just in case someone was looking into moving there. 
Oh also the employment market is overtly saturated, keep in mind that about 22Million people live in Florida so they can easily find someone to underpay for the position you applied for and they have people lined up for it. Not me, I’d choose financial liberty and low cost of living every time.",2023-12-17 23:25:01

People do not care if they’ll run you over(they’ll get away with it) it was incredibly frustrating because I liked the workout.i like getting exercise when I can get, and the weather is getting tolerable

I’ve never been shown a greater amount of disrespect by the general public than on a bicycle. Nobody yields, nobody gives space, people will purposely vroom past you, it seriously felt like I was vilified by society like I was some murderer.

No i wasn’t one of those annoying bicyclists that ride in the middle of the road or one that has a chip on their shoulder. I’m 20 years old, riding my bike to the library or a friends house so I can go use the computer to do schoolwork because I can’t do it at home. I always rode on the sidewalk whenever possible but there’s sometimes no sidewalk. And I’ve almost been hit a couple of times. Dead before I can legally drink because I don’t have a car was a wild thought. I will never ever ride a bike on public areas again. I have a car again, and seriously it takes zero effort to let a bicycle cross the fucking street or give them some space. What is wrong with our country?

1078,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, annoying",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

Once I got home and used the medication everything went away quickly. Now I’ve been back for 3 weeks to deal with the hurricanes, and within 2 days of arriving I got the exact same awful reaction. I noticed a few days ago it started getting a lot better since the weather has been quite a bit cooler.

1095,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, happy",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19

1101,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, happy",Moved to Miami and here’s my Take. (Warning),"So after living and Moving out of Miami here’s my not so great take on it.
*Low Pay high cost of living/Slave State
(I felt like I worked in an all inclusive)
*Vacation vs Living here is completely different 
(I obviously expected this but it’s really really different.)
*People say the “N” word a lot like overtly
* Driving reminded me of driving in Costa Rica obviously better paved but really reckless.
* A lot of Spanish which was good because I knew a bit and learned a lot.
*Service wise people try to take advantage of you almost all the time.
*The weather is Brutal
(The constant heat, rain, floods, hurricane warnings which they make it seem like the worlds going to end and puts your nerves on edge) Did I mention flood driving… Anxiety on a new level lol
*Mosquitos run in packs and I’ve never been so bit up in my life, keep bug spray on you.
*Top 10 Cockroach infestation in the country
* People weren’t the kindest out here that’s for sure and I was treated super weird going into certain restaurants not knowing Spanish.
*Allergies
(I hardly have allergies but apparently the mold due to the high humidity and pollen was pretty intense)
This seems to be what I was told which it’s a great retirement place.
I recently moved out, went back to where I can pay 1400 for a 1 bedroom, Make more money, save money and visit Miami for a few weeks and head back home to continue saving money for my retirement. Moving there was a whirlwind and if you can make it out there good for you but nothing in the world would make me want to move back unless I hit the lotto and even then I don’t like the hurricanes and flooding so I’d still probably pass and only vacation there. You’ll loose years of your life trying to keep up with bills along with the lifestyle.
Anyways this is my personal experience, I thought I’d share just in case someone was looking into moving there. 
Oh also the employment market is overtly saturated, keep in mind that about 22Million people live in Florida so they can easily find someone to underpay for the position you applied for and they have people lined up for it. Not me, I’d choose financial liberty and low cost of living every time.",2023-12-17 23:25:01

1107,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, happy",AMA: I am a grower at a native plant nursery.,"Hello, I've been growing for about a year now and am nowhere near an expert. I do have a lot of shareable knowledge, though. I dable into edible and medicinal plants as well. I live in area 10a, and I have a knowledge of 9a-9b, but I am willing to talk about other zones. 

So often, we find ourselves wanting to beautify our yards and give back to what the ""wild"" Florida used to be. However, in a more sustainably ecological way that actually lives through brutal heat, salt water inundation, flooding, or shade!

If you find yourself at local nursery's or Homedepot buying these flowering plants that wilt within a week, need constant expensive fertilizer, or never seem to last long at all; there is a solution. 

We face a heartbreaking amount of no-thought, no-care development that is tearing down ecosystems that are rare, biodiverse, and dwindling by the day.

There is one thing you can do right now and make a larger, more imediate impact on your doorstep. Besides advocating for environmental protections. That is planting true Florida native plants that support an enormous amount of wildlife by making your home a sanctuary for: birds, mammals, insects, reptiles, and amphibians. While it sounds scary, they will rarely come in if you give them a comfy home outside with food. 

The benefits are nearly endless, as true Florida blooms year round, evergreen (sometimes), bloomimg, pollinating, or providing habitat. It holds our sandy, nutrient-poor sediment together and protects it from erosion. You can get rid of your lawn and replace it with flowering groundcovers. You can do wildflowers, shrubs(small, medium, large), host plants, trees (flowering, spiny, statement), and rare plants that are losing habitat. 

I'll include pictures of what I deal with, my yard, creatures, and information. 

Please ask me any questions, I also have plenty of resources🐊

1114,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, happy",Thinking about moving to Florida from Montana.,"Don't get me wrong, Montana is an absolutely gorgeous state with views that don't compare to many other places. However, I was born and raised in Florida, moved out of the state almost a decade ago now and every year I think about moving back but I am afraid of only being drawn back by nostalgia. I was raised in Pasco County, to give you an idea of where I'm from. I had no choice but to move, seeing as I was a minor at the time but now that I am financially stable and have nothing tying me down I've been toying with the idea to move back. I hate the winters, the snow is absolutely awful and just this last week it was -38 here in Montana. I have no love for snow sports, I love the heat and the humidity is something I'm used to. I would much rather do warm activities such as exploring, boating, hiking, and things of that nature. 

The main reason I want to move back to Florida is all my siblings live there with their kids, I am very family oriented and want to be involved in their lives. I know it's gotten far more expensive to live, but I am also moving from a place where a 1bd/1bath costs about 2,000$ a month. Car insurance here is cheap but car registration is not. Food prices are insane, but gas prices are low currently. Not to mention, the harsh conditions of the roads and the snow causes ware and tear on your vehicle. Within two months of living in Montana I had accumulated two cracks in my windshield and I stay far behind others while driving. All this to say, I am not very happy here.  Also Montana is very isolated with their cities, you have to drive at least two hours to get to another 'big' city. I like populated areas, being in the city. Yada yada. 

I've lived in Saint Louis, Detroit, and now a rinky-dink town in Montana so I am no stranger to extremely populated areas with high crime rates, low pay, and extremely populated areas. 

For those of you who were born in Florida, left and then came back, was it something you regretted or were you drawn back and enjoying it?  ",2024-01-18 19:44:01
1115,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, happy",Happy Hurricane Season!,"Hurricane season starts June 1, and this one will be a doozy.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03

1117,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US – all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07

1119,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, happy",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

1123,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‘Dial *FHP for emergency’.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‘soon’.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it’s not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can’t see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‘escorting’ a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‘wide load’ sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm…) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while…. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, “Now that you’ve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?”  The response: “Sir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.” I’ll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy’s awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don’t need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‘fund raiser mode’, but the time I actually need one?

1124,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, happy",New construction - Are insulated windows worth it?,"Trying to decide between insulated and non-insulated impact low-e windows (alum frames) for our new construction home on the west coast of Florida,  We are about a half mile in from the ocean.  The differences are U:0.52/SHGC:0.26 vs U:1.02/SHGC:0.33.

We will have a lot of windows facing due west and due east catching the full morning and afternoon sun.  The difference is around $4k.  I'm willing to spend that if the extra pane/gas insulating layer will help cut down the heat that comes through the window.  The one wall of the master bedroom is 3 large windows due west.  The top floor is one large family, dining and kitchen area with a lot of west and east windows.

I read that the extra layer also helps cut down on sound.

The brand is ES Windows.  I've seen a ton of these being installed in Miami.  I'm curious what percentage of impact windows being installed in FL are also insulated.



My main concerns are:

1) The extra pane on the outside is not impact.  The windows are still rated for hurricanes.  So it seems like if something is going to hit the window, depending on how big/hard the hit is, the outer layer will break 1st and more easily.  I'm told the outer layer can be replaced by itself. They have to remove the part of the frame (not that's attached to the wall) and they replace just the one pane.  i assume they somehow also refill with gas? At this point, the impact layer is really there just to make insurance happy and protect against the really hard hits.

My biggest fear is surviving a hurricane but every outer pane is broke and the cost of fixing them!

2) I'm also reading that for the full insurance discount one, impact alone is not enough, it needs to be impact AND also hurricane shutters since impact windows are so expensive to replace.  I guess if I do install some form of shutter system, then I don't need to worry about the outer pane anymore, but then what was the point of the inner impact layer!

3) Fogging.  I read this a lot.  Seems like it's a defect or broken window?  Would have to roll the dice on if it's covered by warranty?  Our current rental has insulated impact windows and we have the AC set low and no fogging.  But right now, this time of year, due to the orientation, the main windows don't get much sun. I also installed insulated non-impact windows in another fl addition we built 15 yrs ago and no issues with those and that had large due west windows.  Is the fogging really a serious issue or just a very small very loud minority?

I want to do a savage coastal themed one-liner for someone in Florida, but I'm rusty at insulting people, and I don't know coastal insults. 

I would also be happy to do other local-themed insults, like ones relating them to the terrible tourists, but honestly I wouldn't know where to even start. I would really, genuinely, appreciate the help.

Also tbh Floridians kinda intimidate me. I'm fully aware that I do not have the necessary psychological toughness or heat tolerance to survive in Florida. I don't know if my insults would have sufficient kick to really hit home.

The only ones that come to mind so far, I worry they might be too mean?

""You're the type to tear a gash in your hull because you think you're too good for radar or a map.""
 
and

""You'd get caught by a riptide because you'd think everyone was just avoiding the area to give you room for a selfie.""

Most of the water-themed ones that come to my mind are stuff like ""you'd catch a Sunny and think it was a Walleye"" or lake-specific burns, but I don't really know ocean fish that well and lakes and oceans are different.

Please help. They're taking property developer money to change zoning and take down a local racetrack down in Florida, and that's frankly just gross, and I'm ticked off.

Thank you for your help. Whether or not you reply, thank you for reading and I hope you have a really wonderful day. (I actually genuinely mean it.)

1140,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, annoyed",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

1141,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, annoyed",Moved to Miami and here’s my Take. (Warning),"So after living and Moving out of Miami here’s my not so great take on it.
*Low Pay high cost of living/Slave State
(I felt like I worked in an all inclusive)
*Vacation vs Living here is completely different 
(I obviously expected this but it’s really really different.)
*People say the “N” word a lot like overtly
* Driving reminded me of driving in Costa Rica obviously better paved but really reckless.
* A lot of Spanish which was good because I knew a bit and learned a lot.
*Service wise people try to take advantage of you almost all the time.
*The weather is Brutal
(The constant heat, rain, floods, hurricane warnings which they make it seem like the worlds going to end and puts your nerves on edge) Did I mention flood driving… Anxiety on a new level lol
*Mosquitos run in packs and I’ve never been so bit up in my life, keep bug spray on you.
*Top 10 Cockroach infestation in the country
* People weren’t the kindest out here that’s for sure and I was treated super weird going into certain restaurants not knowing Spanish.
*Allergies
(I hardly have allergies but apparently the mold due to the high humidity and pollen was pretty intense)
This seems to be what I was told which it’s a great retirement place.
I recently moved out, went back to where I can pay 1400 for a 1 bedroom, Make more money, save money and visit Miami for a few weeks and head back home to continue saving money for my retirement. Moving there was a whirlwind and if you can make it out there good for you but nothing in the world would make me want to move back unless I hit the lotto and even then I don’t like the hurricanes and flooding so I’d still probably pass and only vacation there. You’ll loose years of your life trying to keep up with bills along with the lifestyle.
Anyways this is my personal experience, I thought I’d share just in case someone was looking into moving there. 
Oh also the employment market is overtly saturated, keep in mind that about 22Million people live in Florida so they can easily find someone to underpay for the position you applied for and they have people lined up for it.

Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

They gave me diagnosis of 4 different skin conditions and half a pharmacy’s worth of creams and ointments.

Once I got home and used the medication everything went away quickly. Now I’ve been back for 3 weeks to deal with the hurricanes, and within 2 days of arriving I got the exact same awful reaction. I noticed a few days ago it started getting a lot better since the weather has been quite a bit cooler.

The heat is only getting hotter, summer after summer, which is the trend.

Hurricanes and storms are getting more catastrophic. Each year is playing Russian roulette in terms of what part of the state is getting ""the big one"". 


I live in a coastal city, which is experiencing more frequent flooding of the streets, especially during King tides, which are worse than ever these last few years. 


Property values and rent are out of control. 


Homeowners insurance is laughable right now. How many insurance companies have stopped doing business in the state? How is this sustainable or affordable long term?


The republican leadership in this state is doing NOTHING about any of the following above and essentially are ignoring the big fat elephant in the state. 


Why would any business or person wish to invest in this state long-term knowing that all of these issues are going to get worse if they're not addressed?


I was thinking about buying an investment property here, but I am not comfortable with it, and am looking out of state now.


What does the future for this state hold? I'm thinking in 20-40 years, this place is borderline inhabitable. At what point do people realize this and try to get out, before it's too late? And they lose all of their property value?",2023-07-21 14:48:17

1176,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, comfortable",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.
 
I’m curious what you all have to say.",2024-06-12 14:37:32
1177,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, comfortable",Moved to Miami and here’s my Take. (Warning),"So after living and Moving out of Miami here’s my not so great take on it.
*Low Pay high cost of living/Slave State
(I felt like I worked in an all inclusive)
*Vacation vs Living here is completely different 
(I obviously expected this but it’s really really different.)
*People say the “N” word a lot like overtly
* Driving reminded me of driving in Costa Rica obviously better paved but really reckless.
* A lot of Spanish which was good because I knew a bit and learned a lot.
*Service wise people try to take advantage of you almost all the time.
*The weather is Brutal
(The constant heat, rain, floods, hurricane warnings which they make it seem like the worlds going to end and puts your nerves on edge) Did I mention flood driving… Anxiety on a new level lol
*Mosquitos run in packs and I’ve never been so bit up in my life, keep bug spray on you.
*Top 10 Cockroach infestation in the country
* People weren’t the kindest out here that’s for sure and I was treated super weird going into certain restaurants not knowing Spanish.
*Allergies
(I hardly have allergies but apparently the mold due to the high humidity and pollen was pretty intense)
This seems to be what I was told which it’s a great retirement place.
I recently moved out, went back to where I can pay 1400 for a 1 bedroom, Make more money, save money and visit Miami for a few weeks and head back home to continue saving money for my retirement. Moving there was a whirlwind and if you can make it out there good for you but nothing in the world would make me want to move back unless I hit the lotto and even then I don’t like the hurricanes and flooding so I’d still probably pass and only vacation there. You’ll loose years of your life trying to keep up with bills along with the lifestyle.
Anyways this is my personal experience, I thought I’d share just in case someone was looking into moving there. 
Oh also the employment market is overtly saturated, keep in mind that about 22Million people live in Florida so they can easily find someone to underpay for the position you applied for and they have people lined up for it.

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60’s?) single pane windows. I’m still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7° temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, “ewww. 80s? You lizard. 🦎“ ... Lol, the room is around 78° and is a completely uninsulated 1970’s porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I’m thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

1191,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, comfortable",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

I swear I developed such a horrible rash/acne all over my body that I even got a biopsy done. They gave me diagnosis of 4 different skin conditions and half a pharmacy’s worth of creams and ointments.

Once I got home and used the medication everything went away quickly. Now I’ve been back for 3 weeks to deal with the hurricanes, and within 2 days of arriving I got the exact same awful reaction. I noticed a few days ago it started getting a lot better since the weather has been quite a bit cooler.

Do people experience this when they come here? Is this florida telling me to stay the fuck out of the state? I looked it up and it seems to be called prickly heat when people come to tropical climates. ",2024-10-17 00:50:52

I've been a Florida resident my whole life but this is my first post here so please be kind 😅. I'm hoping a fellow Floridian familiar with generators/inverters might could help.

So my husband and I live in Crawfordville and, like I'm sure most of you've heard, we're set to have a pretty active hurricane season this year and tbh I'm wanting to get prepared asap-I'm wanting to avoid having to move with our animals.

The issue is that we have a hedgehog and a gecko-both of which require electricity/heat to live comfortably (we also have cats but they're fine without power lol). My immediate thought is to invest in a generator/inverter but I know very little about them. 

At minimum we'd need something that can keep a 24 watt UVB linear bulb, a 25 watt incandescent bulb, and two 150 watt heat emitters running in order for our small animals to be comfortable. I'm not too concerned about the fridge although it would be nice to have something to keep it running too (I can't really find the starting/running watts anywhere in the manual so I'm unsure as to how much power it consumes (it's an old Kenmore from Sears-model #253 74802409)).

Is there anything out there that could give us what we need? I was looking into Jackery power stations but I dont think one would be powerful enough to handle everything-I may just get one to run random small appliances/charge phones. I've been told by both our families that gas powered generators aren't worth the trouble but if that's the case I dont know what else to do 🙃.",2024-05-26 22:40:38

1202,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, comfortable","Golden Magnolia Resort in Flagler Beach, FL - AVOID!","For my wife and my 20th wedding anniversary, I had the bright idea to go back to the bed and breakfast we had stayed at on our honeymoon.  At the time, it was a small, quiet and nice bed and breakfast in Flagler Beach named the White Orchid Inn.  We loved that place.  Since then, it is under new ownership and is now named the Golden Magnolia Resort.  It now sucks and is WAY overpriced.

1. The stairs leading up to the second floor rooms are shaky and you have to use the handrails to not fall.  However, the handrails have broken and chipped paint that hurt your hands and are rusting.  Even the property manager told us she doesn't like going up and down those stairs.

2.  The drain in the hot tub looks like it spent the last 20 years under water on a ship wreck.  It was so rusted, we did not feel comfortable using it.

3.  The swimming pool and the heated mineral pool were filthy.  We actually used the skimmer to try to clean the mineral pool ourselves, but once we got in, we saw all the scum on the tiles and quickly got out.

4.  The towels were stained and had large rips.

5.  The wifi and TV service never worked the entire time we were there.

6.  Our plans changed and we needed to leave a day early.  I talked to the property manager and she said she would change the reservation and refund us what we had paid for the last night of the stay that we wouldn't be using.  We left by 10am that morning so they had plenty of time to clean the room and prepare it for someone else.  It turned out that she lied and never gave us the refund.  When we complained afterwards through Expedia's customer service, they tried contacting the property but could not get approval for the refund so we ended up paying over $300 for a night in a room we didn't use even after being assured that wouldn't happen.

7.  The nice and quiet atmosphere is now ruined by a bar that is directly adjacent to the property.  Our room was on the opposite side of the property but we still could hear the customers and the music through the walls until after 2am each night.

8.  One of the ""features"" they mention is that you are within view of the historical Flagler Beach pier.  They don't mention it was badly damaged in a storm over 2 years ago and has not been repaired and is just boarded up.  The last section of it looks like it will fall into the ocean anytime now.

9.  One of the two mornings we were there, we came down for breakfast and were told that the cook just didn't show up that day so our bed and breakfast had no breakfast but no compensation was offered for this.10.  The waitress was telling us private stuff about other staff members like a cracked skull during a fight with her boyfriend.  That isn't the story you want to hear on your romantic anniversary trip and should have been told to the police instead or out of town customers.

Overall, this place is poorly managed, not maintained and way overpriced for what you are getting.  I highly recommend avoiding it and if you have reservations already, cancel them and then monitor your credit card to make sure they don't charge you anyway.",2024-04-12 13:42:02

I do not care about power outages it is irrelevant. It's back on in a few days or a few hours. Most people fear power outages in Florida due to the extreme temperatures and the inability to find air conditioning in such an occasion. So you are aware the Florida born and raised can wear black sweater and a hoodie outside as I do this everyday. I wore the black hoodie to keep the sunlight off me. Even when I worked outside doing manual labor I kept a sweater on me. At lunch time when you take it off everything feels frigid like you just walked into a 73° house. This all comes from personal experience. If you're not seasoned for heat then you probably shouldn't be in Florida. It takes time for your body to be acclimated to the harsh climate here. What most people would consider suffering humidity we as Floridians don't really even notice it most of the time. Because when you're born in it, that just makes it business as usual. I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone. Democracy dies in the state. Heat makes people only care about what's actually important. So if you're from up North welcome to the Republic.

1215,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, love",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

But I have this fear, it always seems like everybody is talking about leaving Florida, but they never seem to actually do it.  Furthermore, people who do, it often seems like they end up back in short time.  One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.  

So what I am asking here, is there any success stories from former Floridians who moved away and loved it? Or just anybody who can share some experiences?

1221,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, love",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I’m 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami’s airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! 👀 wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I’ve ever been too, and I’ve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I’ve ever experienced; and I’ve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I’m going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I’m heading to Tampa which I’m very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! 😋

Anywho, just wanted to holler and tell you how cool I thought this state was, not being in the touristy Orlando spots. I hope to come down here and go camping in panther country some day. I had no idea panther crossing were a real thing before today?! I’m just blown away with how much there is to do, and eat down here–it’s endless! What a cool f’n place.

We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them.

I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do?

1243,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, love",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

When extreme weather events hit—floods, hurricanes, wildfires—evacuations and rescues become critical, but sometimes, resources and helping hands are limited. We're exploring ideas to strengthen our communities and would love to hear from you.

**The Concept:** Imagine a community where, in times of disaster, those with the means (vehicles, boats, safe spaces) not only ensure their own evacuation but also assist others in need. This support wouldn’t just be voluntary; there would be incentives—things like tax breaks, gift cards, or community points that could be redeemed for local benefits.

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **If you had resources to help during a disaster (like a truck, extra room, etc.), would incentives motivate you to help others evacuate?**
2. **What types of incentives do you think would encourage people in your community to step up in times of crisis?**

1248,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, love",My sisters front yard was struck by lightning,"My sister bought a house in Citrus Hills just before real estate exploded, so a home  built in 2019, and now why they wanted to sell. The house has another neighbor, on dual quarter acre lots and that house has been there fifteen years and has above ground utilities.

When they met the neighbors they happened to mention that their house has been hit by lightning twice. I thought that was remarkable, they are pretty much inland. 

My sis just texted me that lightning hit her front yard. Dirt was tossed against the house and almost  broke a window. Their TVs are fried. And she said it was super crazy loud. I truly would have shit my pants.

So , on half an acre, that is three lightning strikes.

The owner of my company has an RV he’s imploring us to take for a few days to enjoy before he sells it. I’m due for a very relaxing vacation and I’d love to take advantage of the opportunity. I’m in Broward and what I’m looking for is something by some water, preferably with a ton of tree coverage where I can park the RV and set up a couple chairs outside to not bake in direct heat. 

My boss went to a newer RV park by the Keys recently and looking at the pics, it was entirely exposed without any trees aside from the occasional tiny palm between lots. That wasn’t appealing at all to me as they had to spend the entire time IN the RV due to the direct sunlight. 

I’d love to be able to get some snorkeling in but outside of that, I’m not looking for a ton of things to do as I need this vacation to be as chilled out as possible. Ideally I’ll be getting some snorkeling done during the day then sitting by the RV with a guitar for the rest of the night relaxing.

1264,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, hate",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

Nice to see some justice in our country again and helping me look at the better side of things.  I've been so focused on my disgust of DeSantis and the policy makers here, the school board in Sarasota where my children go to school and so on that I've stopped taking time to appreciate some of the special things about Florida that I love.  So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

Im not trying to paint this as a left or right thing, I identify as socially left and economically right, so I am  not taking a side here. but seriously yall need to appreciate what you have that us in other states (CA, NC,SC) dont have at all.

I understand some of yall dont like desantis and dont like his social policy, fair enough (although that new alimony law should have won some of you socially left people over, alimony is a patriarchal construct in the first place)

1278,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.

1279,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06

I’m 37 and I live with my parents. I make 67,000 a year and cannot afford my own place, I SHOULD HATE transplants according to y’all’s, but guess what? I don’t. You know why? Because that’s the name of the game, that’s right.

Florida is essentially developed swampland, sure but Florida has a desirable climate, low taxes, and lots of corporations are moving here. Home prices here have gone up FASTER than the average ever since the invention of home air conditioning, florida has always had more inflow for most of y’all’s lives, for a reason.

I own a cabin in Anchorage AK, I bought it to fish, and avoid paying taxes on a work bonus. I’d kill myself if I had to live there. Believe it or not, but most people don’t like the cold. Most of the land area in the US gets pretty cold(below freezing lows for at least 1/3 of the year) and people are free to spend their money and move wherever they want.

Supply and demand forces are at play, many of us who are not homeowners may never own a home here, it sucks BIG, but that’s how it works. Same shit happened in Hawaii, bulldozed native homes to build ostentatious beachfront homes, LA, San Diego, Phoenix, Arizona, you think you’re special?. That’s just the name of game, jit. That’s how capitalism works. Prices don’t go up because it sucks living here. The brutal winters in NYC sucked asshole. The summer “nights” at the cabin suck asshole.

Every place with a appealing climate is gonna get rocked with not affordable CoL, that’s how it works, that’s how it has worked and it’s how it will always work.

Don’t have a gripe because people want to live in a nicer place, with nicer weather, with nicer tax treatment. That’s petty, makes you look childish.

If you’re dead set on hating someone because you’ll never own a home here, hate Airbnb, OpenDoor, and Zillow, don’t hate people because they see an opportunity to live a better life, fuck that.

Snowbirds though… fuck em(because they don’t contribute to society and drive like crap) but once again, what can you do, they got the money, they’re gonna do what they’re gonna do.",2023-01-15 03:22:03

Basically, I am a graduating engineer in Southern Ontario (near Toronto) and I'm unable to find a job here due to the job market.

Reasons why I want to leave Canada:

1. Terrible housing market (the low end for houses is $1M)
2. High Income Taxes
3. Terrible weather - hate the winter
4. No job opportunities

I'd only be able to move there by getting a TN visa from a work sponsorship.

While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous. 

What happened to Florida? Its literally become the playground for the far right. I dont even associate it with Publix, alligators, oranges, beaches, dolphins and Jimmy Buffett music anymore.",2023-07-03 14:00:21

1287,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, enjoy",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

We are flying to Miami in mid February and just want to have a relaxing time with a 7 year old child and see the southern part of Florida (everglades, keys, miami, jupiter) and if weather permits swim in the ocean and spend time on the beach. We have 11 days total, but I can't pick a city to rent an airbnb in and which to use as a hub. I booked a condo with a pool in Aventura, but I'm reading about the traffic and the fact that there's no ocean access and I'm already hesitant if it’s a good choice.. I didn't want to stay in Miami itself because it's a noisy and pricy  but now I'm not ruling it out.

The owner of my company has an RV he’s imploring us to take for a few days to enjoy before he sells it. I’m due for a very relaxing vacation and I’d love to take advantage of the opportunity. I’m in Broward and what I’m looking for is something by some water, preferably with a ton of tree coverage where I can park the RV and set up a couple chairs outside to not bake in direct heat. 

My boss went to a newer RV park by the Keys recently and looking at the pics, it was entirely exposed without any trees aside from the occasional tiny palm between lots. That wasn’t appealing at all to me as they had to spend the entire time IN the RV due to the direct sunlight. 

I’d love to be able to get some snorkeling in but outside of that, I’m not looking for a ton of things to do as I need this vacation to be as chilled out as possible. Ideally I’ll be getting some snorkeling done during the day then sitting by the RV with a guitar for the rest of the night relaxing.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03
1322,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US – all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‘soon’.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it’s not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can’t see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‘escorting’ a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‘wide load’ sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm…) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while…. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, “Now that you’ve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?”  The response: “Sir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.” I’ll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy’s awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don’t need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‘fund raiser mode’, but the time I actually need one?

People do not care if they’ll run you over(they’ll get away with it) it was incredibly frustrating because I liked the workout.i like getting exercise when I can get, and the weather is getting tolerable

I’ve never been shown a greater amount of disrespect by the general public than on a bicycle. Nobody yields, nobody gives space, people will purposely vroom past you, it seriously felt like I was vilified by society like I was some murderer.

No i wasn’t one of those annoying bicyclists that ride in the middle of the road or one that has a chip on their shoulder. I’m 20 years old, riding my bike to the library or a friends house so I can go use the computer to do schoolwork because I can’t do it at home. I always rode on the sidewalk whenever possible but there’s sometimes no sidewalk. And I’ve almost been hit a couple of times. Dead before I can legally drink because I don’t have a car was a wild thought. I will never ever ride a bike on public areas again. I have a car again, and seriously it takes zero effort to let a bicycle cross the fucking street or give them some space. What is wrong with our country?

1328,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, comfortable",Heat film - effective heat reduction on old windows,"For those of us where replacing windows simply isn’t an option financially, or logistically, or because you’re a renter, just wanted to share a small success story on heat film.

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60’s?) single pane windows. I’m still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7° temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, “ewww. 80s? You lizard. 🦎“ ... Lol, the room is around 78° and is a completely uninsulated 1970’s porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I’m thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

1329,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, comfortable",Florida power outages? we don't care!,"Buckle up this ain't short. I am the Florida born and raised. I do not care about power outages it is irrelevant. It's back on in a few days or a few hours. Most people fear power outages in Florida due to the extreme temperatures and the inability to find air conditioning in such an occasion. So you are aware the Florida born and raised can wear black sweater and a hoodie outside as I do this everyday. I wore the black hoodie to keep the sunlight off me. Even when I worked outside doing manual labor I kept a sweater on me. At lunch time when you take it off everything feels frigid like you just walked into a 73° house. This all comes from personal experience. If you're not seasoned for heat then you probably shouldn't be in Florida. It takes time for your body to be acclimated to the harsh climate here. What most people would consider suffering humidity we as Floridians don't really even notice it most of the time. Because when you're born in it, that just makes it business as usual. I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone. Democracy dies in the state. Heat makes people only care about what's actually important. So if you're from up North welcome to the Republic. Florida welcomes your soon-to-be Republic children.",2023-06-19 16:26:55

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19

We would love to be somewhere away from drunk college kids and screaming children (no kids of our own and I'm a teacher so I need a break from them).  No interest in any theme parks or nightlife.  We love national parks, hiking, wildlife, botanical gardens, maybe a nice seafood dinner or two (but don't mind cooking for ourselves).  I know basically every beach will be crowded at this time, and we'd be willing to deal with that for a couple of beach days as long as it was a more chill vibe.  We thought it'd be cool to try our hand at snorkeling.  A boat ride of some sort would be cool.

Any recommendations for areas to look into?  We'd prefer an airbnb or private home rental (if it had a private pool I'd be in absolute heaven) and will probably rent a car after flying in.

However reading about it it seems like a rainy month and it makes me think it might not be the best time to visit? I have visited once in April (or February or March I can't remember, it was a family trip when I was a kid)  and then the weather was lovely.

Does it rain all day every day with cloudy skies or what does it look like?

We plan on mainly visiting beaches, swimming, reading, enjoying the sun, laying by the pool etc. with maybe some day trips to maybe a botanical garden, maybe disney and such. But mainly the beach. We would also like to go on a Caribbean Cruise for one week.

Please give me some advice! I would really like to go to Florida but maybe it's better to visit some other time of year?

EDIT: Can add that we are thinking about maybe Key West and that we are from Sweden so if it rains where we are from it will usually rain all day long. And 22-25 degrees celsius is warm for us.",2024-01-19 14:28:44

I feel like we are not taking care of Florida. We are changing it into something unenjoyable.

1359,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, love",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

There were so many different kinds of lizards, and colorful birds, different kinds of plants, and you could see dolphins swimming from the beach, granted you could only see then fins but it was awesome.

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

But I have this fear, it always seems like everybody is talking about leaving Florida, but they never seem to actually do it.  Furthermore, people who do, it often seems like they end up back in short time.  One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.

Siesta Key: Known for its ultra-fine white quartz sand and calm waters.

Panama City Beach: A long stretch of sandy shore with warm, clear water and plenty of activities.

1372,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, love",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05
1373,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, love","In memoriam of u/realjd, friend, mod, father, and amazing person.","About a month ago, we lost one of our own, fellow mod and friend u/realjd, long before his time. He leaves behind a wife and young son, and a tremendous hole in the hearts of the countless people who's lives he touched. We wanted to share some thoughts, and allow those users who knew him to do so as well. In no particular order:

u/the_lamou: JD was an amazing human being who truly loved people -- all people, regardless of who they were or if he agreed with them or what their circumstances are. He always, without fail, saw the best in everyone. And he made us want to see the best in everyone, too, because he saw the best in us and was just such a great guy that you didn't want to disappoint him. He really cared. He always had time to help. He always wanted to help. He was the heart and soul of the mod team, and he was taken from us too soon. This sub, redddit as a whole, and the world is a lesser place without him in it.

u/razzertto: Our friend and mod extraordinaire JD, passed away recently after a short illness. To say he was “one of the mods” does so little justice to what he was to all of us on r/florida; he was the glue, the soul, the mensch, the guy that we all relied on. He encouraged the mod team to always find the good in everyone and to assume the best intent. He loved hearing both sides of an argument and always wanted to be fair; he built bridges even when the curmudgeons amongst us were less generous.

JD donated time, effort, talent, and money to make the world better. He was caring and kind; the first person to offer to help and the last person to give up on someone or something. He embodied the idea that no man is an island, and each of us is part of the main.

Offline, JD said yes to life! He was always trying new things and visiting new places. He loved his wife and son with all that he had. He was funny and the first to get in on a good joke or gentle prank. He spent his days doting on his son, gaming with him, and taking him on adventures.

He is deeply missed. The bell will toll for us all someday, but today, it tolls for JD.

u/heathersaur: James was the type of person who loved life. He was a hard person to not like and was persistently, infectiously happy. He loved his family and friends. He loved meeting new people and making new friends every where he went. He loved Florida and all it had to offer and he gave his heart and soul to his communities.

James was a true-blooded Florida Man - t-shirt, shorts, and flip-flops (if required). He loved his little home near the beach, he loved the Lagoon, the rivers, the springs, and all of Florida's beautiful nature. Despite all it's faults, he loved his State of Florida, and dedicated so much of his time and energy to make it a better place for all of us.

He loved his Reddit communities and the bonds he formed from them. He was passionate about ensuring our subreddits were a place for our towns and cities to gather and share information, from the latest Pub Sub sale to Hurricane safety information.

His passing has left a gaping hole on our mod team and in our lives. Our hearts ache for the friend we lost and his beautiful family he left behind.

We know his larger than life personality will live on, through us, through his incredible wife and son, and through our communities.

We will make you proud James.

u/iamdeirdre: ReadJD was an amazing human being. He freely gave his help, time, encouragement, and enthusiasm to his friends, and his community!

JD and I lived on opposite sides of Florida, and every time a hurricane started to roll my way he would offer us a room. When I was overwhelmed by my subreddit, he was one of the awesome Florida mods that came aboard to help me wrangle it back into a decent place.

James was always a voice of reason, when people would send Modmails, he would really try to help people out, he always saw the best in people.

James was warm, and funny. He talked so lovingly about his wife, and especially about his son. One of our last conversations was about him setting up a special Minecraft server for his boy, he was really excited to get to play together.

When I made an attempt at raising money for St. Jude's Children's Hospital by streaming for Extra Life, James donated over $100, despite the fact that I'm a terrible streamer. I almost cried when I saw that.

James and I both were on the Mod Council, he really wanted to make things better for his fellow mods. He also tried to make life better in his home community by volunteering his time to a local politician he believed in.

u/realjd was a lovely human being, and I feel lucky that I got to be his friend for a few years, I wish it could have been longer.

u/RallyX26: I struggle to find the words to describe the loss of JD. As others before me have so eloquently stated, he was an incredible person to know and was such an inspiration to everyone around him. He inspired us all to be better people, not by force or by shame, but by example. He truly saw the good in everyone, he put the needs and betterment of everyone else above himself at all times, and he had a passion for volunteering that made the world a better place. He loved his family, he loved his community, and he loved his God. He was kind, he was loving, and he was selfless. He will be... He is... deeply missed.

Our thoughts go out to his family.

**Note:** This should go without saying but nevertheless it will be said -- this thread is going to be vigilantly monitored. Any disrespect, any threadjacking, any bullshit whatsoever evaluated solely at our judgement will result in a permanent ban and a referral for further action to the admins, many of whom knew JD personally and were quite fond of him.

You know, one of the best things about living in Florida is the warm climate. It’s pretty amazing to enjoy sunshine almost all year round, especially if you’re someone who prefers mild winters. And let’s not forget about the stunning beaches! There’s nothing like having beautiful stretches of sand right at your fingertips for relaxing or engaging in water sports.

Another major perk is that Florida doesn’t have a state income tax, which is a nice way to keep more of your hard-earned money. Plus, the cultural diversity here is fantastic. You can experience a vibrant mix of festivals, cuisines, and traditions from all over the world.

If you love the outdoors, you’re in for a treat! There are endless opportunities for hiking, fishing, boating, and golfing. And the natural beauty? Wow! Florida is home to unique ecosystems, including the breathtaking Everglades, and the wildlife is truly something to behold.

Let’s not forget about the world-class attractions, like Walt Disney World and Universal Studios, which provide endless entertainment for people of all ages. Lastly, if you’re thinking about retirement, Florida has a ton of active retirement communities that cater to those looking for a lively lifestyle in a warm setting. 

Sure, there’s a lot to bitch about. 

All in all, it’s a pretty appealing place to call home!",2024-10-06 12:29:11

1386,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, love",Thinking about moving to Florida from Montana.,"Don't get me wrong, Montana is an absolutely gorgeous state with views that don't compare to many other places. However, I was born and raised in Florida, moved out of the state almost a decade ago now and every year I think about moving back but I am afraid of only being drawn back by nostalgia. I was raised in Pasco County, to give you an idea of where I'm from. I had no choice but to move, seeing as I was a minor at the time but now that I am financially stable and have nothing tying me down I've been toying with the idea to move back. I hate the winters, the snow is absolutely awful and just this last week it was -38 here in Montana. I have no love for snow sports, I love the heat and the humidity is something I'm used to. I would much rather do warm activities such as exploring, boating, hiking, and things of that nature. 

The main reason I want to move back to Florida is all my siblings live there with their kids, I am very family oriented and want to be involved in their lives. I know it's gotten far more expensive to live, but I am also moving from a place where a 1bd/1bath costs about 2,000$ a month. Car insurance here is cheap but car registration is not. Food prices are insane, but gas prices are low currently. Not to mention, the harsh conditions of the roads and the snow causes ware and tear on your vehicle. Within two months of living in Montana I had accumulated two cracks in my windshield and I stay far behind others while driving. All this to say, I am not very happy here.  Also Montana is very isolated with their cities, you have to drive at least two hours to get to another 'big' city. I like populated areas, being in the city. Yada yada. 

I've lived in Saint Louis, Detroit, and now a rinky-dink town in Montana so I am no stranger to extremely populated areas with high crime rates, low pay, and extremely populated areas.

1388,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, love",Just did a great work trip through Florida! What a cool state.,"Hello Floridians of Reddit!

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I’m 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami’s airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! 👀 wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I’ve ever been too, and I’ve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I’ve ever experienced; and I’ve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I’m going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I’m heading to Tampa which I’m very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! 😋

Anywho, just wanted to holler and tell you how cool I thought this state was, not being in the touristy Orlando spots. I hope to come down here and go camping in panther country some day. I had no idea panther crossing were a real thing before today?! I’m just blown away with how much there is to do, and eat down here–it’s endless! What a cool f’n place.

When I visited my sister in October, I liked how it felt like vacation…but was kind of uncomfortable. The humidity was insane, my allergies were on max, and I was itchy as soon as I walked out the door. 

My sister is trying to convince me to move down to Orlando where she lives, but she makes nearly 6 figures in a remote position in a company based in NYC. I don’t make that much money. She’s trying to sell me a dream and tells me I’m “scared” and overthinking when I think I’m being cautious lol. I also have to consider expenses. 

My other options are Northern Virginia, DC, PA, NJ. 

I was looking through the sub and instead of asking about pros and cons, tell me why you’re leaving. I’d love to hear from those of you who moved from the Northeast and are leaving the state. 

Mostly so that I can give my sister actual reasons she can’t argue about because she can’t take “no” as an answer.

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19

But I find it entertaining whenever I visit. I live in CT where it’s great and safe but so uneventful it gets boring/depressing, especially since it’s cold from Oct-April. So whenever I visit FL (Tampa Bay and Miami) I feel “alive”. From what I’ve seen is just a normal state where people live normal lives, nothing out of this world. I’m sure it’s different when you live there. Besides the weather, what’s so bad about it?

1402,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, hate",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

Nice to see some justice in our country again and helping me look at the better side of things.  I've been so focused on my disgust of DeSantis and the policy makers here, the school board in Sarasota where my children go to school and so on that I've stopped taking time to appreciate some of the special things about Florida that I love.  So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

1415,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, hate",Thinking about moving to Florida from Montana.,"Don't get me wrong, Montana is an absolutely gorgeous state with views that don't compare to many other places. However, I was born and raised in Florida, moved out of the state almost a decade ago now and every year I think about moving back but I am afraid of only being drawn back by nostalgia. I was raised in Pasco County, to give you an idea of where I'm from. I had no choice but to move, seeing as I was a minor at the time but now that I am financially stable and have nothing tying me down I've been toying with the idea to move back. I hate the winters, the snow is absolutely awful and just this last week it was -38 here in Montana. I have no love for snow sports, I love the heat and the humidity is something I'm used to. I would much rather do warm activities such as exploring, boating, hiking, and things of that nature. 

The main reason I want to move back to Florida is all my siblings live there with their kids, I am very family oriented and want to be involved in their lives. I know it's gotten far more expensive to live, but I am also moving from a place where a 1bd/1bath costs about 2,000$ a month. Car insurance here is cheap but car registration is not. Food prices are insane, but gas prices are low currently. Not to mention, the harsh conditions of the roads and the snow causes ware and tear on your vehicle. Within two months of living in Montana I had accumulated two cracks in my windshield and I stay far behind others while driving. All this to say, I am not very happy here.  Also Montana is very isolated with their cities, you have to drive at least two hours to get to another 'big' city. I like populated areas, being in the city. Yada yada. 

I've lived in Saint Louis, Detroit, and now a rinky-dink town in Montana so I am no stranger to extremely populated areas with high crime rates, low pay, and extremely populated areas.

1423,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

1428,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06

I’m 37 and I live with my parents. I make 67,000 a year and cannot afford my own place, I SHOULD HATE transplants according to y’all’s, but guess what? I don’t. You know why? Because that’s the name of the game, that’s right.

Florida is essentially developed swampland, sure but Florida has a desirable climate, low taxes, and lots of corporations are moving here. Home prices here have gone up FASTER than the average ever since the invention of home air conditioning, florida has always had more inflow for most of y’all’s lives, for a reason.

I own a cabin in Anchorage AK, I bought it to fish, and avoid paying taxes on a work bonus. I’d kill myself if I had to live there. Believe it or not, but most people don’t like the cold. Most of the land area in the US gets pretty cold(below freezing lows for at least 1/3 of the year) and people are free to spend their money and move wherever they want.

Supply and demand forces are at play, many of us who are not homeowners may never own a home here, it sucks BIG, but that’s how it works. Same shit happened in Hawaii, bulldozed native homes to build ostentatious beachfront homes, LA, San Diego, Phoenix, Arizona, you think you’re special?. That’s just the name of game, jit. That’s how capitalism works. Prices don’t go up because it sucks living here. The brutal winters in NYC sucked asshole. The summer “nights” at the cabin suck asshole.

Every place with a appealing climate is gonna get rocked with not affordable CoL, that’s how it works, that’s how it has worked and it’s how it will always work.

Don’t have a gripe because people want to live in a nicer place, with nicer weather, with nicer tax treatment. That’s petty, makes you look childish.

If you’re dead set on hating someone because you’ll never own a home here, hate Airbnb, OpenDoor, and Zillow, don’t hate people because they see an opportunity to live a better life, fuck that.

Snowbirds though… fuck em(because they don’t contribute to society and drive like crap) but once again, what can you do, they got the money, they’re gonna do what they’re gonna do.",2023-01-15 03:22:03

I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous.

1463,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, enjoy",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.
 
I’m curious what you all have to say.",2024-06-12 14:37:32

1469,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, enjoy",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

You know, one of the best things about living in Florida is the warm climate. It’s pretty amazing to enjoy sunshine almost all year round, especially if you’re someone who prefers mild winters. And let’s not forget about the stunning beaches! There’s nothing like having beautiful stretches of sand right at your fingertips for relaxing or engaging in water sports.

Another major perk is that Florida doesn’t have a state income tax, which is a nice way to keep more of your hard-earned money. Plus, the cultural diversity here is fantastic. You can experience a vibrant mix of festivals, cuisines, and traditions from all over the world.

If you love the outdoors, you’re in for a treat! There are endless opportunities for hiking, fishing, boating, and golfing. And the natural beauty? Wow! Florida is home to unique ecosystems, including the breathtaking Everglades, and the wildlife is truly something to behold.

Let’s not forget about the world-class attractions, like Walt Disney World and Universal Studios, which provide endless entertainment for people of all ages. Lastly, if you’re thinking about retirement, Florida has a ton of active retirement communities that cater to those looking for a lively lifestyle in a warm setting. 

Sure, there’s a lot to bitch about. 

All in all, it’s a pretty appealing place to call home!",2024-10-06 12:29:11

Generally 2ac or more lots are available in outskirts of these cities. we like more of the rural communities and we might be Ok with this. Do we need to worry about security concerns in outskirts?

I would much rather do warm activities such as exploring, boating, hiking, and things of that nature. 

The main reason I want to move back to Florida is all my siblings live there with their kids, I am very family oriented and want to be involved in their lives. I know it's gotten far more expensive to live, but I am also moving from a place where a 1bd/1bath costs about 2,000$ a month. Car insurance here is cheap but car registration is not. Food prices are insane, but gas prices are low currently. Not to mention, the harsh conditions of the roads and the snow causes ware and tear on your vehicle. Within two months of living in Montana I had accumulated two cracks in my windshield and I stay far behind others while driving. All this to say, I am not very happy here.  Also Montana is very isolated with their cities, you have to drive at least two hours to get to another 'big' city. I like populated areas, being in the city. Yada yada. 

I've lived in Saint Louis, Detroit, and now a rinky-dink town in Montana so I am no stranger to extremely populated areas with high crime rates, low pay, and extremely populated areas. 

For those of you who were born in Florida, left and then came back, was it something you regretted or were you drawn back and enjoying it?  ",2024-01-18 19:44:01

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating. I'd be giving up everything I love, even down to the food, weather, and geography.

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

1516,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, dislike",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table.

My question is mainly about the weather... Which area will have the most reliable weather for mid-November, and will also have reasonable prices for stay and activities?

FWIW, we'll be coming from Missouri and will be driving.",2024-07-04 13:54:52

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table.

1588,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, happy",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.
 
I’m curious what you all have to say.",2024-06-12 14:37:32

1594,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, happy","In memoriam of u/realjd, friend, mod, father, and amazing person.","About a month ago, we lost one of our own, fellow mod and friend u/realjd, long before his time. He leaves behind a wife and young son, and a tremendous hole in the hearts of the countless people who's lives he touched. We wanted to share some thoughts, and allow those users who knew him to do so as well. In no particular order:

u/the_lamou: JD was an amazing human being who truly loved people -- all people, regardless of who they were or if he agreed with them or what their circumstances are. He always, without fail, saw the best in everyone. And he made us want to see the best in everyone, too, because he saw the best in us and was just such a great guy that you didn't want to disappoint him. He really cared. He always had time to help. He always wanted to help. He was the heart and soul of the mod team, and he was taken from us too soon. This sub, redddit as a whole, and the world is a lesser place without him in it.

u/razzertto: Our friend and mod extraordinaire JD, passed away recently after a short illness. To say he was “one of the mods” does so little justice to what he was to all of us on r/florida; he was the glue, the soul, the mensch, the guy that we all relied on. He encouraged the mod team to always find the good in everyone and to assume the best intent. He loved hearing both sides of an argument and always wanted to be fair; he built bridges even when the curmudgeons amongst us were less generous.

JD donated time, effort, talent, and money to make the world better. He was caring and kind; the first person to offer to help and the last person to give up on someone or something. He embodied the idea that no man is an island, and each of us is part of the main.

Offline, JD said yes to life! He was always trying new things and visiting new places. He loved his wife and son with all that he had. He was funny and the first to get in on a good joke or gentle prank. He spent his days doting on his son, gaming with him, and taking him on adventures.

He is deeply missed. The bell will toll for us all someday, but today, it tolls for JD.

u/heathersaur: James was the type of person who loved life. He was a hard person to not like and was persistently, infectiously happy. He loved his family and friends. He loved meeting new people and making new friends every where he went. He loved Florida and all it had to offer and he gave his heart and soul to his communities.

James was a true-blooded Florida Man - t-shirt, shorts, and flip-flops (if required). He loved his little home near the beach, he loved the Lagoon, the rivers, the springs, and all of Florida's beautiful nature. Despite all it's faults, he loved his State of Florida, and dedicated so much of his time and energy to make it a better place for all of us.

He loved his Reddit communities and the bonds he formed from them. He was passionate about ensuring our subreddits were a place for our towns and cities to gather and share information, from the latest Pub Sub sale to Hurricane safety information.

His passing has left a gaping hole on our mod team and in our lives. Our hearts ache for the friend we lost and his beautiful family he left behind.

We know his larger than life personality will live on, through us, through his incredible wife and son, and through our communities.

We will make you proud James.

u/iamdeirdre: ReadJD was an amazing human being. He freely gave his help, time, encouragement, and enthusiasm to his friends, and his community!

JD and I lived on opposite sides of Florida, and every time a hurricane started to roll my way he would offer us a room. When I was overwhelmed by my subreddit, he was one of the awesome Florida mods that came aboard to help me wrangle it back into a decent place.

James was always a voice of reason, when people would send Modmails, he would really try to help people out, he always saw the best in people.

James was warm, and funny. He talked so lovingly about his wife, and especially about his son. One of our last conversations was about him setting up a special Minecraft server for his boy, he was really excited to get to play together.

When I made an attempt at raising money for St. Jude's Children's Hospital by streaming for Extra Life, James donated over $100, despite the fact that I'm a terrible streamer. I almost cried when I saw that.

James and I both were on the Mod Council, he really wanted to make things better for his fellow mods. He also tried to make life better in his home community by volunteering his time to a local politician he believed in.

u/realjd was a lovely human being, and I feel lucky that I got to be his friend for a few years, I wish it could have been longer.

u/RallyX26: I struggle to find the words to describe the loss of JD. As others before me have so eloquently stated, he was an incredible person to know and was such an inspiration to everyone around him. He inspired us all to be better people, not by force or by shame, but by example. He truly saw the good in everyone, he put the needs and betterment of everyone else above himself at all times, and he had a passion for volunteering that made the world a better place. He loved his family, he loved his community, and he loved his God. He was kind, he was loving, and he was selfless. He will be... He is... deeply missed.

Our thoughts go out to his family.

**Note:** This should go without saying but nevertheless it will be said -- this thread is going to be vigilantly monitored. Any disrespect, any threadjacking, any bullshit whatsoever evaluated solely at our judgement will result in a permanent ban and a referral for further action to the admins, many of whom knew JD personally and were quite fond of him.

My husband and I are planning to go somewhere for my spring break - end of March.  I know this is prime spring breaker time.  We would love to be somewhere away from drunk college kids and screaming children (no kids of our own and I'm a teacher so I need a break from them).  No interest in any theme parks or nightlife.  We love national parks, hiking, wildlife, botanical gardens, maybe a nice seafood dinner or two (but don't mind cooking for ourselves).  I know basically every beach will be crowded at this time, and we'd be willing to deal with that for a couple of beach days as long as it was a more chill vibe.  We thought it'd be cool to try our hand at snorkeling.  A boat ride of some sort would be cool.

1599,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, happy",Thinking about moving to Florida from Montana.,"Don't get me wrong, Montana is an absolutely gorgeous state with views that don't compare to many other places. However, I was born and raised in Florida, moved out of the state almost a decade ago now and every year I think about moving back but I am afraid of only being drawn back by nostalgia. I was raised in Pasco County, to give you an idea of where I'm from. I had no choice but to move, seeing as I was a minor at the time but now that I am financially stable and have nothing tying me down I've been toying with the idea to move back. I hate the winters, the snow is absolutely awful and just this last week it was -38 here in Montana. I have no love for snow sports, I love the heat and the humidity is something I'm used to. I would much rather do warm activities such as exploring, boating, hiking, and things of that nature. 

The main reason I want to move back to Florida is all my siblings live there with their kids, I am very family oriented and want to be involved in their lives. I know it's gotten far more expensive to live, but I am also moving from a place where a 1bd/1bath costs about 2,000$ a month. Car insurance here is cheap but car registration is not. Food prices are insane, but gas prices are low currently. Not to mention, the harsh conditions of the roads and the snow causes ware and tear on your vehicle. Within two months of living in Montana I had accumulated two cracks in my windshield and I stay far behind others while driving. All this to say, I am not very happy here.  Also Montana is very isolated with their cities, you have to drive at least two hours to get to another 'big' city. I like populated areas, being in the city. Yada yada. 

I've lived in Saint Louis, Detroit, and now a rinky-dink town in Montana so I am no stranger to extremely populated areas with high crime rates, low pay, and extremely populated areas. 

For those of you who were born in Florida, left and then came back, was it something you regretted or were you drawn back and enjoying it?  ",2024-01-18 19:44:01

1601,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, happy",Happy Hurricane Season!,"Hurricane season starts June 1, and this one will be a doozy.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03
1602,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US – all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07

1610,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‘Dial *FHP for emergency’.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‘soon’.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it’s not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can’t see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‘escorting’ a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‘wide load’ sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm…) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while…. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, “Now that you’ve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?”  The response: “Sir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.” I’ll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy’s awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don’t need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‘fund raiser mode’, but the time I actually need one?

BTW- the inside of a lighting bolt is bright yellow.",2023-08-06 19:47:46

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing.

I’ve never been shown a greater amount of disrespect by the general public than on a bicycle. Nobody yields, nobody gives space, people will purposely vroom past you, it seriously felt like I was vilified by society like I was some murderer.

No i wasn’t one of those annoying bicyclists that ride in the middle of the road or one that has a chip on their shoulder. I’m 20 years old, riding my bike to the library or a friends house so I can go use the computer to do schoolwork because I can’t do it at home. I always rode on the sidewalk whenever possible but there’s sometimes no sidewalk. And I’ve almost been hit a couple of times. Dead before I can legally drink because I don’t have a car was a wild thought. I will never ever ride a bike on public areas again. I have a car again, and seriously it takes zero effort to let a bicycle cross the fucking street or give them some space. What is wrong with our country?

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19

1703,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, love",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.
 
I’m curious what you all have to say.",2024-06-12 14:37:32

I want to go to the beach but the water there isn't even refreshing because it's so hot. It's also very crowded.

I love that I live in a place where I can get on my bike and ride somewhere. But I struggle to take advantage of this in the summer. There is so much planning I need to do in order to not die from the heat. And then I can only be out for so long in the sun before I feel sick.

A lot of times I end up staying inside all day, paralyzed by trying to make the decision to go out while also trying to plan for all that would entail. A lot of the things I would prefer to do indoors tend to be out of budget for me - things like going to the movies or out to eat or shopping at the mall. I end up feeling guilty because I should be grateful that I get to live in this great state but am not taking advantage of all it has to offer during these months.

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing.

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

But I have this fear, it always seems like everybody is talking about leaving Florida, but they never seem to actually do it.  Furthermore, people who do, it often seems like they end up back in short time.  One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.  

So what I am asking here, is there any success stories from former Floridians who moved away and loved it? Or just anybody who can share some experiences?

1722,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, love",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

My grandparents were born here, so I am not a native native ofc, but I’ve grown up here all my life, and I cannot imagine my life without the sunshine. I always dreamed of raising my kids here and taking them to all of the science centers, nature trails and beaches I love. Ik all the spots as a local.

My current plan is to go to PT school. I have scholarships to finish my BA at FAU honors for neuroscience and I’ll be graduating without debt which is a blessing. Once I graduate pt school, get some experience I’ll take the highest travel contracts and save. I would love to make a difference in FL healthcare. We need it so bad down here, but all healthcare workers are burning out. There are a lot of older people down here, so the rehab demand is good, but I hope I don’t get stuck working at a PT mill, where you can’t focus on individual patient care. 

Thoughts/advice?

There are currently 5 condo complexes being built within just a  3 mile square radius of me, and everything has become so expensive with demand to move here. In Martin county it’s no where near as developed as more southern coastal cities, however we are on route to leveling up with west palm and Boca. 
It’s going to be so packed and I feel our environment will suffer much more in the future. I’m not even against new housing being built! However, they should be making homes for people to buy capital, raise their families, and pass on generational wealth. We should not be living on top of one another.

You know, one of the best things about living in Florida is the warm climate. It’s pretty amazing to enjoy sunshine almost all year round, especially if you’re someone who prefers mild winters. And let’s not forget about the stunning beaches! There’s nothing like having beautiful stretches of sand right at your fingertips for relaxing or engaging in water sports.

Another major perk is that Florida doesn’t have a state income tax, which is a nice way to keep more of your hard-earned money. Plus, the cultural diversity here is fantastic. You can experience a vibrant mix of festivals, cuisines, and traditions from all over the world.

If you love the outdoors, you’re in for a treat! There are endless opportunities for hiking, fishing, boating, and golfing. And the natural beauty? Wow! Florida is home to unique ecosystems, including the breathtaking Everglades, and the wildlife is truly something to behold.

Let’s not forget about the world-class attractions, like Walt Disney World and Universal Studios, which provide endless entertainment for people of all ages. Lastly, if you’re thinking about retirement, Florida has a ton of active retirement communities that cater to those looking for a lively lifestyle in a warm setting.

1738,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, love",Just did a great work trip through Florida! What a cool state.,"Hello Floridians of Reddit!

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I’m 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami’s airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! 👀 wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I’ve ever been too, and I’ve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I’ve ever experienced; and I’ve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I’m going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I’m heading to Tampa which I’m very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! 😋

Anywho, just wanted to holler and tell you how cool I thought this state was, not being in the touristy Orlando spots. I hope to come down here and go camping in panther country some day. I had no idea panther crossing were a real thing before today?! I’m just blown away with how much there is to do, and eat down here–it’s endless! What a cool f’n place.

I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.

1747,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, love",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

1751,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, love",Please Help Us Understand How Communities Respond to Disasters!,"Hi Reddit! 👋 We're participating in a hackathon focused on improving community resilience during natural disasters, and we need your insights! When extreme weather events hit—floods, hurricanes, wildfires—evacuations and rescues become critical, but sometimes, resources and helping hands are limited. We're exploring ideas to strengthen our communities and would love to hear from you.

**The Concept:** Imagine a community where, in times of disaster, those with the means (vehicles, boats, safe spaces) not only ensure their own evacuation but also assist others in need. This support wouldn’t just be voluntary; there would be incentives—things like tax breaks, gift cards, or community points that could be redeemed for local benefits.

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **If you had resources to help during a disaster (like a truck, extra room, etc.), would incentives motivate you to help others evacuate?**
2. **What types of incentives do you think would encourage people in your community to step up in times of crisis?**
3. **What barriers would prevent you from helping others in a disaster situation?**
4. **What’s one thing you think your community could do better to be prepared for an emergency?**

Your feedback could help shape a new solution that empowers communities to be more resilient in the face of climate challenges. If you have personal stories, ideas, or thoughts on the incentives system, please drop a comment below!

1753,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, love","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings.

1755,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, hate",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.
 
I’m curious what you all have to say.",2024-06-12 14:37:32

1757,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes.

This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade...

Nice to see some justice in our country again and helping me look at the better side of things.  I've been so focused on my disgust of DeSantis and the policy makers here, the school board in Sarasota where my children go to school and so on that I've stopped taking time to appreciate some of the special things about Florida that I love.  So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

I understand some of yall dont like desantis and dont like his social policy, fair enough (although that new alimony law should have won some of you socially left people over, alimony is a patriarchal construct in the first place)

1775,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

Personally,  I love Florida. Albeit it I'm from totally different state more northern.  The weather is perfect. The temperature is great,  people are nice,  nothing is ""forced"" politics,  or religion. I'm enjoying a lot of the perks here. Housing is decent,  untilies aren't outrageous.

Florida is essentially developed swampland, sure but Florida has a desirable climate, low taxes, and lots of corporations are moving here. Home prices here have gone up FASTER than the average ever since the invention of home air conditioning, florida has always had more inflow for most of y’all’s lives, for a reason.

I own a cabin in Anchorage AK, I bought it to fish, and avoid paying taxes on a work bonus. I’d kill myself if I had to live there. Believe it or not, but most people don’t like the cold. Most of the land area in the US gets pretty cold(below freezing lows for at least 1/3 of the year) and people are free to spend their money and move wherever they want.

Supply and demand forces are at play, many of us who are not homeowners may never own a home here, it sucks BIG, but that’s how it works. Same shit happened in Hawaii, bulldozed native homes to build ostentatious beachfront homes, LA, San Diego, Phoenix, Arizona, you think you’re special?. That’s just the name of game, jit. That’s how capitalism works. Prices don’t go up because it sucks living here. The brutal winters in NYC sucked asshole. The summer “nights” at the cabin suck asshole.

Every place with a appealing climate is gonna get rocked with not affordable CoL, that’s how it works, that’s how it has worked and it’s how it will always work.

Don’t have a gripe because people want to live in a nicer place, with nicer weather, with nicer tax treatment. That’s petty, makes you look childish.

If you’re dead set on hating someone because you’ll never own a home here, hate Airbnb, OpenDoor, and Zillow, don’t hate people because they see an opportunity to live a better life, fuck that.

Snowbirds though… fuck em(because they don’t contribute to society and drive like crap) but once again, what can you do, they got the money, they’re gonna do what they’re gonna do.",2023-01-15 03:22:03

1785,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, enjoy",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

I want to go to the beach but the water there isn't even refreshing because it's so hot. It's also very crowded.

I love that I live in a place where I can get on my bike and ride somewhere. But I struggle to take advantage of this in the summer. There is so much planning I need to do in order to not die from the heat. And then I can only be out for so long in the sun before I feel sick.

A lot of times I end up staying inside all day, paralyzed by trying to make the decision to go out while also trying to plan for all that would entail. A lot of the things I would prefer to do indoors tend to be out of budget for me - things like going to the movies or out to eat or shopping at the mall.

1787,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, enjoy",What has happened to Florida?,"I grew up in FL and moved away when I was 20. While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous.

I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

You know, one of the best things about living in Florida is the warm climate. It’s pretty amazing to enjoy sunshine almost all year round, especially if you’re someone who prefers mild winters. And let’s not forget about the stunning beaches! There’s nothing like having beautiful stretches of sand right at your fingertips for relaxing or engaging in water sports.

Another major perk is that Florida doesn’t have a state income tax, which is a nice way to keep more of your hard-earned money. Plus, the cultural diversity here is fantastic. You can experience a vibrant mix of festivals, cuisines, and traditions from all over the world.

If you love the outdoors, you’re in for a treat! There are endless opportunities for hiking, fishing, boating, and golfing. And the natural beauty? Wow! Florida is home to unique ecosystems, including the breathtaking Everglades, and the wildlife is truly something to behold.

Let’s not forget about the world-class attractions, like Walt Disney World and Universal Studios, which provide endless entertainment for people of all ages. Lastly, if you’re thinking about retirement, Florida has a ton of active retirement communities that cater to those looking for a lively lifestyle in a warm setting. 

Sure, there’s a lot to bitch about.

The problem is we don't know too much about good and bad areas in Florida and we would prefer to have others who live in Florida give the pros and cons of the state etc about housing costs, insurance costs, and everything else about Florida.

Also my wife and I both enjoy outdoors more, loves gardening. I really hate the cold weather and trying to see if I should move to southern state. my son is junior this year so my goal is to move after his highschool, just to avoid any disturbance during his school.

I am considering the south of Georgia or north of Florida like Jacksonville, Gainesville, Ocala and may be Orlando too. We are not big fan of beach so definitely not considering any coastal areas.

We are in early 40s and considering buying a land (may be 2-4 ac lot) and get it constructed and use most of the portion in gardening and growing our own food.

Generally 2ac or more lots are available in outskirts of these cities. we like more of the rural communities and we might be Ok with this. Do we need to worry about security concerns in outskirts? 

Any suggestions to iron out the plans?",2023-11-20 15:20:14

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating. I'd be giving up everything I love, even down to the food, weather, and geography.

1806,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, enjoy","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

1828,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, dislike",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec.

1833,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, dislike","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06

1839,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, annoying",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

I’ve never been shown a greater amount of disrespect by the general public than on a bicycle. Nobody yields, nobody gives space, people will purposely vroom past you, it seriously felt like I was vilified by society like I was some murderer.

No i wasn’t one of those annoying bicyclists that ride in the middle of the road or one that has a chip on their shoulder.

I always rode on the sidewalk whenever possible but there’s sometimes no sidewalk. And I’ve almost been hit a couple of times. Dead before I can legally drink because I don’t have a car was a wild thought. I will never ever ride a bike on public areas again.

1854,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, happy",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

1864,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, happy",Happy Hurricane Season!,"Hurricane season starts June 1, and this one will be a doozy.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03

1866,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US – all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07

1868,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, happy","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06

1870,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‘Dial *FHP for emergency’.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‘soon’.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it’s not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can’t see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‘escorting’ a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‘wide load’ sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm…) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while…. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, “Now that you’ve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?”  The response: “Sir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.” I’ll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy’s awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don’t need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‘fund raiser mode’, but the time I actually need one?

Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.
 
I’m curious what you all have to say.",2024-06-12 14:37:32

People do not care if they’ll run you over(they’ll get away with it) it was incredibly frustrating because I liked the workout.i like getting exercise when I can get, and the weather is getting tolerable

I’ve never been shown a greater amount of disrespect by the general public than on a bicycle. Nobody yields, nobody gives space, people will purposely vroom past you, it seriously felt like I was vilified by society like I was some murderer.

No i wasn’t one of those annoying bicyclists that ride in the middle of the road or one that has a chip on their shoulder. I’m 20 years old, riding my bike to the library or a friends house so I can go use the computer to do schoolwork because I can’t do it at home. I always rode on the sidewalk whenever possible but there’s sometimes no sidewalk. And I’ve almost been hit a couple of times. Dead before I can legally drink because I don’t have a car was a wild thought. I will never ever ride a bike on public areas again. I have a car again, and seriously it takes zero effort to let a bicycle cross the fucking street or give them some space. What is wrong with our country?

1883,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, annoyed","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings.

At the same time we're constantly stressed and the traffic is outrageous not to mention the infrastructure that's not keeping up with the population and awful urban planning of the area. 

With all of this said: what are some better areas? How is Citrus Springs or Inverness? We find newer homes that are in our price range.

Bradenton while close to the beach, is extremely overcrowded and the people are extremely hostile on the roads. I need the sunshine and the warm weather for mental health reasons and my wife needs peace. She's a teacher here and we're trying to figure out better options for a better quality of life. We've visited Dunellon and Ocala area and while it's not near the beautiful gulf beaches, there's peace up there. I personally like North Port but prices are going up there. Our mortgage is under $1,000 and I really don't want to give that up... At the same time we're constantly stressed and the traffic is outrageous not to mention the infrastructure that's not keeping up with the population and awful urban planning of the area. 

With all of this said: what are some better areas? How is Citrus Springs or Inverness? We find newer homes that are in our price range. The house I own now we've done a lot to though not completely done, we have some good equity in. The mortgage will still be significantly more but less would have to be done hopefully on the next house.  Where are good areas that aren't so crazy?",2024-02-13 18:34:34

Our home and car insurance as well as our taxes have jumped considerably.  Outrageously. One we could handle, two would be OK but all three jumping are making us consider if this is sustainable long term. 

The money we make is just barely maintaining our extravagant lifestyle of 3 meals a day (only slightly sarcastic here) there is no/little getting ahead. Especially considering the need for home upkeep and repairs.

The manatees in the springs. The alligators so old and so perfect that evolution found no need to change them in 8 million years. The ocean and all its fruit. The sunny winters and thunderstorms in the summer. The cypress trees towering above the swamps and tanned rivers.

1902,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunny, love",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

I could use some advice, especially if you are a roofing contractor or work in energy auditing but all are welcome.

I live in central Florida, where there's obviously a lot of hot sunny days. But I also live in a neighborhood where there are a lot of trees, my property has 11 in or around it. At all times at least a 1/3 of my house is under tree shade. My house is gabled if that is relevant, but the common area is vaulted.

I am having my house reroofed in two months. When I had the guy out for a quote I asked him if he had light coloured or cool roof options. He said yes, they use Owens Corning and these have reflective granules that help though he was very insistent to let me know they are not actually energy star. He said they used to be but no longer have that, so not sure if they changed the shingles or if the requirements for getting that changed and they just lost the certificate. I digress, He insisted that the colour I chose wouldn't effect it as much as I think, especially because he noted the ventilation currently is just two vents, and they will be adding shingle over ridge vents. He also suggested dark because of the trees, insisting that the lighter colours will look gross and moldy which is definitely true as my drip edge is white now and they look terrible no matter how often I clean them.

My issue is I don't want to chose aesthetic over energy efficiency. 1/3 of the house is vaulted so there is no attic space above. And even if these Owen Corning Duration have this reflective granules and we add much more ventilation, will that be enough to keep my energy from going up? I don't think the roof guy is lying, I'm just concerned he doesn't actually know cause his job is to sell roofs, not know what happens after that.

TLDR, I have a lot of trees and live in central Florida. Roofer insisted with the Owen Corning Duration, colour doesn't matter much and he recommended black roof so it doesn't look dirty from tree debris. I'm concerned my energy bill will go up but he insists it won't cause they will be adding more ventilation. I have never seen a black roof here and I feel like there's a reason why.

  
Edit: just to clarify, the roof guy recommended the black or gray shingles, but it is ultimately my choice. he was not trying to push them onto me if it's coming across that way. I made a mockup and LOVED the black shingles.",2024-05-26 15:16:06

1907,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunny, love",Impact Windows and Low-E gains,"Hi all,

  
We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01

1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept.

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees.

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued.

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed.

Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up?

# Hurricanes

Hurricanes are part of living in Florida. Some years nothing happens, some years it's a wild ride.

If you're going to live beach side, then you need to take hurricanes seriously. Wind conditions leading up to them can and will cause the bridges to the mainland to close, meaning you can be cut off for extended periods from everything, including emergency services. Flooding/Storm Surge are real dangers to life and property. Make sure you have a plan way in advance for the high likelihood that you will lose both electricity and running water.

The further you get away from the coast and intracoastal zone, the lower the risks you have from severe damage from hurricanes, even major ones. But still have a plan, because anything can happen. Look for houses that have hurricane shutters or look into getting your home fit with them. Consider areas with buried power lines, as they're less likely to lose power. You can have a storm like Faye sit off the coast for days and flood almost everything. You can have tornadoes spawn from them. Fences are regular casualties of almost any named storm. Trees should be trimmed well in advance, paying close attention to when final collections occur before the storm hits so you don't have piles of potential wind debris laying in your yard.

That said: hurricanes are typically overblown by the media and should not be a major deterrent. As long as you have a plan and make sure that you're ready for the worst that could happen, you should almost always come out of the other side of hurricanes fine. Our local government knows how to handle them and a lot of infrastructure is built to withstand them. Most of us who have been through many of them don't consider anything Cat 3 or less to be anything more than a couple hour inconvenience. But always have a plan, no matter what.

# Car & Home Owners Insurance

Yes, Florida has one of the highest rates of Car & Home Owners insurance in the US. It is recommended you find an insurance broker who can shop around (at no cost to you) for the best rates for your needs. 

Car Insurance is required by law per vehicle per driver. 

# Toll Roads and You

Welcome to Florida, home of what seems like every toll road on the planet. You can certainly get around them, but it's significantly more efficient to use tolls.

E-pass Vs Sunpass: one or the other for all the tolls around Florida. Both are accepted across Florida, Georgia and North Carolina. E-PASS has less issues. Plus the advantage of their Uni, which is accepted across 18 states. Both gives you discounts on most tolls Florida.

1923,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunny, enjoy",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

I want to do a savage coastal themed one-liner for someone in Florida, but I'm rusty at insulting people, and I don't know coastal insults. 

I would also be happy to do other local-themed insults, like ones relating them to the terrible tourists, but honestly I wouldn't know where to even start. I would really, genuinely, appreciate the help.

Also tbh Floridians kinda intimidate me. I'm fully aware that I do not have the necessary psychological toughness or heat tolerance to survive in Florida. I don't know if my insults would have sufficient kick to really hit home.

The only ones that come to mind so far, I worry they might be too mean?

""You're the type to tear a gash in your hull because you think you're too good for radar or a map.""
 
and

""You'd get caught by a riptide because you'd think everyone was just avoiding the area to give you room for a selfie.""

Most of the water-themed ones that come to my mind are stuff like ""you'd catch a Sunny and think it was a Walleye"" or lake-specific burns, but I don't really know ocean fish that well and lakes and oceans are different.

Please help. They're taking property developer money to change zoning and take down a local racetrack down in Florida, and that's frankly just gross, and I'm ticked off.

Thank you for your help. Whether or not you reply, thank you for reading and I hope you have a really wonderful day. (I actually genuinely mean it.)

1933,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunny, comfortable",Heat film - effective heat reduction on old windows,"For those of us where replacing windows simply isn’t an option financially, or logistically, or because you’re a renter, just wanted to share a small success story on heat film.

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60’s?) single pane windows. I’m still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7° temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, “ewww. 80s? You lizard. 🦎“ ... Lol, the room is around 78° and is a completely uninsulated 1970’s porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I’m thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

1935,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunny, comfortable",Florida power outages? we don't care!,"Buckle up this ain't short. I am the Florida born and raised. I do not care about power outages it is irrelevant. It's back on in a few days or a few hours. Most people fear power outages in Florida due to the extreme temperatures and the inability to find air conditioning in such an occasion. So you are aware the Florida born and raised can wear black sweater and a hoodie outside as I do this everyday. I wore the black hoodie to keep the sunlight off me. Even when I worked outside doing manual labor I kept a sweater on me. At lunch time when you take it off everything feels frigid like you just walked into a 73° house. This all comes from personal experience. If you're not seasoned for heat then you probably shouldn't be in Florida. It takes time for your body to be acclimated to the harsh climate here. What most people would consider suffering humidity we as Floridians don't really even notice it most of the time. Because when you're born in it, that just makes it business as usual. I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone. Democracy dies in the state. Heat makes people only care about what's actually important. So if you're from up North welcome to the Republic.

I found the groceries to be expensive for just regular groceries and everything just seemed like a normal grocery store. But the pub subs were not good.

Am I missing something here? I really wanted to love it. Maybe I had too high of expectations. I live in Texas (while we have our own issues) places like HEB, Buc-ee’s, Whole Foods, Fresh Market are way superior than the Publix I went to.

I love that I live in a place where I can get on my bike and ride somewhere. But I struggle to take advantage of this in the summer. There is so much planning I need to do in order to not die from the heat. And then I can only be out for so long in the sun before I feel sick.

A lot of times I end up staying inside all day, paralyzed by trying to make the decision to go out while also trying to plan for all that would entail. A lot of the things I would prefer to do indoors tend to be out of budget for me - things like going to the movies or out to eat or shopping at the mall. I end up feeling guilty because I should be grateful that I get to live in this great state but am not taking advantage of all it has to offer during these months.

I spent a month in FTL then a week in Sarasota and night in Tallahassee. I'd love to spend more time in Tampa and Tallahassee! Tampa seems like a chiller/smaller Dallas on the ocean, with slightly more culture lol. Tallahassee is so incredibly beautiful with all the greenery and live oaks! 

There's so much to do! South Florida has so much access, to the Keys, Everglades, 2 major cruise ports, 3 large airports, amazing beaches, food, I could go on... 

Overall I was impressed with people! Everyone was so nice and chill! The drivers are insane (as they are in Dallas) but I found people were so much more genuinely nice than anticipated. (I blame Miami for the bad rap). 

All the nature and world class beaches really are just so amazing. FTL really has great access to beaches. And while I know the iguanas are invasive, I love lizards and found them fascinating. 

Side note: your summers are a notch down compared to Texas. Yes its hot. Yes it's humid. But at least yall get regular days of clouds or thunderstorms. That's exceedingly rare in Texas. you can't skimp on that sunscreen or hat though! The sun is no joke.

I've been here for 7 years and the only reason I'm leaving is the pay. I'm a scientist and state pay is like half what federal or other states pay. Decade plus of experience, $40k! Rant over.

I fell in love with it here. The palm trees, kayaking with manatees and gators, flocks of ibis, and the amazing beaches. I spent the morning with my wife at the beach, drove a while for dinner at the boathl house, and a fireworks show at Hollywood studios. I can't believe I'm leaving this paradise, even if I hate the politics and the hurricanes. 

As for things to do in Florida, I'd recommend staying for as long as you can. I'll miss you, you hot sweaty mess of a state!

Edit 1: should have been clearer since I'm getting undue sympathy. I currently make more than listed above. My contract is ending when grants expire. I've spent the last year applying for state jobs and the $40K is what I've been offered. I can't imagine surviving off that, so I'm headed to DC where they pay a living wage.

First, thank you all for the responses. They are so helpful.
To clarify, my family is composed of all adults over 25. We are quite a fit family and like the heat and love the ocean and beaches. August is the only month that was possible for us to get a vacation together as a whole family of 4.

**My notes:**
1. Get sunscreen. A lot of it!
2. Stay hydrated and bring plenty of water.
3. Wear UV-protective clothing.
4. Drive carefully and be nice to everyone.
5. Spend more days in the Keys area and less time in Fort Myers and Sarasota. Go to Tampa/St. Pete instead.

Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

Our latest electric bill was $316, and it has been going up for months. Last year this time in the same apartment was $260. Is this normal? I know people say DeSantis and his administration allowed utility price increase, but we have friends/family with 3-4 bedroom homes in Tampa Bay who pay $250 or less. Our A/C is always set to 71, which is strange because if our families kept their homes at 71 we would be freezing, but 73 and up here we are literally sweating. Recently, despite our A/C being set to 71 it constantly hovers at 73-74 and never actually gets down to 71. We have tried to get Duke/our landlord to look into what is going on, but they act like it’s normal.

Edited: I specifically put the comment about DeSantis to keep people from making this political. Regardless of who you voted for and what you think they did to Florida Utilities, that doesn’t explain our kWh going up since last July or our unit never being able to cool to the set temperature or our unit feeling hot even when at 73.

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60’s?) single pane windows. I’m still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7° temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, “ewww. 80s? You lizard. 🦎“ ... Lol, the room is around 78° and is a completely uninsulated 1970’s porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I’m thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

I could use some advice, especially if you are a roofing contractor or work in energy auditing but all are welcome.

I live in central Florida, where there's obviously a lot of hot sunny days. But I also live in a neighborhood where there are a lot of trees, my property has 11 in or around it. At all times at least a 1/3 of my house is under tree shade. My house is gabled if that is relevant, but the common area is vaulted.

I am having my house reroofed in two months. When I had the guy out for a quote I asked him if he had light coloured or cool roof options. He said yes, they use Owens Corning and these have reflective granules that help though he was very insistent to let me know they are not actually energy star. He said they used to be but no longer have that, so not sure if they changed the shingles or if the requirements for getting that changed and they just lost the certificate. I digress, He insisted that the colour I chose wouldn't effect it as much as I think, especially because he noted the ventilation currently is just two vents, and they will be adding shingle over ridge vents. He also suggested dark because of the trees, insisting that the lighter colours will look gross and moldy which is definitely true as my drip edge is white now and they look terrible no matter how often I clean them.

My issue is I don't want to chose aesthetic over energy efficiency. 1/3 of the house is vaulted so there is no attic space above. And even if these Owen Corning Duration have this reflective granules and we add much more ventilation, will that be enough to keep my energy from going up? I don't think the roof guy is lying, I'm just concerned he doesn't actually know cause his job is to sell roofs, not know what happens after that.

TLDR, I have a lot of trees and live in central Florida. Roofer insisted with the Owen Corning Duration, colour doesn't matter much and he recommended black roof so it doesn't look dirty from tree debris. I'm concerned my energy bill will go up but he insists it won't cause they will be adding more ventilation. I have never seen a black roof here and I feel like there's a reason why.

  
Edit: just to clarify, the roof guy recommended the black or gray shingles, but it is ultimately my choice. he was not trying to push them onto me if it's coming across that way. I made a mockup and LOVED the black shingles.",2024-05-26 15:16:06

I've seen some people say it's been especially hot these past couple of years over the summer, and I know September is too, but would you say that it would be an okay time and temperature?

Obviously going into October would be better, but also more expensive. I've been towards the end of November before, but due to costs September is currently the best option.

I live in the UK and today is 30°c. Which is very hot for us. But we also don't have ac at home. A couple of years ago it reached 40 here and it was unbearable.

Thanks everyone for the info, I think we'll be avoiding September now even if it's significantly cheaper. I don't want us to overheat and the chance of storms doesn't sound very fun.

1966,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, love",Impact Windows and Low-E gains,"Hi all,

  
We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01
1967,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, love",Hurricane Prep List.,"1. Charge any device that provides light. Laptops, tablets, cameras, video cameras, and old phones. Old cell phones can still used for dialing 911. Charge external battery backups. ( Glow sticks also provide light for a few hours. Stand them upright in a glass or jar to make a lantern.)
2. Wash all trash cans, big and small, and fill them with water for flushing toilets. Line outdoor trash cans with trash bags, fill them with water and store them in the garage. Add bleach to sterilize. 
3. Fill every tub and sink with water. Cover sinks with Saran Wrap to keep it from collecting dust. Fill the washing machine and leave the lid up to store water.
4. Fill old empty water bottles and other containers with water and keep them near sinks for washing hands. 
5. Fill every Tupperware with water and store it in the freezer. These will help keep food cold longer and serve as a backup water supply. 
6. Fill drinking cups with water and cover with Saran Wrap. Store as many as possible in the fridge. You can store the rest on the counter and use it before opening any water bottles. Ice is impossible to find after the storm.
7. Reserve fridge space for storing tap water and keep the sealed water bottles on the counter. 
8. Cook any meats in advance and other perishable foods. You can freeze cooked food. Hard boil eggs for snacks for the first day without power. 
9. Be well hydrated before the storm hits and avoid salty foods that make you dehydrated. 
10. Wash all dirty clothes and bed sheets. Anything dirty will smell without the A/C, you may need the items, and with no A/C, you'll be sweating a lot. You're going to want clean sheets. 
11. Toss out any expired food, clean cat litter boxes, and empty all trash cans in the house, including bathrooms. Remove anything that will cause an odor when the A/C is off. If you don't have a trash day pickup before the storm, find a dumpster. 
12. Bring in any yard decor, secure anything that will fly around, secure gates, bring in hoses, potted plants, etc. Bring in patio furniture and grills. 
13. Clean your environment so you have clear, easy escape routes. Even if that means temporarily moving furniture to one area. 
14. Scrub all bathrooms so you are starting with a clean odor-free environment. Store water-filled trash cans next to each toilet for flushing. 
15. Place everything you own that is important and necessary in a backpack or small file box that is easy to grab. Include your wallet with ID, phone, hand sanitizer, snacks, etc. Get plastic sleeves for important documents.
16. Make sure you have cash on hand.
17. Stock up on pet food and fill up bowls of water for pets. 
18. Refill any medications. Most insurance companies allow for 2 emergency refills per year.
19. Fill your propane tanks. You can heat soup cans, boil water, make coffee, and other stuff besides just grilling meat. Get an extra, if possible.
20. Drop your A/C in advance and lower temperatures in your fridges. 
21. Gather all candles, flashlights, lighters, matches, batteries, and other items and keep them accessible. 
22. Clean all counters in advance. Start with a clean surface. Buy Clorox Wipes for cleaning when there is no power. Mop your floors and vacuum. If power is out for 10 days, you'll have to live in the mess you started with. 
23. Pick your emergency safe place such as a closet under the stairs. Store the items you'll need in that location for the brunt of the storm. Make a hand fan for when the power is out. 
24. Shower just before the storm is scheduled to hit. 
25. Keep baby wipes next to each toilet. Don't flush them. It's not the time to risk clogging your toilet!
26. Run your dishwasher, don't risk having dirty smelly dishes and you need every container for water! Remember you'll need clean water for brushing your teeth, washing yourself, and cleaning your hands. 
27. Put a small suitcase in your car in case you decide to evacuate. Also, put at least one jug of water in your car. It will still be there if you don't evacuate!  Remember to pack for pets as well. 
28. Check on all family members, set up emergency backup plans, and check on elderly neighbors. 
29. Remember, pets are family too. Take them with you!
30. Before the storm, unplug all electronics. There will be power surges during and after the storm.
31. Gas up your car and have a spare gas container for your generator or your car when you run out.
32 . Use plastic cups and paper plates. 👍  You need water to wash dishes....👎
33 . Also if you run out of water tap your hot water heater it can have up to 30 gallons stored in there.
34 . Put water in balloons and store it in the freezer.
35 . If it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown Flush it down!💩
If you can, take a video of your house and contents....walk room to room--open cabinets/drawers and closets.  This will help if you need to make a claim later.  It will show proof of items and help you list all the items (help your memory, so you don't forget anything)...I highly recommend it!!!
I also heard you should freeze a cup of water, and place a coin on top after it is frozen...keep this in your freezer to help you gauge the temperature if the power goes out.  If the coin stays on top, the food is staying frozen.  If the coin falls into the water, the freezer thawed out and most food will likely need to be thrown away.  This is super helpful is you have to leave and come back, as it may appear everything is still frozen, but if the coin is in the cup--you will know!!",2024-10-09 14:45:24

1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

**That being said, if you were to road trip across Florida, for any given amount of time starting anywhere, stopping anywhere and ending anywhere, what would you be drawn to?**

Couple things I had in mind: 

•Driving through “The Bend” stopping at towns and parks along the way. 
•That but also through Appalachicola to PCB 
•Kayak Everglades NP from Everglades City 
•Ocala NF and Kissimmee Prairie 
•Probably something in or around the keys 

That’s about all I got so far ",2024-09-26 14:03:00

1979,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, love",An Open Letter to Spring Breakers. Come to Iceland. It's Wilder.,"# An Open Letter to Every Drunk Spring Breaker in Miami

By an Iceland-ish Friend

Dear Drunk College Students,

Going to Florida for one wild and crazy week a year makes sense. It is a very pretty place, with its palm trees and beaches and elderly population. You can eat breakfast at any time of the day and sometimes alligators cross the road. 

Do you know what crosses the road in Iceland my dear drunk friends? WILD HORSES and RAINBOWS. I don’t want to be a soggy beach blanket but perhaps it’s time to consider a more exotic destination for Spring Break, somewhere you can really go wild. Iceland baby!

You want to drink until you blackout and wake up with a strange sexy person in a mysterious and sexy place? We do that all the time but we drink Brennivin while lounging nuuude in geothermal jacuzzis and later, after we make love to an attractive person who we have verified we are not related to, we sometimes wake up under the Northern Lights. Vape that, Miami. 

One time, my cousin got me so drunk I browned out, I think that’s what you call it, and I came to on top of an active volcano. And let me tell you, there’s no cure for a hangover like running for your life from red hot lava, if you get my flow, my lava flow?

Doesn’t our country sound like an enchanting place? We don’t even need drugs here because we believe in fairies and frost giants and are home to dozens of rainbows each day. But wait, there’s more! We have ice diamond beaches, geysers, glaciers, the majestic Vestrahorn Mountains, puffin colonies, waterfalls, fermented shark, more waterfalls, Björk, and Black Death drink.

Ok ok, so your friends will all be in Flooorida or something. But according to my readings, Florida is sinking! Dearest drunks, it’s sliding into the ocean. What will happen to you if you’re dancing nudey groovy and suddenly dolphins swim by? Americans are very special but I’m pretty sure you don’t have gills. This is not the Little Mermaid. Stingrays and dolphins will be happy partying in your abandoned underwater South Beach dance clubs while you search for a new submarine condo.

I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to be negative. I take that back. Let’s start over ok? No more end of times talk. 

Don’t you spend enough time with your Spring Break friends already? Aren’t you a teensy weensy bit curious to explore our fascinating Icelandic gene pool? Everyone here is good looking, friendly, and extremely strong. It’s really great! 

If we were a little genetically more diverse I wouldn’t even be writing you this letter. See dear drunks, we have a little problem. Well it’s not a problem so much as it is an annoyance. We are a small country right? Very charming, no? Well, when you’re small, you have a lot more cousins than you think - almost all of us are at least a little bit related. Some smartypants even built an app to help us avoid smooches in the family tree, thanks be to Freyja.

But what would be really super cool would be if you would bring like, a whole lot of sexy American people to Iceland for Spring Break. Maybe you’ll like it and want to stay or we can all fall in love or you know, something. 

So please forget about Miami and Cancun and that beach in Texas and come Spring Break in Iceland. 

P.S. Don’t forget your sunscreen, rain poncho, wool socks, and party pants! See you soon!

I'm looking for a beach vacation toward the end of April or early May. I would love either beach recommendations or specific hotel recommendations would be even better. 

For the beach, I'd like the beach to be active but not crowded, I'd like to have water sport rentals nearby, and ideally for it to be a good looking beach with nice sand. Waves are nice but not a must. 

For the hotel, I'm willing to spend $300-$350 per night. I'd like it to have a classy vibe and cater to a middle-aged crowd (as opposed to college kids or old fogies). I'd really like it to have a decent hot tub, but a good pool isn't a requirement. As close to the beach as possible but on the beach not necessary to save on cost. Obviously good restaurants nearby are a major plus.

Thanks in advance!!

I keep my central AC at 73°. And my unit can mostly keep up and keep my home at around 76° during hot days. But yesterday was very hot. And my homes temperature were at 80°. Last year I experienced similar temps during the hottest days of the year in September. But seeing how we're in May and already experiencing super hot days. I figured I need to do something about this.

Anyways my central AC unit has no issues. It's a few years old. Filters are clean. Indoor and outdoor condenser and radiators are clean. Its my mistake for not ordering a larger unit knowing how summers get here in Florida. 

A new central unit is very expensive. Rather than spend several thousands of dollars to replace mine. I was thinking I can install a window unit to help my central AC cool my home more quickly. — at least as a temporary solution as I set aside funds to eventually replace the central AC unit.

For anyone that currently has a similar setup.

My elderly father has tasked me with finding a ~1 month rental this winter somewhere in FL so that my entire family (spread around the country) can come visit and we can see one another. Several adults, one elderly man, and some children. None of my family is familiar with FL at all, and I've never even been there. I'm here to see if anyone has any suggestions of what places I should look at, given our wishlist, which is fairly short:  
1) Warm/hot in February. I naively assumed the entire state would fit the bill here, but was recently told by someone that that is not the case. Ideally, it would be sufficiently warm to enter the ocean/swim in a pool in Feb. Does that limit me to only south FL?  
2) Walkable urban core. My father no longer drives and wants to be able to walk around to, you know, shops, restaurants, bars, that type of thing. I have read that these are rare in FL, but basically we don't want to rent a house in a suburb and have to drive everywhere. It doesn't have to be a major downtown (although it could be), but any type of that mini-downtown/touristy area. It's fine if it is touristy, since we'll be tourists!  
3) Near the coast. We probably can't afford to rent a place directly on the coast, but ideally we'd be walkable to a beach, or at least a short drive/bike ride. So, basically not central FL.  
Would love any suggestions folks have - and thanks so much in advance. If I'm missing any integral info, let me know and I'll add it to the post. Thanks!",2023-07-11 14:20:11
1987,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, love","Golden Magnolia Resort in Flagler Beach, FL - AVOID!","For my wife and my 20th wedding anniversary, I had the bright idea to go back to the bed and breakfast we had stayed at on our honeymoon.  At the time, it was a small, quiet and nice bed and breakfast in Flagler Beach named the White Orchid Inn.  We loved that place.  Since then, it is under new ownership and is now named the Golden Magnolia Resort.  It now sucks and is WAY overpriced.

1. The stairs leading up to the second floor rooms are shaky and you have to use the handrails to not fall.  However, the handrails have broken and chipped paint that hurt your hands and are rusting.  Even the property manager told us she doesn't like going up and down those stairs.

2.  The drain in the hot tub looks like it spent the last 20 years under water on a ship wreck.  It was so rusted, we did not feel comfortable using it.

3.  The swimming pool and the heated mineral pool were filthy.  We actually used the skimmer to try to clean the mineral pool ourselves, but once we got in, we saw all the scum on the tiles and quickly got out.

4.  The towels were stained and had large rips.

5.  The wifi and TV service never worked the entire time we were there.

6.  Our plans changed and we needed to leave a day early.  I talked to the property manager and she said she would change the reservation and refund us what we had paid for the last night of the stay that we wouldn't be using.  We left by 10am that morning so they had plenty of time to clean the room and prepare it for someone else.  It turned out that she lied and never gave us the refund.  When we complained afterwards through Expedia's customer service, they tried contacting the property but could not get approval for the refund so we ended up paying over $300 for a night in a room we didn't use even after being assured that wouldn't happen.

7.  The nice and quiet atmosphere is now ruined by a bar that is directly adjacent to the property.  Our room was on the opposite side of the property but we still could hear the customers and the music through the walls until after 2am each night.

8.  One of the ""features"" they mention is that you are within view of the historical Flagler Beach pier.  They don't mention it was badly damaged in a storm over 2 years ago and has not been repaired and is just boarded up.  The last section of it looks like it will fall into the ocean anytime now.

9.  One of the two mornings we were there, we came down for breakfast and were told that the cook just didn't show up that day so our bed and breakfast had no breakfast but no compensation was offered for this.10.  The waitress was telling us private stuff about other staff members like a cracked skull during a fight with her boyfriend.  That isn't the story you want to hear on your romantic anniversary trip and should have been told to the police instead or out of town customers.

Overall, this place is poorly managed, not maintained and way overpriced for what you are getting.  I highly recommend avoiding it and if you have reservations already, cancel them and then monitor your credit card to make sure they don't charge you anyway.",2024-04-12 13:42:02

Suburbs that were already built before the car became the norm (1950-1960s) in the American society are better than gated communities and modern suburbs. But unfortunately, not every suburb is the same and logically, some are worse than others not just because of poverty, in particular, how people commute to work. 

This is what pisses me off about how modern suburbs are lobbied, and then build a weird nonsensical city like Cape Coral and Port St. Lucie. Before I started realizing what we were doing wrong with our infrastructure, I used to think Port St. Lucie is an amazing city, it still is. But the problem with Port St. Lucie is that there's almost not other option for commuters besides spending too much money on cars and biking in Port St. Lucie is probably a hassle than if I live in a suburb in Broward county. One, they barely have bike lanes. Two, jobs are far from where you live; it is and endless sea of homes and the jobs are more than a mile drive from the suburb. Most of the high paying jobs are concentrated in West Palm Beach. 

It is understandable why some people prefer Port St. Lucie and Cape Coral over the suburbs in South Florida. Housing is cheap (used to be before the pandemic and desanctimonious). Parking lots were available for drivers and less overcrowding. There was barely an incentive for public transit, at least when it was growing. Now, there's already too many people in the same area and there has to be a lot of changes with its infrastructure. 

Also, and despite how pricy Brightline is, I hate how they not planned a station there. 

As for Cape Coral, it's more of an environmental wasteland than Port St. Lucie and I mean it. Almost no trees, hot/humid af, unattractive for cyclists, bad public transportation, its downtown really need changes. Of course, these changes won't happen overnight and it's likely they will be stifled by the suburbanite nimby crowd if it were to happen; except if there were a tollway or an interstate.",2023-05-23 13:52:17

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60’s?) single pane windows. I’m still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7° temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, “ewww. 80s? You lizard. 🦎“ ... Lol, the room is around 78° and is a completely uninsulated 1970’s porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I’m thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

I've seen some people say it's been especially hot these past couple of years over the summer, and I know September is too, but would you say that it would be an okay time and temperature?

Obviously going into October would be better, but also more expensive. I've been towards the end of November before, but due to costs September is currently the best option.

I live in the UK and today is 30°c. Which is very hot for us. But we also don't have ac at home. A couple of years ago it reached 40 here and it was unbearable.

Edit:

Thanks everyone for the info, I think we'll be avoiding September now even if it's significantly cheaper. I don't want us to overheat and the chance of storms doesn't sound very fun.

Many Transplants make my blood boil.","I made a post here about a week ago that the hate on transplants was uncalled for and childish. I argued that people are gonna do what they’re gonna do and act in their self interests. My mindset has changed to where us wanting them the fuck out is a take that’s just fine, as we are also allowed to act in our self interests.

I read all your comments and now I pretty much fully agree with the sentiment here. I officially moved back on the 21st of December so; hell I’m still adjusting. However I lived here for the preceding 33 years of my life(currently 37). The only shock is how the people changed.

But today I was walking around the Tampa burbs at the store and someone legit said “wow it’s hot outside compared to New Jersey” and I’m like “my brother in Christ, you will not survive”. Bunch of transplants and to-be transplants here on Reddit don’t take the advice that this is a horrible state to raise a kid. This is not the best place to be in general regarding workers rights and wages, they don’t take the well informed advice that you shouldn’t move here unless you have an actual good job lined up. they don’t even acknowledge it. They are either willfully ignorant or just ignorant.

I’ve been here long enough now to see that we are freaking full.

I saw a post asking what’s a place in FL that’s like NYC and I guess that crap really grinded my gears enough to follow up on my hot take.

The complete disregard that Florida has its own set of values and subculture of the greater US annoys me, greatly. Many, NOT all, but now a measurable number legitimately believe that Florida should conform to where THEY came from.

Very annoying and fuck that. Very sad to see what happened to our state. I made a crummy argument in my last post that was not based on enough empirical evidence from the general  public.",2023-01-23 02:40:15
2014,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, hate",Hurricane Prep List.,"1. Charge any device that provides light. Laptops, tablets, cameras, video cameras, and old phones. Old cell phones can still used for dialing 911. Charge external battery backups. ( Glow sticks also provide light for a few hours. Stand them upright in a glass or jar to make a lantern.)
2. Wash all trash cans, big and small, and fill them with water for flushing toilets. Line outdoor trash cans with trash bags, fill them with water and store them in the garage. Add bleach to sterilize. 
3. Fill every tub and sink with water. Cover sinks with Saran Wrap to keep it from collecting dust. Fill the washing machine and leave the lid up to store water.
4. Fill old empty water bottles and other containers with water and keep them near sinks for washing hands. 
5. Fill every Tupperware with water and store it in the freezer. These will help keep food cold longer and serve as a backup water supply. 
6. Fill drinking cups with water and cover with Saran Wrap. Store as many as possible in the fridge. You can store the rest on the counter and use it before opening any water bottles. Ice is impossible to find after the storm.
7. Reserve fridge space for storing tap water and keep the sealed water bottles on the counter. 
8. Cook any meats in advance and other perishable foods. You can freeze cooked food. Hard boil eggs for snacks for the first day without power. 
9. Be well hydrated before the storm hits and avoid salty foods that make you dehydrated. 
10. Wash all dirty clothes and bed sheets. Anything dirty will smell without the A/C, you may need the items, and with no A/C, you'll be sweating a lot. You're going to want clean sheets. 
11. Toss out any expired food, clean cat litter boxes, and empty all trash cans in the house, including bathrooms. Remove anything that will cause an odor when the A/C is off. If you don't have a trash day pickup before the storm, find a dumpster. 
12. Bring in any yard decor, secure anything that will fly around, secure gates, bring in hoses, potted plants, etc. Bring in patio furniture and grills. 
13. Clean your environment so you have clear, easy escape routes. Even if that means temporarily moving furniture to one area. 
14. Scrub all bathrooms so you are starting with a clean odor-free environment. Store water-filled trash cans next to each toilet for flushing. 
15. Place everything you own that is important and necessary in a backpack or small file box that is easy to grab. Include your wallet with ID, phone, hand sanitizer, snacks, etc. Get plastic sleeves for important documents.
16. Make sure you have cash on hand.
17. Stock up on pet food and fill up bowls of water for pets. 
18. Refill any medications. Most insurance companies allow for 2 emergency refills per year.
19. Fill your propane tanks. You can heat soup cans, boil water, make coffee, and other stuff besides just grilling meat. Get an extra, if possible.
20. Drop your A/C in advance and lower temperatures in your fridges. 
21. Gather all candles, flashlights, lighters, matches, batteries, and other items and keep them accessible. 
22. Clean all counters in advance. Start with a clean surface. Buy Clorox Wipes for cleaning when there is no power. Mop your floors and vacuum. If power is out for 10 days, you'll have to live in the mess you started with. 
23. Pick your emergency safe place such as a closet under the stairs. Store the items you'll need in that location for the brunt of the storm. Make a hand fan for when the power is out. 
24. Shower just before the storm is scheduled to hit. 
25. Keep baby wipes next to each toilet. Don't flush them. It's not the time to risk clogging your toilet!
26. Run your dishwasher, don't risk having dirty smelly dishes and you need every container for water! Remember you'll need clean water for brushing your teeth, washing yourself, and cleaning your hands. 
27. Put a small suitcase in your car in case you decide to evacuate. Also, put at least one jug of water in your car. It will still be there if you don't evacuate!  Remember to pack for pets as well. 
28. Check on all family members, set up emergency backup plans, and check on elderly neighbors. 
29. Remember, pets are family too. Take them with you!
30. Before the storm, unplug all electronics. There will be power surges during and after the storm.
31. Gas up your car and have a spare gas container for your generator or your car when you run out.
32 . Use plastic cups and paper plates. 👍  You need water to wash dishes....👎
33 . Also if you run out of water tap your hot water heater it can have up to 30 gallons stored in there.
34 . Put water in balloons and store it in the freezer.
35 . If it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown Flush it down!💩
If you can, take a video of your house and contents....walk room to room--open cabinets/drawers and closets.  This will help if you need to make a claim later.  It will show proof of items and help you list all the items (help your memory, so you don't forget anything)...I highly recommend it!!!
I also heard you should freeze a cup of water, and place a coin on top after it is frozen...keep this in your freezer to help you gauge the temperature if the power goes out.  If the coin stays on top, the food is staying frozen.  If the coin falls into the water, the freezer thawed out and most food will likely need to be thrown away.  This is super helpful is you have to leave and come back, as it may appear everything is still frozen, but if the coin is in the cup--you will know!!",2024-10-09 14:45:24

1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

Last year I experienced similar temps during the hottest days of the year in September. But seeing how we're in May and already experiencing super hot days. I figured I need to do something about this.

Anyways my central AC unit has no issues. It's a few years old. Filters are clean. Indoor and outdoor condenser and radiators are clean. Its my mistake for not ordering a larger unit knowing how summers get here in Florida. 

A new central unit is very expensive. Rather than spend several thousands of dollars to replace mine. I was thinking I can install a window unit to help my central AC cool my home more quickly. — at least as a temporary solution as I set aside funds to eventually replace the central AC unit.

2036,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, enjoy",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

Our latest electric bill was $316, and it has been going up for months. Last year this time in the same apartment was $260. Is this normal? I know people say DeSantis and his administration allowed utility price increase, but we have friends/family with 3-4 bedroom homes in Tampa Bay who pay $250 or less. Our A/C is always set to 71, which is strange because if our families kept their homes at 71 we would be freezing, but 73 and up here we are literally sweating. Recently, despite our A/C being set to 71 it constantly hovers at 73-74 and never actually gets down to 71. We have tried to get Duke/our landlord to look into what is going on, but they act like it’s normal.

Edited: I specifically put the comment about DeSantis to keep people from making this political. Regardless of who you voted for and what you think they did to Florida Utilities, that doesn’t explain our kWh going up since last July or our unit never being able to cool to the set temperature or our unit feeling hot even when at 73.

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60’s?) single pane windows. I’m still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7° temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, “ewww. 80s? You lizard. 🦎“ ... Lol, the room is around 78° and is a completely uninsulated 1970’s porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I’m thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

Obviously going into October would be better, but also more expensive. I've been towards the end of November before, but due to costs September is currently the best option.

I live in the UK and today is 30°c. Which is very hot for us. But we also don't have ac at home. A couple of years ago it reached 40 here and it was unbearable.

2043,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, enjoy","I-4, I-10, I-75, and I-95. How would you rank them and which one to you is the least headache inducing?","I've not really been on Interstate 10, because I've truthfully never ventured into the panhandle

 I-4 is always a disaster whenever I get onto it, pretty much anything from Tampa all the way to Sanford sucks in the worst ways possible. Anything can go wrong on any second of that highway, so you have to take extreme precautions and measures when getting on to the interstate, and deciding when the best time it is to merge, speed, slow down, and especially watching for where to get off at. It's like a game of cards except that the odds are completely stacked against you. If you mess up and make a wrong turn off a wrong exit, it might set you back another 20-30 minutes. If someone crashes, the whole road will get shut down. There aren't that many places to stop off at. Getting off is hardly an option. But I think the worst thing about I-4 is that there are no alternative routes to it. If you're driving from Orlando over to Tampa or Lakeland, it's I-4 or nothing, and you can't really avoid it, which doesn't help the horrible traffic situation. It's the busiest corridor in all of Florida. It also doesn't help that most of the road is urbanized as between Tampa and Orlando, you also have Polk County which consists of Lakeland and Winter Haven. And then north of that you have Disney and all the theme parks and international traveling that makes going all the way to Orlando absolute hell. You get to see the melting pot of all the worst drivers in Florida and across the entire country. All of that contributes to definitely making I-4 one of the least fun driving experiences in the entire country in my opinion.

I live on the east coast but much like I-4, I-95 is also practically urbanized almost all the way down. You got Jacksonville, Daytona Beach, Melbourne, Port St Lucie, West Palm, Boca, Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood, and Miami. Driving 95 up and down, there's really only a few stretches of it where there's pockets of it that's rural and underdeveloped like south of Daytona to Titusville, or having less less traffic density like around the Vero Sebastian area.

I-75 is weird, because aside from Tampa there aren't that many large cities like 95 has. You start in the Miami area, and of course you have Naples, Fort Myers, and Sarasota which are major hot spots and fast growing areas. You got 275 in the Tampa Bay area, which connects St Petersburg and the rest of Pinellas and into downtown Tampa. But north of that, it's mostly nothing all the way to Georgia, with really only Ocala, Gainesville and The Villages being alongside it.


I personally don't really enjoy driving any of the main interstates in Florida, and often try my best to avoid them when I can, but oftentimes we don't have a choice, but I would still take 75 and 95 over having to ride I-4 everyday.

Old cell phones can still used for dialing 911. Charge external battery backups. ( Glow sticks also provide light for a few hours. Stand them upright in a glass or jar to make a lantern.)
2. Wash all trash cans, big and small, and fill them with water for flushing toilets. Line outdoor trash cans with trash bags, fill them with water and store them in the garage. Add bleach to sterilize. 
3. Fill every tub and sink with water. Cover sinks with Saran Wrap to keep it from collecting dust. Fill the washing machine and leave the lid up to store water.
4. Fill old empty water bottles and other containers with water and keep them near sinks for washing hands. 
5. Fill every Tupperware with water and store it in the freezer. These will help keep food cold longer and serve as a backup water supply. 
6. Fill drinking cups with water and cover with Saran Wrap. Store as many as possible in the fridge. You can store the rest on the counter and use it before opening any water bottles. Ice is impossible to find after the storm.
7. Reserve fridge space for storing tap water and keep the sealed water bottles on the counter. 
8. Cook any meats in advance and other perishable foods. You can freeze cooked food. Hard boil eggs for snacks for the first day without power. 
9. Be well hydrated before the storm hits and avoid salty foods that make you dehydrated. 
10. Wash all dirty clothes and bed sheets. Anything dirty will smell without the A/C, you may need the items, and with no A/C, you'll be sweating a lot. You're going to want clean sheets. 
11. Toss out any expired food, clean cat litter boxes, and empty all trash cans in the house, including bathrooms. Remove anything that will cause an odor when the A/C is off. If you don't have a trash day pickup before the storm, find a dumpster. 
12. Bring in any yard decor, secure anything that will fly around, secure gates, bring in hoses, potted plants, etc. Bring in patio furniture and grills. 
13. Clean your environment so you have clear, easy escape routes. Even if that means temporarily moving furniture to one area. 
14. Scrub all bathrooms so you are starting with a clean odor-free environment. Store water-filled trash cans next to each toilet for flushing. 
15. Place everything you own that is important and necessary in a backpack or small file box that is easy to grab. Include your wallet with ID, phone, hand sanitizer, snacks, etc. Get plastic sleeves for important documents.
16. Make sure you have cash on hand.
17. Stock up on pet food and fill up bowls of water for pets. 
18. Refill any medications. Most insurance companies allow for 2 emergency refills per year.
19. Fill your propane tanks. You can heat soup cans, boil water, make coffee, and other stuff besides just grilling meat. Get an extra, if possible.
20. Drop your A/C in advance and lower temperatures in your fridges. 
21. Gather all candles, flashlights, lighters, matches, batteries, and other items and keep them accessible. 
22. Clean all counters in advance. Start with a clean surface. Buy Clorox Wipes for cleaning when there is no power. Mop your floors and vacuum. If power is out for 10 days, you'll have to live in the mess you started with. 
23. Pick your emergency safe place such as a closet under the stairs. Store the items you'll need in that location for the brunt of the storm. Make a hand fan for when the power is out. 
24. Shower just before the storm is scheduled to hit. 
25. Keep baby wipes next to each toilet. Don't flush them. It's not the time to risk clogging your toilet!
26. Run your dishwasher, don't risk having dirty smelly dishes and you need every container for water! Remember you'll need clean water for brushing your teeth, washing yourself, and cleaning your hands. 
27. Put a small suitcase in your car in case you decide to evacuate. Also, put at least one jug of water in your car. It will still be there if you don't evacuate!  Remember to pack for pets as well. 
28. Check on all family members, set up emergency backup plans, and check on elderly neighbors. 
29. Remember, pets are family too. Take them with you!
30. Before the storm, unplug all electronics. There will be power surges during and after the storm.
31. Gas up your car and have a spare gas container for your generator or your car when you run out.
32 . Use plastic cups and paper plates. 👍  You need water to wash dishes....👎
33 . Also if you run out of water tap your hot water heater it can have up to 30 gallons stored in there.
34 . Put water in balloons and store it in the freezer.
35 . If it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown Flush it down!💩
If you can, take a video of your house and contents....walk room to room--open cabinets/drawers and closets.  This will help if you need to make a claim later.  It will show proof of items and help you list all the items (help your memory, so you don't forget anything)...I highly recommend it!!!
I also heard you should freeze a cup of water, and place a coin on top after it is frozen...keep this in your freezer to help you gauge the temperature if the power goes out.  If the coin stays on top, the food is staying frozen.  If the coin falls into the water, the freezer thawed out and most food will likely need to be thrown away.  This is super helpful is you have to leave and come back, as it may appear everything is still frozen, but if the coin is in the cup--you will know!!",2024-10-09 14:45:24

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

Anyways my central AC unit has no issues. It's a few years old. Filters are clean. Indoor and outdoor condenser and radiators are clean. Its my mistake for not ordering a larger unit knowing how summers get here in Florida. 

A new central unit is very expensive. Rather than spend several thousands of dollars to replace mine. I was thinking I can install a window unit to help my central AC cool my home more quickly. — at least as a temporary solution as I set aside funds to eventually replace the central AC unit.

In the next 4 years my family and I are interested in moving to Florida for our daughter's college interests.

And I have been in my fair share of hurricanes so with any luck it'll be fine.

My question is: Are there any good, safe, family oriented communities around the Tampa, Sarasota, Orlando-ish areas. Less populated would be preferable. If the area is also quite walkable that would be a plus. Though my number one priority is safety and low crime.

2065,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, dislike",Hurricane Prep List.,"1. Charge any device that provides light. Laptops, tablets, cameras, video cameras, and old phones. Old cell phones can still used for dialing 911. Charge external battery backups. ( Glow sticks also provide light for a few hours. Stand them upright in a glass or jar to make a lantern.)
2. Wash all trash cans, big and small, and fill them with water for flushing toilets. Line outdoor trash cans with trash bags, fill them with water and store them in the garage. Add bleach to sterilize. 
3. Fill every tub and sink with water. Cover sinks with Saran Wrap to keep it from collecting dust. Fill the washing machine and leave the lid up to store water.
4. Fill old empty water bottles and other containers with water and keep them near sinks for washing hands. 
5. Fill every Tupperware with water and store it in the freezer. These will help keep food cold longer and serve as a backup water supply. 
6. Fill drinking cups with water and cover with Saran Wrap. Store as many as possible in the fridge. You can store the rest on the counter and use it before opening any water bottles. Ice is impossible to find after the storm.
7. Reserve fridge space for storing tap water and keep the sealed water bottles on the counter. 
8. Cook any meats in advance and other perishable foods. You can freeze cooked food. Hard boil eggs for snacks for the first day without power. 
9. Be well hydrated before the storm hits and avoid salty foods that make you dehydrated. 
10. Wash all dirty clothes and bed sheets. Anything dirty will smell without the A/C, you may need the items, and with no A/C, you'll be sweating a lot. You're going to want clean sheets. 
11. Toss out any expired food, clean cat litter boxes, and empty all trash cans in the house, including bathrooms. Remove anything that will cause an odor when the A/C is off. If you don't have a trash day pickup before the storm, find a dumpster. 
12. Bring in any yard decor, secure anything that will fly around, secure gates, bring in hoses, potted plants, etc. Bring in patio furniture and grills. 
13. Clean your environment so you have clear, easy escape routes. Even if that means temporarily moving furniture to one area. 
14. Scrub all bathrooms so you are starting with a clean odor-free environment. Store water-filled trash cans next to each toilet for flushing. 
15. Place everything you own that is important and necessary in a backpack or small file box that is easy to grab. Include your wallet with ID, phone, hand sanitizer, snacks, etc. Get plastic sleeves for important documents.
16. Make sure you have cash on hand.
17. Stock up on pet food and fill up bowls of water for pets. 
18. Refill any medications. Most insurance companies allow for 2 emergency refills per year.
19. Fill your propane tanks. You can heat soup cans, boil water, make coffee, and other stuff besides just grilling meat. Get an extra, if possible.
20. Drop your A/C in advance and lower temperatures in your fridges. 
21. Gather all candles, flashlights, lighters, matches, batteries, and other items and keep them accessible. 
22. Clean all counters in advance. Start with a clean surface. Buy Clorox Wipes for cleaning when there is no power. Mop your floors and vacuum. If power is out for 10 days, you'll have to live in the mess you started with. 
23. Pick your emergency safe place such as a closet under the stairs. Store the items you'll need in that location for the brunt of the storm. Make a hand fan for when the power is out. 
24. Shower just before the storm is scheduled to hit. 
25. Keep baby wipes next to each toilet. Don't flush them. It's not the time to risk clogging your toilet!
26. Run your dishwasher, don't risk having dirty smelly dishes and you need every container for water! Remember you'll need clean water for brushing your teeth, washing yourself, and cleaning your hands. 
27. Put a small suitcase in your car in case you decide to evacuate. Also, put at least one jug of water in your car. It will still be there if you don't evacuate!  Remember to pack for pets as well. 
28. Check on all family members, set up emergency backup plans, and check on elderly neighbors. 
29. Remember, pets are family too. Take them with you!
30. Before the storm, unplug all electronics. There will be power surges during and after the storm.
31. Gas up your car and have a spare gas container for your generator or your car when you run out.
32 . Use plastic cups and paper plates. 👍  You need water to wash dishes....👎
33 . Also if you run out of water tap your hot water heater it can have up to 30 gallons stored in there.
34 . Put water in balloons and store it in the freezer.
35 . If it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown Flush it down!💩
If you can, take a video of your house and contents....walk room to room--open cabinets/drawers and closets.  This will help if you need to make a claim later.  It will show proof of items and help you list all the items (help your memory, so you don't forget anything)...I highly recommend it!!!
I also heard you should freeze a cup of water, and place a coin on top after it is frozen...keep this in your freezer to help you gauge the temperature if the power goes out.  If the coin stays on top, the food is staying frozen.  If the coin falls into the water, the freezer thawed out and most food will likely need to be thrown away.  This is super helpful is you have to leave and come back, as it may appear everything is still frozen, but if the coin is in the cup--you will know!!",2024-10-09 14:45:24

I keep my central AC at 73°. And my unit can mostly keep up and keep my home at around 76° during hot days. But yesterday was very hot. And my homes temperature were at 80°. Last year I experienced similar temps during the hottest days of the year in September. But seeing how we're in May and already experiencing super hot days. I figured I need to do something about this.

Anyways my central AC unit has no issues. It's a few years old. Filters are clean. Indoor and outdoor condenser and radiators are clean. Its my mistake for not ordering a larger unit knowing how summers get here in Florida. 

A new central unit is very expensive. Rather than spend several thousands of dollars to replace mine. I was thinking I can install a window unit to help my central AC cool my home more quickly. — at least as a temporary solution as I set aside funds to eventually replace the central AC unit.

For anyone that currently has a similar setup.

I argued that people are gonna do what they’re gonna do and act in their self interests. My mindset has changed to where us wanting them the fuck out is a take that’s just fine, as we are also allowed to act in our self interests.

I read all your comments and now I pretty much fully agree with the sentiment here. I officially moved back on the 21st of December so; hell I’m still adjusting. However I lived here for the preceding 33 years of my life(currently 37). The only shock is how the people changed.

But today I was walking around the Tampa burbs at the store and someone legit said “wow it’s hot outside compared to New Jersey” and I’m like “my brother in Christ, you will not survive”. Bunch of transplants and to-be transplants here on Reddit don’t take the advice that this is a horrible state to raise a kid. This is not the best place to be in general regarding workers rights and wages, they don’t take the well informed advice that you shouldn’t move here unless you have an actual good job lined up. they don’t even acknowledge it. They are either willfully ignorant or just ignorant.

The complete disregard that Florida has its own set of values and subculture of the greater US annoys me, greatly. Many, NOT all, but now a measurable number legitimately believe that Florida should conform to where THEY came from.

Very annoying and fuck that. Very sad to see what happened to our state. I made a crummy argument in my last post that was not based on enough empirical evidence from the general  public.",2023-01-23 02:40:15

2088,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, annoying",An Open Letter to Spring Breakers. Come to Iceland. It's Wilder.,"# An Open Letter to Every Drunk Spring Breaker in Miami

By an Iceland-ish Friend

Dear Drunk College Students,

Going to Florida for one wild and crazy week a year makes sense. It is a very pretty place, with its palm trees and beaches and elderly population. You can eat breakfast at any time of the day and sometimes alligators cross the road. 

Do you know what crosses the road in Iceland my dear drunk friends? WILD HORSES and RAINBOWS. I don’t want to be a soggy beach blanket but perhaps it’s time to consider a more exotic destination for Spring Break, somewhere you can really go wild. Iceland baby!

You want to drink until you blackout and wake up with a strange sexy person in a mysterious and sexy place? We do that all the time but we drink Brennivin while lounging nuuude in geothermal jacuzzis and later, after we make love to an attractive person who we have verified we are not related to, we sometimes wake up under the Northern Lights. Vape that, Miami. 

One time, my cousin got me so drunk I browned out, I think that’s what you call it, and I came to on top of an active volcano. And let me tell you, there’s no cure for a hangover like running for your life from red hot lava, if you get my flow, my lava flow?

Doesn’t our country sound like an enchanting place? We don’t even need drugs here because we believe in fairies and frost giants and are home to dozens of rainbows each day. But wait, there’s more! We have ice diamond beaches, geysers, glaciers, the majestic Vestrahorn Mountains, puffin colonies, waterfalls, fermented shark, more waterfalls, Björk, and Black Death drink.

Ok ok, so your friends will all be in Flooorida or something. But according to my readings, Florida is sinking! Dearest drunks, it’s sliding into the ocean. What will happen to you if you’re dancing nudey groovy and suddenly dolphins swim by? Americans are very special but I’m pretty sure you don’t have gills. This is not the Little Mermaid. Stingrays and dolphins will be happy partying in your abandoned underwater South Beach dance clubs while you search for a new submarine condo.

I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to be negative. I take that back. Let’s start over ok? No more end of times talk. 

Don’t you spend enough time with your Spring Break friends already? Aren’t you a teensy weensy bit curious to explore our fascinating Icelandic gene pool? Everyone here is good looking, friendly, and extremely strong. It’s really great! 

If we were a little genetically more diverse I wouldn’t even be writing you this letter. See dear drunks, we have a little problem. Well it’s not a problem so much as it is an annoyance. We are a small country right? Very charming, no? Well, when you’re small, you have a lot more cousins than you think - almost all of us are at least a little bit related. Some smartypants even built an app to help us avoid smooches in the family tree, thanks be to Freyja.

But what would be really super cool would be if you would bring like, a whole lot of sexy American people to Iceland for Spring Break. Maybe you’ll like it and want to stay or we can all fall in love or you know, something. 

So please forget about Miami and Cancun and that beach in Texas and come Spring Break in Iceland. 

P.S. Don’t forget your sunscreen, rain poncho, wool socks, and party pants! See you soon!

I keep my central AC at 73°. And my unit can mostly keep up and keep my home at around 76° during hot days. But yesterday was very hot. And my homes temperature were at 80°. Last year I experienced similar temps during the hottest days of the year in September. But seeing how we're in May and already experiencing super hot days. I figured I need to do something about this.

Anyways my central AC unit has no issues. It's a few years old. Filters are clean. Indoor and outdoor condenser and radiators are clean. Its my mistake for not ordering a larger unit knowing how summers get here in Florida. 

A new central unit is very expensive. Rather than spend several thousands of dollars to replace mine. I was thinking I can install a window unit to help my central AC cool my home more quickly. — at least as a temporary solution as I set aside funds to eventually replace the central AC unit.

For anyone that currently has a similar setup.

Edited: I specifically put the comment about DeSantis to keep people from making this political. Regardless of who you voted for and what you think they did to Florida Utilities, that doesn’t explain our kWh going up since last July or our unit never being able to cool to the set temperature or our unit feeling hot even when at 73.

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60’s?) single pane windows. I’m still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7° temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, “ewww. 80s? You lizard. 🦎“ ... Lol, the room is around 78° and is a completely uninsulated 1970’s porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I’m thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

Obviously going into October would be better, but also more expensive. I've been towards the end of November before, but due to costs September is currently the best option.

I live in the UK and today is 30°c. Which is very hot for us. But we also don't have ac at home. A couple of years ago it reached 40 here and it was unbearable.

Edit:

Thanks everyone for the info, I think we'll be avoiding September now even if it's significantly cheaper. I don't want us to overheat and the chance of storms doesn't sound very fun.

I talked to my GF and we want to change some plans. For all who don't know we want to go in September which is not the best time, but we don't have an other choice.

So:

9/11 arriving at Orlando and staying in a Hotel near the airport

9/12-9/15 going to Miami. Don't really have plans yet but want to do a boats tour and maybe visit Bills @ Dolphins (depending on the ticket prices), maybe also going to the beach if there is no hurricane lol

9/15-9/18 we heading to Marathon. We decided to stay in the middle of the Key's just to be flexible. I definitely want to go snorkeling and someone suggested a boat trip with glass underneath, so that sounds promessing. 

9/18-9/19 that's the part were i'm currently not happy with. My Girlfriend wants to stay in Homestead for the Everglades. I'm fine with doing an air boat tour but she also want to do a little hike. Already told her it's hot and humid but she probably needs to hear that from Florida natives. Arccording to google it's a 90 min drive so we could start the ""hike"" early but not sure about that.

9/19-9/22 staying in Sarasota. Maybe also snorkeling and going to the beach

9/22-9/24 not sure about that. Would go to Tampa for a Bucs game. I googled for sightseeing in tampa and there are tours to watch dolphins that would be nice, but not sure if I can do that also on the other locations like Marathon?

9/24-9/26 Going back to Orlando. My Girlfriend may want to go to Disney World but that will be a day trip.

9/26 flight back to germany

  
Yesterday was naples in there, but a lot of you guys said we should skip that so that's the updated plan. Idk if it's still too much because i've been to many NFL games and I know thats a day trip, same goes for Disney World.

What I expect from Florida/want to see

Well i know it's not the best time of the year to travel to Florida so we may have to adjust but that can happen everywhere in the world.

I want to see the aligators, the palm trees, turtles, dolphins, do some snorkeling, swimming, 

I can still cancel the hotels and adjust the plan if needed to. Not sure about the plans in Homestead and Tampa.",2024-07-16 05:54:38
2112,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, happy",An Open Letter to Spring Breakers. Come to Iceland. It's Wilder.,"# An Open Letter to Every Drunk Spring Breaker in Miami

By an Iceland-ish Friend

Dear Drunk College Students,

Going to Florida for one wild and crazy week a year makes sense. It is a very pretty place, with its palm trees and beaches and elderly population. You can eat breakfast at any time of the day and sometimes alligators cross the road. 

Do you know what crosses the road in Iceland my dear drunk friends? WILD HORSES and RAINBOWS. I don’t want to be a soggy beach blanket but perhaps it’s time to consider a more exotic destination for Spring Break, somewhere you can really go wild. Iceland baby!

You want to drink until you blackout and wake up with a strange sexy person in a mysterious and sexy place? We do that all the time but we drink Brennivin while lounging nuuude in geothermal jacuzzis and later, after we make love to an attractive person who we have verified we are not related to, we sometimes wake up under the Northern Lights. Vape that, Miami. 

One time, my cousin got me so drunk I browned out, I think that’s what you call it, and I came to on top of an active volcano. And let me tell you, there’s no cure for a hangover like running for your life from red hot lava, if you get my flow, my lava flow?

Doesn’t our country sound like an enchanting place? We don’t even need drugs here because we believe in fairies and frost giants and are home to dozens of rainbows each day. But wait, there’s more! We have ice diamond beaches, geysers, glaciers, the majestic Vestrahorn Mountains, puffin colonies, waterfalls, fermented shark, more waterfalls, Björk, and Black Death drink.

Ok ok, so your friends will all be in Flooorida or something. But according to my readings, Florida is sinking! Dearest drunks, it’s sliding into the ocean. What will happen to you if you’re dancing nudey groovy and suddenly dolphins swim by? Americans are very special but I’m pretty sure you don’t have gills. This is not the Little Mermaid. Stingrays and dolphins will be happy partying in your abandoned underwater South Beach dance clubs while you search for a new submarine condo.

I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to be negative. I take that back. Let’s start over ok? No more end of times talk. 

Don’t you spend enough time with your Spring Break friends already? Aren’t you a teensy weensy bit curious to explore our fascinating Icelandic gene pool? Everyone here is good looking, friendly, and extremely strong. It’s really great! 

If we were a little genetically more diverse I wouldn’t even be writing you this letter. See dear drunks, we have a little problem. Well it’s not a problem so much as it is an annoyance. We are a small country right? Very charming, no? Well, when you’re small, you have a lot more cousins than you think - almost all of us are at least a little bit related. Some smartypants even built an app to help us avoid smooches in the family tree, thanks be to Freyja.

But what would be really super cool would be if you would bring like, a whole lot of sexy American people to Iceland for Spring Break. Maybe you’ll like it and want to stay or we can all fall in love or you know, something. 

So please forget about Miami and Cancun and that beach in Texas and come Spring Break in Iceland. 

P.S. Don’t forget your sunscreen, rain poncho, wool socks, and party pants! See you soon!

I keep my central AC at 73°. And my unit can mostly keep up and keep my home at around 76° during hot days. But yesterday was very hot. And my homes temperature were at 80°. Last year I experienced similar temps during the hottest days of the year in September. But seeing how we're in May and already experiencing super hot days. I figured I need to do something about this.

Anyways my central AC unit has no issues. It's a few years old. Filters are clean. Indoor and outdoor condenser and radiators are clean. Its my mistake for not ordering a larger unit knowing how summers get here in Florida. 

A new central unit is very expensive. Rather than spend several thousands of dollars to replace mine. I was thinking I can install a window unit to help my central AC cool my home more quickly. — at least as a temporary solution as I set aside funds to eventually replace the central AC unit.

For anyone that currently has a similar setup.

Edited: I specifically put the comment about DeSantis to keep people from making this political.

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60’s?) single pane windows. I’m still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7° temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, “ewww. 80s? You lizard. 🦎“ ... Lol, the room is around 78° and is a completely uninsulated 1970’s porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I’m thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

Obviously going into October would be better, but also more expensive. I've been towards the end of November before, but due to costs September is currently the best option.

I live in the UK and today is 30°c. Which is very hot for us. But we also don't have ac at home. A couple of years ago it reached 40 here and it was unbearable.

Thanks everyone for the info, I think we'll be avoiding September now even if it's significantly cheaper. I don't want us to overheat and the chance of storms doesn't sound very fun.

My mindset has changed to where us wanting them the fuck out is a take that’s just fine, as we are also allowed to act in our self interests.

I read all your comments and now I pretty much fully agree with the sentiment here. I officially moved back on the 21st of December so; hell I’m still adjusting. However I lived here for the preceding 33 years of my life(currently 37). The only shock is how the people changed.

But today I was walking around the Tampa burbs at the store and someone legit said “wow it’s hot outside compared to New Jersey” and I’m like “my brother in Christ, you will not survive”.

Old cell phones can still used for dialing 911. Charge external battery backups. ( Glow sticks also provide light for a few hours. Stand them upright in a glass or jar to make a lantern.)
2. Wash all trash cans, big and small, and fill them with water for flushing toilets. Line outdoor trash cans with trash bags, fill them with water and store them in the garage. Add bleach to sterilize. 
3. Fill every tub and sink with water. Cover sinks with Saran Wrap to keep it from collecting dust. Fill the washing machine and leave the lid up to store water.
4. Fill old empty water bottles and other containers with water and keep them near sinks for washing hands. 
5. Fill every Tupperware with water and store it in the freezer. These will help keep food cold longer and serve as a backup water supply. 
6. Fill drinking cups with water and cover with Saran Wrap. Store as many as possible in the fridge. You can store the rest on the counter and use it before opening any water bottles. Ice is impossible to find after the storm.
7. Reserve fridge space for storing tap water and keep the sealed water bottles on the counter. 
8. Cook any meats in advance and other perishable foods. You can freeze cooked food. Hard boil eggs for snacks for the first day without power. 
9. Be well hydrated before the storm hits and avoid salty foods that make you dehydrated. 
10. Wash all dirty clothes and bed sheets. Anything dirty will smell without the A/C, you may need the items, and with no A/C, you'll be sweating a lot. You're going to want clean sheets. 
11. Toss out any expired food, clean cat litter boxes, and empty all trash cans in the house, including bathrooms. Remove anything that will cause an odor when the A/C is off. If you don't have a trash day pickup before the storm, find a dumpster. 
12. Bring in any yard decor, secure anything that will fly around, secure gates, bring in hoses, potted plants, etc. Bring in patio furniture and grills. 
13. Clean your environment so you have clear, easy escape routes. Even if that means temporarily moving furniture to one area. 
14. Scrub all bathrooms so you are starting with a clean odor-free environment. Store water-filled trash cans next to each toilet for flushing. 
15. Place everything you own that is important and necessary in a backpack or small file box that is easy to grab. Include your wallet with ID, phone, hand sanitizer, snacks, etc. Get plastic sleeves for important documents.
16. Make sure you have cash on hand.
17. Stock up on pet food and fill up bowls of water for pets. 
18. Refill any medications. Most insurance companies allow for 2 emergency refills per year.
19. Fill your propane tanks. You can heat soup cans, boil water, make coffee, and other stuff besides just grilling meat. Get an extra, if possible.
20. Drop your A/C in advance and lower temperatures in your fridges. 
21. Gather all candles, flashlights, lighters, matches, batteries, and other items and keep them accessible. 
22. Clean all counters in advance. Start with a clean surface. Buy Clorox Wipes for cleaning when there is no power. Mop your floors and vacuum. If power is out for 10 days, you'll have to live in the mess you started with. 
23. Pick your emergency safe place such as a closet under the stairs. Store the items you'll need in that location for the brunt of the storm. Make a hand fan for when the power is out. 
24. Shower just before the storm is scheduled to hit. 
25. Keep baby wipes next to each toilet. Don't flush them. It's not the time to risk clogging your toilet!
26. Run your dishwasher, don't risk having dirty smelly dishes and you need every container for water! Remember you'll need clean water for brushing your teeth, washing yourself, and cleaning your hands. 
27. Put a small suitcase in your car in case you decide to evacuate. Also, put at least one jug of water in your car. It will still be there if you don't evacuate!  Remember to pack for pets as well. 
28. Check on all family members, set up emergency backup plans, and check on elderly neighbors. 
29. Remember, pets are family too. Take them with you!
30. Before the storm, unplug all electronics. There will be power surges during and after the storm.
31. Gas up your car and have a spare gas container for your generator or your car when you run out.
32 . Use plastic cups and paper plates. 👍  You need water to wash dishes....👎
33 . Also if you run out of water tap your hot water heater it can have up to 30 gallons stored in there.
34 . Put water in balloons and store it in the freezer.
35 . If it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown Flush it down!💩
If you can, take a video of your house and contents....walk room to room--open cabinets/drawers and closets.  This will help if you need to make a claim later.  It will show proof of items and help you list all the items (help your memory, so you don't forget anything)...I highly recommend it!!!
I also heard you should freeze a cup of water, and place a coin on top after it is frozen...keep this in your freezer to help you gauge the temperature if the power goes out.  If the coin stays on top, the food is staying frozen.  If the coin falls into the water, the freezer thawed out and most food will likely need to be thrown away.  This is super helpful is you have to leave and come back, as it may appear everything is still frozen, but if the coin is in the cup--you will know!!",2024-10-09 14:45:24

We do that all the time but we drink Brennivin while lounging nuuude in geothermal jacuzzis and later, after we make love to an attractive person who we have verified we are not related to, we sometimes wake up under the Northern Lights. Vape that, Miami. 

One time, my cousin got me so drunk I browned out, I think that’s what you call it, and I came to on top of an active volcano. And let me tell you, there’s no cure for a hangover like running for your life from red hot lava, if you get my flow, my lava flow?

Doesn’t our country sound like an enchanting place? We don’t even need drugs here because we believe in fairies and frost giants and are home to dozens of rainbows each day. But wait, there’s more! We have ice diamond beaches, geysers, glaciers, the majestic Vestrahorn Mountains, puffin colonies, waterfalls, fermented shark, more waterfalls, Björk, and Black Death drink.

Ok ok, so your friends will all be in Flooorida or something. But according to my readings, Florida is sinking! Dearest drunks, it’s sliding into the ocean. What will happen to you if you’re dancing nudey groovy and suddenly dolphins swim by? Americans are very special but I’m pretty sure you don’t have gills. This is not the Little Mermaid. Stingrays and dolphins will be happy partying in your abandoned underwater South Beach dance clubs while you search for a new submarine condo.

I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to be negative. I take that back. Let’s start over ok? No more end of times talk. 

Don’t you spend enough time with your Spring Break friends already? Aren’t you a teensy weensy bit curious to explore our fascinating Icelandic gene pool? Everyone here is good looking, friendly, and extremely strong. It’s really great! 

If we were a little genetically more diverse I wouldn’t even be writing you this letter. See dear drunks, we have a little problem. Well it’s not a problem so much as it is an annoyance. We are a small country right? Very charming, no? Well, when you’re small, you have a lot more cousins than you think - almost all of us are at least a little bit related. Some smartypants even built an app to help us avoid smooches in the family tree, thanks be to Freyja.

But what would be really super cool would be if you would bring like, a whole lot of sexy American people to Iceland for Spring Break. Maybe you’ll like it and want to stay or we can all fall in love or you know, something. 

So please forget about Miami and Cancun and that beach in Texas and come Spring Break in Iceland. 

P.S. Don’t forget your sunscreen, rain poncho, wool socks, and party pants! See you soon!

\- Your Iceland-ish Friend

My question is: Are there any good, safe, family oriented communities around the Tampa, Sarasota, Orlando-ish areas. Less populated would be preferable. If the area is also quite walkable that would be a plus. Though my number one priority is safety and low crime.

2140,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, comfortable",Heat film - effective heat reduction on old windows,"For those of us where replacing windows simply isn’t an option financially, or logistically, or because you’re a renter, just wanted to share a small success story on heat film.

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60’s?) single pane windows. I’m still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7° temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, “ewww. 80s? You lizard. 🦎“ ... Lol, the room is around 78° and is a completely uninsulated 1970’s porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I’m thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

Recently, despite our A/C being set to 71 it constantly hovers at 73-74 and never actually gets down to 71. We have tried to get Duke/our landlord to look into what is going on, but they act like it’s normal.

Edited: I specifically put the comment about DeSantis to keep people from making this political. Regardless of who you voted for and what you think they did to Florida Utilities, that doesn’t explain our kWh going up since last July or our unit never being able to cool to the set temperature or our unit feeling hot even when at 73.

Obviously going into October would be better, but also more expensive. I've been towards the end of November before, but due to costs September is currently the best option.

I live in the UK and today is 30°c. Which is very hot for us. But we also don't have ac at home. A couple of years ago it reached 40 here and it was unbearable.

Thanks everyone for the info, I think we'll be avoiding September now even if it's significantly cheaper. I don't want us to overheat and the chance of storms doesn't sound very fun.

2152,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, comfortable",Hurricane Prep List.,"1. Charge any device that provides light. Laptops, tablets, cameras, video cameras, and old phones. Old cell phones can still used for dialing 911. Charge external battery backups. ( Glow sticks also provide light for a few hours. Stand them upright in a glass or jar to make a lantern.)
2. Wash all trash cans, big and small, and fill them with water for flushing toilets. Line outdoor trash cans with trash bags, fill them with water and store them in the garage. Add bleach to sterilize. 
3. Fill every tub and sink with water. Cover sinks with Saran Wrap to keep it from collecting dust. Fill the washing machine and leave the lid up to store water.
4. Fill old empty water bottles and other containers with water and keep them near sinks for washing hands. 
5. Fill every Tupperware with water and store it in the freezer. These will help keep food cold longer and serve as a backup water supply. 
6. Fill drinking cups with water and cover with Saran Wrap. Store as many as possible in the fridge. You can store the rest on the counter and use it before opening any water bottles. Ice is impossible to find after the storm.
7. Reserve fridge space for storing tap water and keep the sealed water bottles on the counter. 
8. Cook any meats in advance and other perishable foods. You can freeze cooked food. Hard boil eggs for snacks for the first day without power. 
9. Be well hydrated before the storm hits and avoid salty foods that make you dehydrated. 
10. Wash all dirty clothes and bed sheets. Anything dirty will smell without the A/C, you may need the items, and with no A/C, you'll be sweating a lot. You're going to want clean sheets. 
11. Toss out any expired food, clean cat litter boxes, and empty all trash cans in the house, including bathrooms. Remove anything that will cause an odor when the A/C is off. If you don't have a trash day pickup before the storm, find a dumpster. 
12. Bring in any yard decor, secure anything that will fly around, secure gates, bring in hoses, potted plants, etc. Bring in patio furniture and grills. 
13. Clean your environment so you have clear, easy escape routes. Even if that means temporarily moving furniture to one area. 
14. Scrub all bathrooms so you are starting with a clean odor-free environment. Store water-filled trash cans next to each toilet for flushing. 
15. Place everything you own that is important and necessary in a backpack or small file box that is easy to grab. Include your wallet with ID, phone, hand sanitizer, snacks, etc. Get plastic sleeves for important documents.
16. Make sure you have cash on hand.
17. Stock up on pet food and fill up bowls of water for pets. 
18. Refill any medications. Most insurance companies allow for 2 emergency refills per year.
19. Fill your propane tanks. You can heat soup cans, boil water, make coffee, and other stuff besides just grilling meat. Get an extra, if possible.
20. Drop your A/C in advance and lower temperatures in your fridges. 
21. Gather all candles, flashlights, lighters, matches, batteries, and other items and keep them accessible. 
22. Clean all counters in advance. Start with a clean surface. Buy Clorox Wipes for cleaning when there is no power. Mop your floors and vacuum. If power is out for 10 days, you'll have to live in the mess you started with. 
23. Pick your emergency safe place such as a closet under the stairs. Store the items you'll need in that location for the brunt of the storm. Make a hand fan for when the power is out. 
24. Shower just before the storm is scheduled to hit. 
25. Keep baby wipes next to each toilet. Don't flush them. It's not the time to risk clogging your toilet!
26. Run your dishwasher, don't risk having dirty smelly dishes and you need every container for water! Remember you'll need clean water for brushing your teeth, washing yourself, and cleaning your hands. 
27. Put a small suitcase in your car in case you decide to evacuate. Also, put at least one jug of water in your car. It will still be there if you don't evacuate!  Remember to pack for pets as well. 
28. Check on all family members, set up emergency backup plans, and check on elderly neighbors. 
29. Remember, pets are family too. Take them with you!
30. Before the storm, unplug all electronics. There will be power surges during and after the storm.
31. Gas up your car and have a spare gas container for your generator or your car when you run out.
32 . Use plastic cups and paper plates. 👍  You need water to wash dishes....👎
33 . Also if you run out of water tap your hot water heater it can have up to 30 gallons stored in there.
34 . Put water in balloons and store it in the freezer.
35 . If it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown Flush it down!💩
If you can, take a video of your house and contents....walk room to room--open cabinets/drawers and closets.  This will help if you need to make a claim later.  It will show proof of items and help you list all the items (help your memory, so you don't forget anything)...I highly recommend it!!!
I also heard you should freeze a cup of water, and place a coin on top after it is frozen...keep this in your freezer to help you gauge the temperature if the power goes out.  If the coin stays on top, the food is staying frozen.  If the coin falls into the water, the freezer thawed out and most food will likely need to be thrown away.  This is super helpful is you have to leave and come back, as it may appear everything is still frozen, but if the coin is in the cup--you will know!!",2024-10-09 14:45:24

1. The stairs leading up to the second floor rooms are shaky and you have to use the handrails to not fall.  However, the handrails have broken and chipped paint that hurt your hands and are rusting.  Even the property manager told us she doesn't like going up and down those stairs.

2.  The drain in the hot tub looks like it spent the last 20 years under water on a ship wreck.  It was so rusted, we did not feel comfortable using it.

3.  The swimming pool and the heated mineral pool were filthy.  We actually used the skimmer to try to clean the mineral pool ourselves, but once we got in, we saw all the scum on the tiles and quickly got out.

4.  The towels were stained and had large rips.

5.  The wifi and TV service never worked the entire time we were there.

6.  Our plans changed and we needed to leave a day early.  I talked to the property manager and she said she would change the reservation and refund us what we had paid for the last night of the stay that we wouldn't be using.  We left by 10am that morning so they had plenty of time to clean the room and prepare it for someone else.  It turned out that she lied and never gave us the refund.  When we complained afterwards through Expedia's customer service, they tried contacting the property but could not get approval for the refund so we ended up paying over $300 for a night in a room we didn't use even after being assured that wouldn't happen.

7.  The nice and quiet atmosphere is now ruined by a bar that is directly adjacent to the property.  Our room was on the opposite side of the property but we still could hear the customers and the music through the walls until after 2am each night.

8.  One of the ""features"" they mention is that you are within view of the historical Flagler Beach pier.  They don't mention it was badly damaged in a storm over 2 years ago and has not been repaired and is just boarded up.  The last section of it looks like it will fall into the ocean anytime now.

9.  One of the two mornings we were there, we came down for breakfast and were told that the cook just didn't show up that day so our bed and breakfast had no breakfast but no compensation was offered for this.10.  The waitress was telling us private stuff about other staff members like a cracked skull during a fight with her boyfriend.  That isn't the story you want to hear on your romantic anniversary trip and should have been told to the police instead or out of town customers.

Overall, this place is poorly managed, not maintained and way overpriced for what you are getting.  I highly recommend avoiding it and if you have reservations already, cancel them and then monitor your credit card to make sure they don't charge you anyway.",2024-04-12 13:42:02

In the next 4 years my family and I are interested in moving to Florida for our daughter's college interests. The idea is a little worrisome due to quite a big change in weather and temperatures from Maryland to Florida. But we are an ex-military family and have lived in some hot places in the past. And I have been in my fair share of hurricanes so with any luck it'll be fine.

My question is: Are there any good, safe, family oriented communities around the Tampa, Sarasota, Orlando-ish areas. Less populated would be preferable. If the area is also quite walkable that would be a plus. Though my number one priority is safety and low crime.

Thank you in advance for any and all information.",2023-03-02 13:53:32

I do not care about power outages it is irrelevant. It's back on in a few days or a few hours. Most people fear power outages in Florida due to the extreme temperatures and the inability to find air conditioning in such an occasion. So you are aware the Florida born and raised can wear black sweater and a hoodie outside as I do this everyday. I wore the black hoodie to keep the sunlight off me. Even when I worked outside doing manual labor I kept a sweater on me. At lunch time when you take it off everything feels frigid like you just walked into a 73° house. This all comes from personal experience. If you're not seasoned for heat then you probably shouldn't be in Florida. It takes time for your body to be acclimated to the harsh climate here. What most people would consider suffering humidity we as Floridians don't really even notice it most of the time. Because when you're born in it, that just makes it business as usual. I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone. Democracy dies in the state. Heat makes people only care about what's actually important. So if you're from up North welcome to the Republic.

I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

There's so much to do! South Florida has so much access, to the Keys, Everglades, 2 major cruise ports, 3 large airports, amazing beaches, food, I could go on...

All the nature and world class beaches really are just so amazing. FTL really has great access to beaches. And while I know the iguanas are invasive, I love lizards and found them fascinating.

I loved seeing our state come together when the developments were proposed in our state parks. It was very inspiring and I hope that we can continue to bring that energy to preserve the beauty of this place we call home.

Personally, I am very passionate about our springs here in Florida. I grew up in Levy County, and pretty much all of my memories of summer revolved around visiting our springs. I'm in my mid-40s now and live in Orlando but still love visiting the springs and marveling at their beauty. Sadly, I am also old enough to be able to see how they have changed since I was a kid which is why I'm posting today.

The DEP has refused to follow the law for over 8 years by not creating plans to manage and mitigate pollution that ends up in our springs in Florida. As many of us are aware, certain industries have bought and paid for our politicians and I suspect this is largely why the DEP have dragged their feet so much when it comes to springs protection. Part of this protection they are supposed to be giving relates to the regulation of harmful water withdrawals that they are refusing to regulate by the law. DEP is on their same bs.

There is a period of public comment happening right now, ending on October 17, regarding this ongoing failure of the DEP. Much like the state parks issue, a non-profit has made it simple for folks to contact DEP and let them know how they feel about their inaction. You can do so at the link in the comments.

The Florida Springs Council does amazing work and I am proud to be a sustaining member toward their advocacy of our springs and other environmental issues in Florida.

Our neighbor has a wooden fence that is falling over so the dogs are always out. There is now 8 dogs in our yard and neighbors everyday. 

Trash is all over the yards and road, we found random chewed up shoes in our yard.

 They got a hold of my toddlers pool and shredded it. They provoke out dog when we have him outside with us causing fights. 

I was unloading groceries a few days ago from our car, one jumped in grabbing a loaf of bread and running off with it. The dogs are obviously starving and not taken care of.

All of them are friendly except two who stay back barking. But they get into fights with each other over attention when they start jumping on you. I have a toddler and it's at the ppoint I can't take her outside to play or even walk to the car without them jumping on us and knocking her over. I'm afraid they will bite her Fighting with each other too.

They bark and carry on all during the night waking us and my toddler. Because of this her sleep schedule is all messed up.

It's summer and I feel imprisoned in my own home. I've called animal control everyday about this and nothing has been done. They said today they sent someone out and seen no dogs. I find it hard to believe since I see them all day everyday.

I'm at my wits end. My husband wants to shoot them but I love animals and know they are just hungry and not cared for. we have talked to the neighbor and owner but he doesn't care. Says dogs are dogs.

What other options do I have here. This has been an issue now for 2 years and I'm afraid the mom is pregnant again as we saw her matin with a male a few days ago.",2024-05-29 18:42:33

We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01

2209,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, love",Could the AC tech have caused this surge in our electricity bill?,"On August 4th, 2023, an AC tech came out to our apartment to fix a leak in one of our split units. Immediately after his visit, our energy usage readings started to increase substantially. After noticing the surge a few days later, we decided to increase our indoor temp from 70 degrees to 74 to offset the additional usage. Despite that, when our bill came out three weeks later, our bill was $60 more than the previous month. Our bill comparison pulled directly from FPL shows that the average outside temp was the same for the previous and current month but our bill still increased. 

Before anyone suggests that it increased because our temp was set to so low, I’d like to clarify that our AC was at 70-71 degrees for the previous two months where we paid $109-$115 for each one despite the summer heat. This time our bill was $171 and FPL identified the average outside temp as the same for BOTH months (previous and current). In the daily usage report, there’s a clear spike the day of/after the tech visit on August 4th that maintains throughout the rest of the period. After sharing this with management, they had an electrician come out, but all he did was turn the AC temperature down to 65 while he took readings from the circuit box before leaving since he was not able to communicate with us in English. Is it possible that this was caused by the AC tech when he visited on August 4th? What should my next steps be? I don’t want to continue paying more for electricity if unnecessary but management continues to blame it on the summer heat and raised FPL rates which I'm almost certain happened before July. We only have a 1bd apartment with no children. Just my bf and I.

I keep my central AC at 73°. And my unit can mostly keep up and keep my home at around 76° during hot days. But yesterday was very hot. And my homes temperature were at 80°. Last year I experienced similar temps during the hottest days of the year in September. But seeing how we're in May and already experiencing super hot days. I figured I need to do something about this.

Anyways my central AC unit has no issues. It's a few years old. Filters are clean. Indoor and outdoor condenser and radiators are clean. Its my mistake for not ordering a larger unit knowing how summers get here in Florida. 

A new central unit is very expensive. Rather than spend several thousands of dollars to replace mine. I was thinking I can install a window unit to help my central AC cool my home more quickly. — at least as a temporary solution as I set aside funds to eventually replace the central AC unit.

For anyone that currently has a similar setup.

I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them?

2232,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, hate",Why does everyone seem so upset on this sub?,"for context, I lived most of my life in NC, a few years in SC and GA.

I (22M) stayed in the beautiful city of Melbourne last year for 3 months for a summer engineering internship, and by the end, I wanted to move there

Im finishing 3 months this year in Silicon Valley for another internship.

I have to know, what is with all the hatred on this sub? Some of the common points I see when people are hating on Fl are 1) cost of living, 2) weather, 3) insurance companies leaving.

.....do you people realize all these things are like 10x worse in California?

cost of living, forget about it, insurance, forget about it, weather? how many years have these wildfires been happening?

For christs sake, you people have NO INCOME TAX!!!! Only a handful of states in the US have this privilege, and florida is the only one with good beaches. No income tax, wonderful destinations, plenty of jobs, yall have alot to be grateful for.  Id KILL for no income tax, thats literally a gift from god. Most people have to fight tooth and nail to evade taxes, but your government just hands it to you on a silver platter. Ive lived in florida, and ive lived in the sapphire blue toilet bowl on the other side of the country, trust me, Id take FL any day.

Im not trying to paint this as a left or right thing, I identify as socially left and economically right, so I am  not taking a side here. but seriously yall need to appreciate what you have that us in other states (CA, NC,SC) dont have at all.

I understand some of yall dont like desantis and dont like his social policy, fair enough (although that new alimony law should have won some of you socially left people over, alimony is a patriarchal construct in the first place)

but come on, what NON-SOCIAL (I repeat, NON-SOCIAL) policies do you have or not have in florida that you think california does better? as someone whos lived in both, Im genuinely curious

Not just that it's cool, but I live for being able to leave my windows open.  Even when it's cold I have them cracked.  But then the temps begin to edge up and suddenly highs are in the upper 80s.  Then it's time to batten down the hatches, knowing that I won't be able to open my windows for at least another 7 months, until after Halloween or later.  

I don't hate the summer and I love Florida all year round.  But I especially love the cool air -- being able to smell flowers, listen to birds without the sound of the A/C, smell the rain, have a fresh breeze blowing thru.

In this part of florida being above 95 degrees is common in the summer. The female is often in a wire crate because she jumps the fence and escapes daily. The only reason she isn't left in this crate for days at a time is she escapes. Whenever she escapes she comes to our front door and will often get into our backyard and try to kill our chickens, or try to force herself in through our front door. We do not feed her or let her in our house ever, but she consistently comes back.

I feel bad for them, but can anything actually be done. The crate has water and there is shade in the backyard. They are left our regarless of the rainstorms (even tornado warnings) or heat. Whenever they get out the neighbors apologize and say they'll ""handle it"" but these conditions are inhumane, and it's putting our pets lives at risk everytime she jumps into our backyard.

Thanks everyone for the info, I think we'll be avoiding September now even if it's significantly cheaper. I don't want us to overheat and the chance of storms doesn't sound very fun.

2241,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06

I’m 37 and I live with my parents. I make 67,000 a year and cannot afford my own place, I SHOULD HATE transplants according to y’all’s, but guess what? I don’t. You know why? Because that’s the name of the game, that’s right.

Florida is essentially developed swampland, sure but Florida has a desirable climate, low taxes, and lots of corporations are moving here. Home prices here have gone up FASTER than the average ever since the invention of home air conditioning, florida has always had more inflow for most of y’all’s lives, for a reason.

I own a cabin in Anchorage AK, I bought it to fish, and avoid paying taxes on a work bonus. I’d kill myself if I had to live there. Believe it or not, but most people don’t like the cold. Most of the land area in the US gets pretty cold(below freezing lows for at least 1/3 of the year) and people are free to spend their money and move wherever they want.

Supply and demand forces are at play, many of us who are not homeowners may never own a home here, it sucks BIG, but that’s how it works. Same shit happened in Hawaii, bulldozed native homes to build ostentatious beachfront homes, LA, San Diego, Phoenix, Arizona, you think you’re special?. That’s just the name of game, jit. That’s how capitalism works. Prices don’t go up because it sucks living here. The brutal winters in NYC sucked asshole. The summer “nights” at the cabin suck asshole.

Every place with a appealing climate is gonna get rocked with not affordable CoL, that’s how it works, that’s how it has worked and it’s how it will always work.

Don’t have a gripe because people want to live in a nicer place, with nicer weather, with nicer tax treatment. That’s petty, makes you look childish.

If you’re dead set on hating someone because you’ll never own a home here, hate Airbnb, OpenDoor, and Zillow, don’t hate people because they see an opportunity to live a better life, fuck that.

Immediately after his visit, our energy usage readings started to increase substantially. After noticing the surge a few days later, we decided to increase our indoor temp from 70 degrees to 74 to offset the additional usage. Despite that, when our bill came out three weeks later, our bill was $60 more than the previous month. Our bill comparison pulled directly from FPL shows that the average outside temp was the same for the previous and current month but our bill still increased. 

Before anyone suggests that it increased because our temp was set to so low, I’d like to clarify that our AC was at 70-71 degrees for the previous two months where we paid $109-$115 for each one despite the summer heat. This time our bill was $171 and FPL identified the average outside temp as the same for BOTH months (previous and current). In the daily usage report, there’s a clear spike the day of/after the tech visit on August 4th that maintains throughout the rest of the period. After sharing this with management, they had an electrician come out, but all he did was turn the AC temperature down to 65 while he took readings from the circuit box before leaving since he was not able to communicate with us in English. Is it possible that this was caused by the AC tech when he visited on August 4th? What should my next steps be? I don’t want to continue paying more for electricity if unnecessary but management continues to blame it on the summer heat and raised FPL rates which I'm almost certain happened before July. We only have a 1bd apartment with no children. Just my bf and I.

I keep my central AC at 73°. And my unit can mostly keep up and keep my home at around 76° during hot days. But yesterday was very hot. And my homes temperature were at 80°. Last year I experienced similar temps during the hottest days of the year in September. But seeing how we're in May and already experiencing super hot days. I figured I need to do something about this.

Anyways my central AC unit has no issues. It's a few years old. Filters are clean. Indoor and outdoor condenser and radiators are clean. Its my mistake for not ordering a larger unit knowing how summers get here in Florida. 

A new central unit is very expensive. Rather than spend several thousands of dollars to replace mine. I was thinking I can install a window unit to help my central AC cool my home more quickly. — at least as a temporary solution as I set aside funds to eventually replace the central AC unit.

I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon.

A lot of times I end up staying inside all day, paralyzed by trying to make the decision to go out while also trying to plan for all that would entail. A lot of the things I would prefer to do indoors tend to be out of budget for me - things like going to the movies or out to eat or shopping at the mall. I end up feeling guilty because I should be grateful that I get to live in this great state but am not taking advantage of all it has to offer during these months.

So if anyone has tips they use. to get through this time of year I would love to hear what everyone else does!",2024-06-30 14:30:57

I’m quite pale. Always have been. I can stay out in the sun in my home state for hours with no sunscreen, and stay the same shade of paper white without ever burning. But I was up the smoky mountains last summer and got a bad sunburn there in like 2 hours of mountain sun, so apparently it’s possible in different climates. Florida is, uhhh, gonna test me….and the last thing I want is a sunburn ruining my vacation. I don’t care about getting tan and would prefer to keep my skin tone, although I know that’s probably wishful thinking.  

things I am already considering:

-the highest spf I can find and applying it every 2 hours. I’d like product recommendations for this, especially for the face that I could potentially wear under light makeup, without breaking me out horribly.

- a wide brim sun hat. Maybe something like a rash guard/swim shirt?

- maybe trying to go tanning and see if I can get a bit of a base tan. I don’t really want to do this, but will if I have to. Would that even help? 

Please help this pasty pale person be able to enjoy Florida!


***edit, post vacation: if anyone find this post later and wants to know what worked, I used la roche posay 60 SPF sunscreen, one made for the body and a dry touch one for face,  and reapplied every 4 hours, wore a sun hat sometimes, and got a very lightweight SPF zip up jacket that i wore once on the warmest day when I could feel the sun starting to get bad. I successfully did not get sunburnt! I got a little bit of a tan but no significant burn (other than a spot I missed on my nose one day), and spent pretty much the whole week outside. So there is hope for us pasty pale people! Also they weren’t kidding about needing sunglasses- thank god I ordered some prescription ones beforehand, if you need similar DO IT.

Immediately after his visit, our energy usage readings started to increase substantially. After noticing the surge a few days later, we decided to increase our indoor temp from 70 degrees to 74 to offset the additional usage. Despite that, when our bill came out three weeks later, our bill was $60 more than the previous month. Our bill comparison pulled directly from FPL shows that the average outside temp was the same for the previous and current month but our bill still increased. 

Before anyone suggests that it increased because our temp was set to so low, I’d like to clarify that our AC was at 70-71 degrees for the previous two months where we paid $109-$115 for each one despite the summer heat. This time our bill was $171 and FPL identified the average outside temp as the same for BOTH months (previous and current). In the daily usage report, there’s a clear spike the day of/after the tech visit on August 4th that maintains throughout the rest of the period. After sharing this with management, they had an electrician come out, but all he did was turn the AC temperature down to 65 while he took readings from the circuit box before leaving since he was not able to communicate with us in English. Is it possible that this was caused by the AC tech when he visited on August 4th? What should my next steps be? I don’t want to continue paying more for electricity if unnecessary but management continues to blame it on the summer heat and raised FPL rates which I'm almost certain happened before July. We only have a 1bd apartment with no children. Just my bf and I.

I keep my central AC at 73°. And my unit can mostly keep up and keep my home at around 76° during hot days. But yesterday was very hot. And my homes temperature were at 80°. Last year I experienced similar temps during the hottest days of the year in September. But seeing how we're in May and already experiencing super hot days. I figured I need to do something about this.

Anyways my central AC unit has no issues. It's a few years old. Filters are clean. Indoor and outdoor condenser and radiators are clean. Its my mistake for not ordering a larger unit knowing how summers get here in Florida. 

A new central unit is very expensive. Rather than spend several thousands of dollars to replace mine. I was thinking I can install a window unit to help my central AC cool my home more quickly. — at least as a temporary solution as I set aside funds to eventually replace the central AC unit.

For anyone that currently has a similar setup.

My fiancé and I are getting married in September, and he really really really wants to honeymoon in Florida. Originally we were going to do Vegas, but we are going there in October for a concert anyway, so he doesn’t wanna “double dip” and wants to go somewhere different. 

I’ve never been outside of the western half of the United States other than Germany, and am very used to mountains and alligator free lakes, and I’ve never seen the ocean. But the part I’m worried about the most is the HUMIDITY and wet heat. My state (Montana) is dry heat. So it’s usually more manageable. 

I am a *large* woman and the whitest of white without being a redhead, so I’m concerned about getting swamp ass (that I already get here in the summer) and being miserable the whole trip. 

And though I am excited about seeing the ocean, I’m also terrified of it and probably wouldn’t want to go more than ankle deep because of sharks lol. (I bet I would look like a real nice fat seal) though my fiancé says he’s gonna convince me lol. 

I’m just wondering where in the state is the prettiest as far as beaches go, but also not completely PACKED with people? And what time of year would be best to go to avoid crazy heat and tons of people? We may not honeymoon directly after the wedding, we may wait till after the new year. I’m aware it’s Florida and it’s gonna be busy either way, but I would love to be able to enjoy the beach and stuff without 1000 other people the same day lol. 

Also what kind of tourist stuff would be recommended? Because of my size, I probably wouldn’t fit on a lot of the rides at Disney, so unsure about going there. 

Would you recommend to stay at a resort or a hotel? What should I avoid? Please just give me a good rundown so I can hopefully actually enjoy my time. We will be going for somewhere between 5-7 days.

When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

Immediately after his visit, our energy usage readings started to increase substantially. After noticing the surge a few days later, we decided to increase our indoor temp from 70 degrees to 74 to offset the additional usage. Despite that, when our bill came out three weeks later, our bill was $60 more than the previous month. Our bill comparison pulled directly from FPL shows that the average outside temp was the same for the previous and current month but our bill still increased. 

Before anyone suggests that it increased because our temp was set to so low, I’d like to clarify that our AC was at 70-71 degrees for the previous two months where we paid $109-$115 for each one despite the summer heat. This time our bill was $171 and FPL identified the average outside temp as the same for BOTH months (previous and current). In the daily usage report, there’s a clear spike the day of/after the tech visit on August 4th that maintains throughout the rest of the period. After sharing this with management, they had an electrician come out, but all he did was turn the AC temperature down to 65 while he took readings from the circuit box before leaving since he was not able to communicate with us in English. Is it possible that this was caused by the AC tech when he visited on August 4th? What should my next steps be? I don’t want to continue paying more for electricity if unnecessary but management continues to blame it on the summer heat and raised FPL rates which I'm almost certain happened before July. We only have a 1bd apartment with no children. Just my bf and I.

I keep my central AC at 73°. And my unit can mostly keep up and keep my home at around 76° during hot days. But yesterday was very hot. And my homes temperature were at 80°. Last year I experienced similar temps during the hottest days of the year in September. But seeing how we're in May and already experiencing super hot days. I figured I need to do something about this.

Anyways my central AC unit has no issues. It's a few years old. Filters are clean. Indoor and outdoor condenser and radiators are clean. Its my mistake for not ordering a larger unit knowing how summers get here in Florida. 

A new central unit is very expensive. Rather than spend several thousands of dollars to replace mine. I was thinking I can install a window unit to help my central AC cool my home more quickly. — at least as a temporary solution as I set aside funds to eventually replace the central AC unit.

2338,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, happy",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

our insurance company says a minimum level must be maintained while we’re away.

2349,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, happy",Could the AC tech have caused this surge in our electricity bill?,"On August 4th, 2023, an AC tech came out to our apartment to fix a leak in one of our split units. Immediately after his visit, our energy usage readings started to increase substantially. After noticing the surge a few days later, we decided to increase our indoor temp from 70 degrees to 74 to offset the additional usage. Despite that, when our bill came out three weeks later, our bill was $60 more than the previous month. Our bill comparison pulled directly from FPL shows that the average outside temp was the same for the previous and current month but our bill still increased. 

Before anyone suggests that it increased because our temp was set to so low, I’d like to clarify that our AC was at 70-71 degrees for the previous two months where we paid $109-$115 for each one despite the summer heat. This time our bill was $171 and FPL identified the average outside temp as the same for BOTH months (previous and current). In the daily usage report, there’s a clear spike the day of/after the tech visit on August 4th that maintains throughout the rest of the period. After sharing this with management, they had an electrician come out, but all he did was turn the AC temperature down to 65 while he took readings from the circuit box before leaving since he was not able to communicate with us in English. Is it possible that this was caused by the AC tech when he visited on August 4th? What should my next steps be? I don’t want to continue paying more for electricity if unnecessary but management continues to blame it on the summer heat and raised FPL rates which I'm almost certain happened before July. We only have a 1bd apartment with no children. Just my bf and I.

2350,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, happy",Installing a 12k BU Window AC unit to assist my central AC during the summer heat?,"So I had an Idea to install [a window ac unit](https://a.co/d/8xRvAdB) in my living room which is the largest room in my home since its a shared space with my kitchen.

I keep my central AC at 73°. And my unit can mostly keep up and keep my home at around 76° during hot days. But yesterday was very hot. And my homes temperature were at 80°. Last year I experienced similar temps during the hottest days of the year in September. But seeing how we're in May and already experiencing super hot days. I figured I need to do something about this.

Anyways my central AC unit has no issues. It's a few years old. Filters are clean. Indoor and outdoor condenser and radiators are clean. Its my mistake for not ordering a larger unit knowing how summers get here in Florida. 

A new central unit is very expensive. Rather than spend several thousands of dollars to replace mine. I was thinking I can install a window unit to help my central AC cool my home more quickly. — at least as a temporary solution as I set aside funds to eventually replace the central AC unit.

For anyone that currently has a similar setup.

Immediately after his visit, our energy usage readings started to increase substantially. After noticing the surge a few days later, we decided to increase our indoor temp from 70 degrees to 74 to offset the additional usage. Despite that, when our bill came out three weeks later, our bill was $60 more than the previous month. Our bill comparison pulled directly from FPL shows that the average outside temp was the same for the previous and current month but our bill still increased. 

Before anyone suggests that it increased because our temp was set to so low, I’d like to clarify that our AC was at 70-71 degrees for the previous two months where we paid $109-$115 for each one despite the summer heat. This time our bill was $171 and FPL identified the average outside temp as the same for BOTH months (previous and current). In the daily usage report, there’s a clear spike the day of/after the tech visit on August 4th that maintains throughout the rest of the period. After sharing this with management, they had an electrician come out, but all he did was turn the AC temperature down to 65 while he took readings from the circuit box before leaving since he was not able to communicate with us in English. Is it possible that this was caused by the AC tech when he visited on August 4th? What should my next steps be? I don’t want to continue paying more for electricity if unnecessary but management continues to blame it on the summer heat and raised FPL rates which I'm almost certain happened before July. We only have a 1bd apartment with no children. Just my bf and I.

I keep my central AC at 73°. And my unit can mostly keep up and keep my home at around 76° during hot days. But yesterday was very hot. And my homes temperature were at 80°. Last year I experienced similar temps during the hottest days of the year in September. But seeing how we're in May and already experiencing super hot days. I figured I need to do something about this.

Anyways my central AC unit has no issues. It's a few years old. Filters are clean. Indoor and outdoor condenser and radiators are clean. Its my mistake for not ordering a larger unit knowing how summers get here in Florida. 

A new central unit is very expensive. Rather than spend several thousands of dollars to replace mine. I was thinking I can install a window unit to help my central AC cool my home more quickly. — at least as a temporary solution as I set aside funds to eventually replace the central AC unit.

Hurricanes and storms are getting more catastrophic. Each year is playing Russian roulette in terms of what part of the state is getting ""the big one"". 


I live in a coastal city, which is experiencing more frequent flooding of the streets, especially during King tides, which are worse than ever these last few years. 


Property values and rent are out of control. 


Homeowners insurance is laughable right now. How many insurance companies have stopped doing business in the state? How is this sustainable or affordable long term?


The republican leadership in this state is doing NOTHING about any of the following above and essentially are ignoring the big fat elephant in the state. 


Why would any business or person wish to invest in this state long-term knowing that all of these issues are going to get worse if they're not addressed?


I was thinking about buying an investment property here, but I am not comfortable with it, and am looking out of state now.

I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60’s?) single pane windows. I’m still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7° temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, “ewww. 80s? You lizard. 🦎“ ... Lol, the room is around 78° and is a completely uninsulated 1970’s porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I’m thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone. Democracy dies in the state. Heat makes people only care about what's actually important. So if you're from up North welcome to the Republic.

I volunteer for a non-profit that organizes free, grief/bereavement camps for children, age 7 - 17, who lost a parent, sibling, or other loved one/family member.

It's called Comfort Zone Camp (based in Virginia, but they have camps in other states, including Florida).

The next FL camp is during weekend of April 21 - 23.

https://comfortzonecamp.org

https://comfortzonecamp.org/volunteers

https://comfortzonecamp.org/calendar

They also offer camps in California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia.

The camps usually are Friday afternoon until Sunday afternoon.

The following videos are old, but show what the camp is about -

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dbk2Pigfb_U

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLwYyfpwfHU

Regarding the camping aspect...this is not tent camping.

Think of it like a summer camp where school children go and stay in cabins...so they usually use established/developed venues.

Cabins with bunk beds, restrooms with flush toilets, sinks with running water, showers, a dining room where the kitchen staff prepares meals, etc.

Volunteers typically bring their own sleeping bag, pillow, blanket, etc...but there's no need to bring other camping equipment/gear (e.g. tent, air mattress/mad/pad, stove, etc.).

If anyone is new and interested in helping, they require attending an orientation and passing a criminal background check. Children's safety is important, and multiple adult volunteers and staff will be present (in other words, no child is ever alone with an adult).

The next 2-day orientation training meeting is via Zoom:

March 27 - 28, Mon & Tues, 6:30 pm - 8:30 pm EST

https://comfortzonecamp.org/event/5851

To attend their online training meeting, click the aforementioned website above to sign up.

Some volunteers are young adults (college students, recent graduates, etc.) and some are middle age to older adults too. Kids tend to like volunteers who are friendly, fun, positive, silly, etc.

The camp is during April 21 - 23, and in Fruitland Park.

It's north of Orlando and Tampa.

It's south of Gainesville and Jacksonville.

Many people are busy, and committing an entire weekend is challenging, but maybe someone out there is good with kids, can be a positive role model (like a big brother/big sister), and is interested in helping some kids deal with grief and loss.

-

If anyone is serious or curious about learning more, check out their website and videos.

If interested in helping, follow their instructions on how to sign up at https://comfortzonecamp.org/volunteers

Attend the new volunteer training on Monday & Tuesday night (March 27 & 28).

Pass a criminal background check.

And have a fun time during camp, April 21 - 23. It's a life-changing experience for both kids and adults imo.

p.s.

If anyone knows a parent with a child(ren) who has experienced loss, please feel free to share with them about this camp (again, it's free to attend), and it can be very beneficial for kids to not feel alone in coping with their sadness, pain, grief, etc.

2403,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, love",Impact Windows and Low-E gains,"Hi all,

  
We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01

The trip itinerary is 2 day in Orlando, 4 in Miami, 5 in Keywest, 2 in Fort Myers, and 6 in Sarasota area. We are doing it all by renting cars from Alamo. The trip is about 3 weeks, and I have a tight schedule.

Give me your gut reaction on what NOT to do! And of course, on what to do as well, if you like.

Best regards!


**Edit:**
First, thank you all for the responses. They are so helpful.
To clarify, my family is composed of all adults over 25. We are quite a fit family and like the heat and love the ocean and beaches. August is the only month that was possible for us to get a vacation together as a whole family of 4.

**My notes:**
1. Get sunscreen. A lot of it!
2. Stay hydrated and bring plenty of water.
3. Wear UV-protective clothing.
4. Drive carefully and be nice to everyone.
5. Spend more days in the Keys area and less time in Fort Myers and Sarasota. Go to Tampa/St. Pete instead.
6. I will stay out of trouble. I'm just there for a nice (and hot) vacation.",2024-05-05 15:48:01

2413,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, love",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60’s?) single pane windows. I’m still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7° temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, “ewww. 80s? You lizard. 🦎“ ... Lol, the room is around 78° and is a completely uninsulated 1970’s porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I’m thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

However, I was born and raised in Florida, moved out of the state almost a decade ago now and every year I think about moving back but I am afraid of only being drawn back by nostalgia. I was raised in Pasco County, to give you an idea of where I'm from. I had no choice but to move, seeing as I was a minor at the time but now that I am financially stable and have nothing tying me down I've been toying with the idea to move back. I hate the winters, the snow is absolutely awful and just this last week it was -38 here in Montana. I have no love for snow sports, I love the heat and the humidity is something I'm used to. I would much rather do warm activities such as exploring, boating, hiking, and things of that nature. 

The main reason I want to move back to Florida is all my siblings live there with their kids, I am very family oriented and want to be involved in their lives. I know it's gotten far more expensive to live, but I am also moving from a place where a 1bd/1bath costs about 2,000$ a month. Car insurance here is cheap but car registration is not. Food prices are insane, but gas prices are low currently. Not to mention, the harsh conditions of the roads and the snow causes ware and tear on your vehicle. Within two months of living in Montana I had accumulated two cracks in my windshield and I stay far behind others while driving. All this to say, I am not very happy here.  Also Montana is very isolated with their cities, you have to drive at least two hours to get to another 'big' city. I like populated areas, being in the city. Yada yada.

2431,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, love",Hurricane Prep List.,"1. Charge any device that provides light. Laptops, tablets, cameras, video cameras, and old phones. Old cell phones can still used for dialing 911. Charge external battery backups. ( Glow sticks also provide light for a few hours. Stand them upright in a glass or jar to make a lantern.)
2. Wash all trash cans, big and small, and fill them with water for flushing toilets. Line outdoor trash cans with trash bags, fill them with water and store them in the garage. Add bleach to sterilize. 
3. Fill every tub and sink with water. Cover sinks with Saran Wrap to keep it from collecting dust. Fill the washing machine and leave the lid up to store water.
4. Fill old empty water bottles and other containers with water and keep them near sinks for washing hands. 
5. Fill every Tupperware with water and store it in the freezer. These will help keep food cold longer and serve as a backup water supply. 
6. Fill drinking cups with water and cover with Saran Wrap. Store as many as possible in the fridge. You can store the rest on the counter and use it before opening any water bottles. Ice is impossible to find after the storm.
7. Reserve fridge space for storing tap water and keep the sealed water bottles on the counter. 
8. Cook any meats in advance and other perishable foods. You can freeze cooked food. Hard boil eggs for snacks for the first day without power. 
9. Be well hydrated before the storm hits and avoid salty foods that make you dehydrated. 
10. Wash all dirty clothes and bed sheets. Anything dirty will smell without the A/C, you may need the items, and with no A/C, you'll be sweating a lot. You're going to want clean sheets. 
11. Toss out any expired food, clean cat litter boxes, and empty all trash cans in the house, including bathrooms. Remove anything that will cause an odor when the A/C is off. If you don't have a trash day pickup before the storm, find a dumpster. 
12. Bring in any yard decor, secure anything that will fly around, secure gates, bring in hoses, potted plants, etc. Bring in patio furniture and grills. 
13. Clean your environment so you have clear, easy escape routes. Even if that means temporarily moving furniture to one area. 
14. Scrub all bathrooms so you are starting with a clean odor-free environment. Store water-filled trash cans next to each toilet for flushing. 
15. Place everything you own that is important and necessary in a backpack or small file box that is easy to grab. Include your wallet with ID, phone, hand sanitizer, snacks, etc. Get plastic sleeves for important documents.
16. Make sure you have cash on hand.
17. Stock up on pet food and fill up bowls of water for pets. 
18. Refill any medications. Most insurance companies allow for 2 emergency refills per year.
19. Fill your propane tanks. You can heat soup cans, boil water, make coffee, and other stuff besides just grilling meat. Get an extra, if possible.
20. Drop your A/C in advance and lower temperatures in your fridges. 
21. Gather all candles, flashlights, lighters, matches, batteries, and other items and keep them accessible. 
22. Clean all counters in advance. Start with a clean surface. Buy Clorox Wipes for cleaning when there is no power. Mop your floors and vacuum. If power is out for 10 days, you'll have to live in the mess you started with. 
23. Pick your emergency safe place such as a closet under the stairs. Store the items you'll need in that location for the brunt of the storm. Make a hand fan for when the power is out. 
24. Shower just before the storm is scheduled to hit. 
25. Keep baby wipes next to each toilet. Don't flush them. It's not the time to risk clogging your toilet!
26. Run your dishwasher, don't risk having dirty smelly dishes and you need every container for water! Remember you'll need clean water for brushing your teeth, washing yourself, and cleaning your hands. 
27. Put a small suitcase in your car in case you decide to evacuate. Also, put at least one jug of water in your car. It will still be there if you don't evacuate!  Remember to pack for pets as well. 
28. Check on all family members, set up emergency backup plans, and check on elderly neighbors. 
29. Remember, pets are family too. Take them with you!
30. Before the storm, unplug all electronics. There will be power surges during and after the storm.
31. Gas up your car and have a spare gas container for your generator or your car when you run out.
32 . Use plastic cups and paper plates. 👍  You need water to wash dishes....👎
33 . Also if you run out of water tap your hot water heater it can have up to 30 gallons stored in there.
34 . Put water in balloons and store it in the freezer.
35 . If it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown Flush it down!💩
If you can, take a video of your house and contents....walk room to room--open cabinets/drawers and closets.  This will help if you need to make a claim later.  It will show proof of items and help you list all the items (help your memory, so you don't forget anything)...I highly recommend it!!!
I also heard you should freeze a cup of water, and place a coin on top after it is frozen...keep this in your freezer to help you gauge the temperature if the power goes out.  If the coin stays on top, the food is staying frozen.  If the coin falls into the water, the freezer thawed out and most food will likely need to be thrown away.  This is super helpful is you have to leave and come back, as it may appear everything is still frozen, but if the coin is in the cup--you will know!!",2024-10-09 14:45:24

2433,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, love",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

My boss went to a newer RV park by the Keys recently and looking at the pics, it was entirely exposed without any trees aside from the occasional tiny palm between lots. That wasn’t appealing at all to me as they had to spend the entire time IN the RV due to the direct sunlight. 

I’d love to be able to get some snorkeling in but outside of that, I’m not looking for a ton of things to do as I need this vacation to be as chilled out as possible.

2444,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, love",Could the AC tech have caused this surge in our electricity bill?,"On August 4th, 2023, an AC tech came out to our apartment to fix a leak in one of our split units. Immediately after his visit, our energy usage readings started to increase substantially. After noticing the surge a few days later, we decided to increase our indoor temp from 70 degrees to 74 to offset the additional usage. Despite that, when our bill came out three weeks later, our bill was $60 more than the previous month. Our bill comparison pulled directly from FPL shows that the average outside temp was the same for the previous and current month but our bill still increased. 

Before anyone suggests that it increased because our temp was set to so low, I’d like to clarify that our AC was at 70-71 degrees for the previous two months where we paid $109-$115 for each one despite the summer heat. This time our bill was $171 and FPL identified the average outside temp as the same for BOTH months (previous and current). In the daily usage report, there’s a clear spike the day of/after the tech visit on August 4th that maintains throughout the rest of the period. After sharing this with management, they had an electrician come out, but all he did was turn the AC temperature down to 65 while he took readings from the circuit box before leaving since he was not able to communicate with us in English. Is it possible that this was caused by the AC tech when he visited on August 4th? What should my next steps be? I don’t want to continue paying more for electricity if unnecessary but management continues to blame it on the summer heat and raised FPL rates which I'm almost certain happened before July. We only have a 1bd apartment with no children. Just my bf and I.

I keep my central AC at 73°. And my unit can mostly keep up and keep my home at around 76° during hot days. But yesterday was very hot. And my homes temperature were at 80°. Last year I experienced similar temps during the hottest days of the year in September. But seeing how we're in May and already experiencing super hot days. I figured I need to do something about this.

Anyways my central AC unit has no issues. It's a few years old. Filters are clean. Indoor and outdoor condenser and radiators are clean. Its my mistake for not ordering a larger unit knowing how summers get here in Florida. 

A new central unit is very expensive. Rather than spend several thousands of dollars to replace mine. I was thinking I can install a window unit to help my central AC cool my home more quickly. — at least as a temporary solution as I set aside funds to eventually replace the central AC unit.

1. The stairs leading up to the second floor rooms are shaky and you have to use the handrails to not fall.  However, the handrails have broken and chipped paint that hurt your hands and are rusting.  Even the property manager told us she doesn't like going up and down those stairs.

2.  The drain in the hot tub looks like it spent the last 20 years under water on a ship wreck.  It was so rusted, we did not feel comfortable using it.

3.  The swimming pool and the heated mineral pool were filthy.  We actually used the skimmer to try to clean the mineral pool ourselves, but once we got in, we saw all the scum on the tiles and quickly got out.

4.  The towels were stained and had large rips.

5.  The wifi and TV service never worked the entire time we were there.

6.  Our plans changed and we needed to leave a day early.  I talked to the property manager and she said she would change the reservation and refund us what we had paid for the last night of the stay that we wouldn't be using.  We left by 10am that morning so they had plenty of time to clean the room and prepare it for someone else.  It turned out that she lied and never gave us the refund.  When we complained afterwards through Expedia's customer service, they tried contacting the property but could not get approval for the refund so we ended up paying over $300 for a night in a room we didn't use even after being assured that wouldn't happen.

7.  The nice and quiet atmosphere is now ruined by a bar that is directly adjacent to the property.  Our room was on the opposite side of the property but we still could hear the customers and the music through the walls until after 2am each night.

8.  One of the ""features"" they mention is that you are within view of the historical Flagler Beach pier.  They don't mention it was badly damaged in a storm over 2 years ago and has not been repaired and is just boarded up.  The last section of it looks like it will fall into the ocean anytime now.

9.  One of the two mornings we were there, we came down for breakfast and were told that the cook just didn't show up that day so our bed and breakfast had no breakfast but no compensation was offered for this.10.  The waitress was telling us private stuff about other staff members like a cracked skull during a fight with her boyfriend.  That isn't the story you want to hear on your romantic anniversary trip and should have been told to the police instead or out of town customers.

Overall, this place is poorly managed, not maintained and way overpriced for what you are getting.  I highly recommend avoiding it and if you have reservations already, cancel them and then monitor your credit card to make sure they don't charge you anyway.",2024-04-12 13:42:02

Unrelenting humidity clings to the air,
It's the most horrible time, with little to spare.

The beaches are crowded, seeking some respite,
But the scorching sand makes walking a fight,
Sunscreen and shade can only do so much,
In this unbearable heat, there's no gentle touch.

It's the most horrible time of the year, indeed,
With temperatures soaring, it's a challenging feat,

But Floridians persevere, even in the heat,
Hoping for cooler days to finally greet.

So let's endure this season, despite the dismay,
Knowing that relief will come someday,
Though it's the most horrible time, we'll prevail,
And eagerly await when cooler winds prevail.",2023-05-19 22:38:33

2458,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, hate",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60’s?) single pane windows. I’m still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7° temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, “ewww. 80s? You lizard. 🦎“ ... Lol, the room is around 78° and is a completely uninsulated 1970’s porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I’m thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

2470,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, hate",Thinking about moving to Florida from Montana.,"Don't get me wrong, Montana is an absolutely gorgeous state with views that don't compare to many other places. However, I was born and raised in Florida, moved out of the state almost a decade ago now and every year I think about moving back but I am afraid of only being drawn back by nostalgia. I was raised in Pasco County, to give you an idea of where I'm from. I had no choice but to move, seeing as I was a minor at the time but now that I am financially stable and have nothing tying me down I've been toying with the idea to move back. I hate the winters, the snow is absolutely awful and just this last week it was -38 here in Montana. I have no love for snow sports, I love the heat and the humidity is something I'm used to. I would much rather do warm activities such as exploring, boating, hiking, and things of that nature. 

The main reason I want to move back to Florida is all my siblings live there with their kids, I am very family oriented and want to be involved in their lives. I know it's gotten far more expensive to live, but I am also moving from a place where a 1bd/1bath costs about 2,000$ a month. Car insurance here is cheap but car registration is not. Food prices are insane, but gas prices are low currently. Not to mention, the harsh conditions of the roads and the snow causes ware and tear on your vehicle. Within two months of living in Montana I had accumulated two cracks in my windshield and I stay far behind others while driving. All this to say, I am not very happy here.  Also Montana is very isolated with their cities, you have to drive at least two hours to get to another 'big' city. I like populated areas, being in the city. Yada yada. 

I've lived in Saint Louis, Detroit, and now a rinky-dink town in Montana so I am no stranger to extremely populated areas with high crime rates, low pay, and extremely populated areas.

We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01

Old cell phones can still used for dialing 911. Charge external battery backups. ( Glow sticks also provide light for a few hours. Stand them upright in a glass or jar to make a lantern.)
2. Wash all trash cans, big and small, and fill them with water for flushing toilets. Line outdoor trash cans with trash bags, fill them with water and store them in the garage. Add bleach to sterilize. 
3. Fill every tub and sink with water. Cover sinks with Saran Wrap to keep it from collecting dust. Fill the washing machine and leave the lid up to store water.
4. Fill old empty water bottles and other containers with water and keep them near sinks for washing hands. 
5. Fill every Tupperware with water and store it in the freezer. These will help keep food cold longer and serve as a backup water supply. 
6. Fill drinking cups with water and cover with Saran Wrap. Store as many as possible in the fridge. You can store the rest on the counter and use it before opening any water bottles. Ice is impossible to find after the storm.
7. Reserve fridge space for storing tap water and keep the sealed water bottles on the counter. 
8. Cook any meats in advance and other perishable foods. You can freeze cooked food. Hard boil eggs for snacks for the first day without power. 
9. Be well hydrated before the storm hits and avoid salty foods that make you dehydrated. 
10. Wash all dirty clothes and bed sheets. Anything dirty will smell without the A/C, you may need the items, and with no A/C, you'll be sweating a lot. You're going to want clean sheets. 
11. Toss out any expired food, clean cat litter boxes, and empty all trash cans in the house, including bathrooms. Remove anything that will cause an odor when the A/C is off. If you don't have a trash day pickup before the storm, find a dumpster. 
12. Bring in any yard decor, secure anything that will fly around, secure gates, bring in hoses, potted plants, etc. Bring in patio furniture and grills. 
13. Clean your environment so you have clear, easy escape routes. Even if that means temporarily moving furniture to one area. 
14. Scrub all bathrooms so you are starting with a clean odor-free environment. Store water-filled trash cans next to each toilet for flushing. 
15. Place everything you own that is important and necessary in a backpack or small file box that is easy to grab. Include your wallet with ID, phone, hand sanitizer, snacks, etc. Get plastic sleeves for important documents.
16. Make sure you have cash on hand.
17. Stock up on pet food and fill up bowls of water for pets. 
18. Refill any medications. Most insurance companies allow for 2 emergency refills per year.
19. Fill your propane tanks. You can heat soup cans, boil water, make coffee, and other stuff besides just grilling meat. Get an extra, if possible.
20. Drop your A/C in advance and lower temperatures in your fridges. 
21. Gather all candles, flashlights, lighters, matches, batteries, and other items and keep them accessible. 
22. Clean all counters in advance. Start with a clean surface. Buy Clorox Wipes for cleaning when there is no power. Mop your floors and vacuum. If power is out for 10 days, you'll have to live in the mess you started with. 
23. Pick your emergency safe place such as a closet under the stairs. Store the items you'll need in that location for the brunt of the storm. Make a hand fan for when the power is out. 
24. Shower just before the storm is scheduled to hit. 
25. Keep baby wipes next to each toilet. Don't flush them. It's not the time to risk clogging your toilet!
26. Run your dishwasher, don't risk having dirty smelly dishes and you need every container for water! Remember you'll need clean water for brushing your teeth, washing yourself, and cleaning your hands. 
27. Put a small suitcase in your car in case you decide to evacuate. Also, put at least one jug of water in your car. It will still be there if you don't evacuate!  Remember to pack for pets as well. 
28. Check on all family members, set up emergency backup plans, and check on elderly neighbors. 
29. Remember, pets are family too. Take them with you!
30. Before the storm, unplug all electronics. There will be power surges during and after the storm.
31. Gas up your car and have a spare gas container for your generator or your car when you run out.
32 . Use plastic cups and paper plates. 👍  You need water to wash dishes....👎
33 . Also if you run out of water tap your hot water heater it can have up to 30 gallons stored in there.
34 . Put water in balloons and store it in the freezer.
35 . If it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown Flush it down!💩
If you can, take a video of your house and contents....walk room to room--open cabinets/drawers and closets.  This will help if you need to make a claim later.  It will show proof of items and help you list all the items (help your memory, so you don't forget anything)...I highly recommend it!!!
I also heard you should freeze a cup of water, and place a coin on top after it is frozen...keep this in your freezer to help you gauge the temperature if the power goes out.  If the coin stays on top, the food is staying frozen.  If the coin falls into the water, the freezer thawed out and most food will likely need to be thrown away.  This is super helpful is you have to leave and come back, as it may appear everything is still frozen, but if the coin is in the cup--you will know!!",2024-10-09 14:45:24

1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.

We looked at the Hard Rock , too commercial 
We want some place that is clean looks like it’s been kept up (painted/neat) and the people are nice.

Would like to have the ceremony and reception at the same location.

Must have A/C for our northern part of family who hates the heat.

Would love something historic or traditional…but something extra special. A hotel is fine if it’s nice.

If you can’t remember the name of the place if you tell me where it’s located and the type of place I can figure it out.

2481,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, hate",Could the AC tech have caused this surge in our electricity bill?,"On August 4th, 2023, an AC tech came out to our apartment to fix a leak in one of our split units. Immediately after his visit, our energy usage readings started to increase substantially. After noticing the surge a few days later, we decided to increase our indoor temp from 70 degrees to 74 to offset the additional usage. Despite that, when our bill came out three weeks later, our bill was $60 more than the previous month. Our bill comparison pulled directly from FPL shows that the average outside temp was the same for the previous and current month but our bill still increased. 

Before anyone suggests that it increased because our temp was set to so low, I’d like to clarify that our AC was at 70-71 degrees for the previous two months where we paid $109-$115 for each one despite the summer heat. This time our bill was $171 and FPL identified the average outside temp as the same for BOTH months (previous and current). In the daily usage report, there’s a clear spike the day of/after the tech visit on August 4th that maintains throughout the rest of the period. After sharing this with management, they had an electrician come out, but all he did was turn the AC temperature down to 65 while he took readings from the circuit box before leaving since he was not able to communicate with us in English. Is it possible that this was caused by the AC tech when he visited on August 4th? What should my next steps be? I don’t want to continue paying more for electricity if unnecessary but management continues to blame it on the summer heat and raised FPL rates which I'm almost certain happened before July. We only have a 1bd apartment with no children. Just my bf and I.

I keep my central AC at 73°. And my unit can mostly keep up and keep my home at around 76° during hot days. But yesterday was very hot. And my homes temperature were at 80°. Last year I experienced similar temps during the hottest days of the year in September. But seeing how we're in May and already experiencing super hot days. I figured I need to do something about this.

Anyways my central AC unit has no issues. It's a few years old. Filters are clean. Indoor and outdoor condenser and radiators are clean. Its my mistake for not ordering a larger unit knowing how summers get here in Florida. 

A new central unit is very expensive. Rather than spend several thousands of dollars to replace mine. I was thinking I can install a window unit to help my central AC cool my home more quickly. — at least as a temporary solution as I set aside funds to eventually replace the central AC unit.

For anyone that currently has a similar setup.

But the scorching sand makes walking a fight,

With temperatures soaring, it's a challenging feat,

Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone.

Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

Hello everybody, 

So my kids are finally old enough to appreciate the trip from Ireland to the USA. We are doing the quintessential Europeans coming to Orlando trip.

We are coming mid July 🥵 for 14 days. There are 10 of us, my family & the inlaws. 

Me and my wife have been there several times each, most recent was with her folks in 2005 and 2007 (not counting our honeymoon to New York in 2010). So I like to think we have some sort of handle on the logistics. 

Those previous times, I was too young to drive a hire car (I was 20 on the 2007 trip). 

This time, we have 2 cars, and 2 seperate houses, so I'll be one of the lead drivers. Any tips or advice for driving around? Swapping to left hand drive is no problem for me, but certain rules of the road such as turning right on red etc is not a thing here in Ireland. I'm not nervous about it, but just looking for any tips or things to look out for. 

We will be doing parks, shopping, sightseeing.

Thanks I'm advance!

Update: Wow, the response has been incredible! Thank you, EVERYBODY, for your contributions. There has been some seriously invaluable advice given and I appreciate everyone for taking the time to drop your help below! It has reaffirmed some of my experiences from the past and given me some foresight for what to expect now I will be driving this time. 

I can't wait to bring my kids to experience what was my absolute best childhood holiday 😍 

Update!: it's currently Monday 29th, got back from 2 weeks in wonderful Orlando last Thursday morning after an overnight flight from MCO. 

As expected; the trip was amazing, the people were amazing, the parks were amazing. Everything was great. 
Unfortunately we didn't get to see and do everything on our list, we listened to the kids and if they had reached their limit it was home-time! This meant we only spent 3~hours in Magic Kingdom, but it was the first park, they were still adjusting to the heat etc. 

Within a couple days we were doing lots more, kids got on any ride they wanted, they all thoroughly enjoyed it. 

Their favourites were Legoland and Seaworld, and the villa having our own pool was a godsend. 
Rental was a Ford Expedition, can't get them at home so now I'm missing the big suv 😅 

We have munched through our Cheetos, Ruffles & Reeses haul already 🤣 

Thanks Florida, the 17 years was worth the wait, let's hope it's not even 1/4 of that time before the next visit 😉 ",2024-03-10 14:19:11

I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60’s?) single pane windows. I’m still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7° temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, “ewww. 80s? You lizard. 🦎“ ... Lol, the room is around 78° and is a completely uninsulated 1970’s porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I’m thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

However, I was born and raised in Florida, moved out of the state almost a decade ago now and every year I think about moving back but I am afraid of only being drawn back by nostalgia. I was raised in Pasco County, to give you an idea of where I'm from. I had no choice but to move, seeing as I was a minor at the time but now that I am financially stable and have nothing tying me down I've been toying with the idea to move back. I hate the winters, the snow is absolutely awful and just this last week it was -38 here in Montana. I have no love for snow sports, I love the heat and the humidity is something I'm used to. I would much rather do warm activities such as exploring, boating, hiking, and things of that nature. 

The main reason I want to move back to Florida is all my siblings live there with their kids, I am very family oriented and want to be involved in their lives. I know it's gotten far more expensive to live, but I am also moving from a place where a 1bd/1bath costs about 2,000$ a month. Car insurance here is cheap but car registration is not. Food prices are insane, but gas prices are low currently. Not to mention, the harsh conditions of the roads and the snow causes ware and tear on your vehicle. Within two months of living in Montana I had accumulated two cracks in my windshield and I stay far behind others while driving. All this to say, I am not very happy here.  Also Montana is very isolated with their cities, you have to drive at least two hours to get to another 'big' city. I like populated areas, being in the city. Yada yada. 

I've lived in Saint Louis, Detroit, and now a rinky-dink town in Montana so I am no stranger to extremely populated areas with high crime rates, low pay, and extremely populated areas. 

For those of you who were born in Florida, left and then came back, was it something you regretted or were you drawn back and enjoying it?  ",2024-01-18 19:44:01

2508,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, enjoy",Impact Windows and Low-E gains,"Hi all,

  
We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01
2509,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, enjoy",Hurricane Prep List.,"1. Charge any device that provides light. Laptops, tablets, cameras, video cameras, and old phones. Old cell phones can still used for dialing 911. Charge external battery backups. ( Glow sticks also provide light for a few hours. Stand them upright in a glass or jar to make a lantern.)
2. Wash all trash cans, big and small, and fill them with water for flushing toilets. Line outdoor trash cans with trash bags, fill them with water and store them in the garage. Add bleach to sterilize. 
3. Fill every tub and sink with water. Cover sinks with Saran Wrap to keep it from collecting dust. Fill the washing machine and leave the lid up to store water.
4. Fill old empty water bottles and other containers with water and keep them near sinks for washing hands. 
5. Fill every Tupperware with water and store it in the freezer. These will help keep food cold longer and serve as a backup water supply. 
6. Fill drinking cups with water and cover with Saran Wrap. Store as many as possible in the fridge. You can store the rest on the counter and use it before opening any water bottles. Ice is impossible to find after the storm.
7. Reserve fridge space for storing tap water and keep the sealed water bottles on the counter. 
8. Cook any meats in advance and other perishable foods. You can freeze cooked food. Hard boil eggs for snacks for the first day without power. 
9. Be well hydrated before the storm hits and avoid salty foods that make you dehydrated. 
10. Wash all dirty clothes and bed sheets. Anything dirty will smell without the A/C, you may need the items, and with no A/C, you'll be sweating a lot. You're going to want clean sheets. 
11. Toss out any expired food, clean cat litter boxes, and empty all trash cans in the house, including bathrooms. Remove anything that will cause an odor when the A/C is off. If you don't have a trash day pickup before the storm, find a dumpster. 
12. Bring in any yard decor, secure anything that will fly around, secure gates, bring in hoses, potted plants, etc. Bring in patio furniture and grills. 
13. Clean your environment so you have clear, easy escape routes. Even if that means temporarily moving furniture to one area. 
14. Scrub all bathrooms so you are starting with a clean odor-free environment. Store water-filled trash cans next to each toilet for flushing. 
15. Place everything you own that is important and necessary in a backpack or small file box that is easy to grab. Include your wallet with ID, phone, hand sanitizer, snacks, etc. Get plastic sleeves for important documents.
16. Make sure you have cash on hand.
17. Stock up on pet food and fill up bowls of water for pets. 
18. Refill any medications. Most insurance companies allow for 2 emergency refills per year.
19. Fill your propane tanks. You can heat soup cans, boil water, make coffee, and other stuff besides just grilling meat. Get an extra, if possible.
20. Drop your A/C in advance and lower temperatures in your fridges. 
21. Gather all candles, flashlights, lighters, matches, batteries, and other items and keep them accessible. 
22. Clean all counters in advance. Start with a clean surface. Buy Clorox Wipes for cleaning when there is no power. Mop your floors and vacuum. If power is out for 10 days, you'll have to live in the mess you started with. 
23. Pick your emergency safe place such as a closet under the stairs. Store the items you'll need in that location for the brunt of the storm. Make a hand fan for when the power is out. 
24. Shower just before the storm is scheduled to hit. 
25. Keep baby wipes next to each toilet. Don't flush them. It's not the time to risk clogging your toilet!
26. Run your dishwasher, don't risk having dirty smelly dishes and you need every container for water! Remember you'll need clean water for brushing your teeth, washing yourself, and cleaning your hands. 
27. Put a small suitcase in your car in case you decide to evacuate. Also, put at least one jug of water in your car. It will still be there if you don't evacuate!  Remember to pack for pets as well. 
28. Check on all family members, set up emergency backup plans, and check on elderly neighbors. 
29. Remember, pets are family too. Take them with you!
30. Before the storm, unplug all electronics. There will be power surges during and after the storm.
31. Gas up your car and have a spare gas container for your generator or your car when you run out.
32 . Use plastic cups and paper plates. 👍  You need water to wash dishes....👎
33 . Also if you run out of water tap your hot water heater it can have up to 30 gallons stored in there.
34 . Put water in balloons and store it in the freezer.
35 . If it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown Flush it down!💩
If you can, take a video of your house and contents....walk room to room--open cabinets/drawers and closets.  This will help if you need to make a claim later.  It will show proof of items and help you list all the items (help your memory, so you don't forget anything)...I highly recommend it!!!
I also heard you should freeze a cup of water, and place a coin on top after it is frozen...keep this in your freezer to help you gauge the temperature if the power goes out.  If the coin stays on top, the food is staying frozen.  If the coin falls into the water, the freezer thawed out and most food will likely need to be thrown away.  This is super helpful is you have to leave and come back, as it may appear everything is still frozen, but if the coin is in the cup--you will know!!",2024-10-09 14:45:24

Too bad Jimmy Buffet didn't sing songs about how hot it is here in FL.

I’m in Broward and what I’m looking for is something by some water, preferably with a ton of tree coverage where I can park the RV and set up a couple chairs outside to not bake in direct heat. 

My boss went to a newer RV park by the Keys recently and looking at the pics, it was entirely exposed without any trees aside from the occasional tiny palm between lots. That wasn’t appealing at all to me as they had to spend the entire time IN the RV due to the direct sunlight. 

I’d love to be able to get some snorkeling in but outside of that, I’m not looking for a ton of things to do as I need this vacation to be as chilled out as possible. Ideally I’ll be getting some snorkeling done during the day then sitting by the RV with a guitar for the rest of the night relaxing.

2517,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, enjoy",Could the AC tech have caused this surge in our electricity bill?,"On August 4th, 2023, an AC tech came out to our apartment to fix a leak in one of our split units. Immediately after his visit, our energy usage readings started to increase substantially. After noticing the surge a few days later, we decided to increase our indoor temp from 70 degrees to 74 to offset the additional usage. Despite that, when our bill came out three weeks later, our bill was $60 more than the previous month. Our bill comparison pulled directly from FPL shows that the average outside temp was the same for the previous and current month but our bill still increased. 

Before anyone suggests that it increased because our temp was set to so low, I’d like to clarify that our AC was at 70-71 degrees for the previous two months where we paid $109-$115 for each one despite the summer heat. This time our bill was $171 and FPL identified the average outside temp as the same for BOTH months (previous and current). In the daily usage report, there’s a clear spike the day of/after the tech visit on August 4th that maintains throughout the rest of the period. After sharing this with management, they had an electrician come out, but all he did was turn the AC temperature down to 65 while he took readings from the circuit box before leaving since he was not able to communicate with us in English. Is it possible that this was caused by the AC tech when he visited on August 4th? What should my next steps be? I don’t want to continue paying more for electricity if unnecessary but management continues to blame it on the summer heat and raised FPL rates which I'm almost certain happened before July. We only have a 1bd apartment with no children. Just my bf and I.

I keep my central AC at 73°. And my unit can mostly keep up and keep my home at around 76° during hot days. But yesterday was very hot. And my homes temperature were at 80°. Last year I experienced similar temps during the hottest days of the year in September. But seeing how we're in May and already experiencing super hot days. I figured I need to do something about this.

Anyways my central AC unit has no issues. It's a few years old. Filters are clean. Indoor and outdoor condenser and radiators are clean. Its my mistake for not ordering a larger unit knowing how summers get here in Florida. 

A new central unit is very expensive. Rather than spend several thousands of dollars to replace mine. I was thinking I can install a window unit to help my central AC cool my home more quickly. — at least as a temporary solution as I set aside funds to eventually replace the central AC unit.

For anyone that currently has a similar setup.

With heatwaves relentless, it's hard to withstand,
The sun's burning rays, they cause quite a fright,
It's the most horrible time, try as we might.

There'll be sweat-soaked shirts and sunburned skin,

As the heat engulfs, it feels like a sin,
No relief in sight, just oppressive heat,
It's the most horrible time, it can't be beat.

The air conditioner hums, working overtime,
But it's a battle lost against the summertime,
Muggy and stifling, the air feels heavy,
In this sweltering season, it's hard to be merry.

There'll be wilted flowers and dried-up lawns,

As the heat persists, nature's beauty is gone,
Unrelenting humidity clings to the air,
It's the most horrible time, with little to spare.

The beaches are crowded, seeking some respite,
But the scorching sand makes walking a fight,
Sunscreen and shade can only do so much,
In this unbearable heat, there's no gentle touch.

It's the most horrible time of the year, indeed,
With temperatures soaring, it's a challenging feat,

My fiancé and I are getting married in September, and he really really really wants to honeymoon in Florida. Originally we were going to do Vegas, but we are going there in October for a concert anyway, so he doesn’t wanna “double dip” and wants to go somewhere different. 

I’ve never been outside of the western half of the United States other than Germany, and am very used to mountains and alligator free lakes, and I’ve never seen the ocean. But the part I’m worried about the most is the HUMIDITY and wet heat. My state (Montana) is dry heat. So it’s usually more manageable. 

I am a *large* woman and the whitest of white without being a redhead, so I’m concerned about getting swamp ass (that I already get here in the summer) and being miserable the whole trip. 

And though I am excited about seeing the ocean, I’m also terrified of it and probably wouldn’t want to go more than ankle deep because of sharks lol. (I bet I would look like a real nice fat seal) though my fiancé says he’s gonna convince me lol. 

I’m just wondering where in the state is the prettiest as far as beaches go, but also not completely PACKED with people? And what time of year would be best to go to avoid crazy heat and tons of people? We may not honeymoon directly after the wedding, we may wait till after the new year. I’m aware it’s Florida and it’s gonna be busy either way, but I would love to be able to enjoy the beach and stuff without 1000 other people the same day lol. 

Also what kind of tourist stuff would be recommended? Because of my size, I probably wouldn’t fit on a lot of the rides at Disney, so unsure about going there. 

Would you recommend to stay at a resort or a hotel? What should I avoid? Please just give me a good rundown so I can hopefully actually enjoy my time. We will be going for somewhere between 5-7 days.

So you are aware the Florida born and raised can wear black sweater and a hoodie outside as I do this everyday. I wore the black hoodie to keep the sunlight off me. Even when I worked outside doing manual labor I kept a sweater on me. At lunch time when you take it off everything feels frigid like you just walked into a 73° house. This all comes from personal experience. If you're not seasoned for heat then you probably shouldn't be in Florida. It takes time for your body to be acclimated to the harsh climate here. What most people would consider suffering humidity we as Floridians don't really even notice it most of the time. Because when you're born in it, that just makes it business as usual. I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone.

Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though.

I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.
 
I’m curious what you all have to say.",2024-06-12 14:37:32

We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01
2538,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, dislike",Hurricane Prep List.,"1. Charge any device that provides light. Laptops, tablets, cameras, video cameras, and old phones. Old cell phones can still used for dialing 911. Charge external battery backups. ( Glow sticks also provide light for a few hours. Stand them upright in a glass or jar to make a lantern.)
2. Wash all trash cans, big and small, and fill them with water for flushing toilets. Line outdoor trash cans with trash bags, fill them with water and store them in the garage. Add bleach to sterilize. 
3. Fill every tub and sink with water. Cover sinks with Saran Wrap to keep it from collecting dust. Fill the washing machine and leave the lid up to store water.
4. Fill old empty water bottles and other containers with water and keep them near sinks for washing hands. 
5. Fill every Tupperware with water and store it in the freezer. These will help keep food cold longer and serve as a backup water supply. 
6. Fill drinking cups with water and cover with Saran Wrap. Store as many as possible in the fridge. You can store the rest on the counter and use it before opening any water bottles. Ice is impossible to find after the storm.
7. Reserve fridge space for storing tap water and keep the sealed water bottles on the counter. 
8. Cook any meats in advance and other perishable foods. You can freeze cooked food. Hard boil eggs for snacks for the first day without power. 
9. Be well hydrated before the storm hits and avoid salty foods that make you dehydrated. 
10. Wash all dirty clothes and bed sheets. Anything dirty will smell without the A/C, you may need the items, and with no A/C, you'll be sweating a lot. You're going to want clean sheets. 
11. Toss out any expired food, clean cat litter boxes, and empty all trash cans in the house, including bathrooms. Remove anything that will cause an odor when the A/C is off. If you don't have a trash day pickup before the storm, find a dumpster. 
12. Bring in any yard decor, secure anything that will fly around, secure gates, bring in hoses, potted plants, etc. Bring in patio furniture and grills. 
13. Clean your environment so you have clear, easy escape routes. Even if that means temporarily moving furniture to one area. 
14. Scrub all bathrooms so you are starting with a clean odor-free environment. Store water-filled trash cans next to each toilet for flushing. 
15. Place everything you own that is important and necessary in a backpack or small file box that is easy to grab. Include your wallet with ID, phone, hand sanitizer, snacks, etc. Get plastic sleeves for important documents.
16. Make sure you have cash on hand.
17. Stock up on pet food and fill up bowls of water for pets. 
18. Refill any medications. Most insurance companies allow for 2 emergency refills per year.
19. Fill your propane tanks. You can heat soup cans, boil water, make coffee, and other stuff besides just grilling meat. Get an extra, if possible.
20. Drop your A/C in advance and lower temperatures in your fridges. 
21. Gather all candles, flashlights, lighters, matches, batteries, and other items and keep them accessible. 
22. Clean all counters in advance. Start with a clean surface. Buy Clorox Wipes for cleaning when there is no power. Mop your floors and vacuum. If power is out for 10 days, you'll have to live in the mess you started with. 
23. Pick your emergency safe place such as a closet under the stairs. Store the items you'll need in that location for the brunt of the storm. Make a hand fan for when the power is out. 
24. Shower just before the storm is scheduled to hit. 
25. Keep baby wipes next to each toilet. Don't flush them. It's not the time to risk clogging your toilet!
26. Run your dishwasher, don't risk having dirty smelly dishes and you need every container for water! Remember you'll need clean water for brushing your teeth, washing yourself, and cleaning your hands. 
27. Put a small suitcase in your car in case you decide to evacuate. Also, put at least one jug of water in your car. It will still be there if you don't evacuate!  Remember to pack for pets as well. 
28. Check on all family members, set up emergency backup plans, and check on elderly neighbors. 
29. Remember, pets are family too. Take them with you!
30. Before the storm, unplug all electronics. There will be power surges during and after the storm.
31. Gas up your car and have a spare gas container for your generator or your car when you run out.
32 . Use plastic cups and paper plates. 👍  You need water to wash dishes....👎
33 . Also if you run out of water tap your hot water heater it can have up to 30 gallons stored in there.
34 . Put water in balloons and store it in the freezer.
35 . If it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown Flush it down!💩
If you can, take a video of your house and contents....walk room to room--open cabinets/drawers and closets.  This will help if you need to make a claim later.  It will show proof of items and help you list all the items (help your memory, so you don't forget anything)...I highly recommend it!!!
I also heard you should freeze a cup of water, and place a coin on top after it is frozen...keep this in your freezer to help you gauge the temperature if the power goes out.  If the coin stays on top, the food is staying frozen.  If the coin falls into the water, the freezer thawed out and most food will likely need to be thrown away.  This is super helpful is you have to leave and come back, as it may appear everything is still frozen, but if the coin is in the cup--you will know!!",2024-10-09 14:45:24

2541,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, dislike",Could the AC tech have caused this surge in our electricity bill?,"On August 4th, 2023, an AC tech came out to our apartment to fix a leak in one of our split units. Immediately after his visit, our energy usage readings started to increase substantially. After noticing the surge a few days later, we decided to increase our indoor temp from 70 degrees to 74 to offset the additional usage. Despite that, when our bill came out three weeks later, our bill was $60 more than the previous month. Our bill comparison pulled directly from FPL shows that the average outside temp was the same for the previous and current month but our bill still increased. 

Before anyone suggests that it increased because our temp was set to so low, I’d like to clarify that our AC was at 70-71 degrees for the previous two months where we paid $109-$115 for each one despite the summer heat. This time our bill was $171 and FPL identified the average outside temp as the same for BOTH months (previous and current). In the daily usage report, there’s a clear spike the day of/after the tech visit on August 4th that maintains throughout the rest of the period. After sharing this with management, they had an electrician come out, but all he did was turn the AC temperature down to 65 while he took readings from the circuit box before leaving since he was not able to communicate with us in English. Is it possible that this was caused by the AC tech when he visited on August 4th? What should my next steps be? I don’t want to continue paying more for electricity if unnecessary but management continues to blame it on the summer heat and raised FPL rates which I'm almost certain happened before July. We only have a 1bd apartment with no children. Just my bf and I.

I keep my central AC at 73°. And my unit can mostly keep up and keep my home at around 76° during hot days. But yesterday was very hot. And my homes temperature were at 80°. Last year I experienced similar temps during the hottest days of the year in September. But seeing how we're in May and already experiencing super hot days. I figured I need to do something about this.

Anyways my central AC unit has no issues. It's a few years old. Filters are clean. Indoor and outdoor condenser and radiators are clean. Its my mistake for not ordering a larger unit knowing how summers get here in Florida. 

A new central unit is very expensive. Rather than spend several thousands of dollars to replace mine. I was thinking I can install a window unit to help my central AC cool my home more quickly. — at least as a temporary solution as I set aside funds to eventually replace the central AC unit.

For anyone that currently has a similar setup.

As the heat engulfs, it feels like a sin,
No relief in sight, just oppressive heat,
It's the most horrible time, it can't be beat.

But it's a battle lost against the summertime,
Muggy and stifling, the air feels heavy,
In this sweltering season, it's hard to be merry.

There'll be wilted flowers and dried-up lawns,

As the heat persists, nature's beauty is gone,
Unrelenting humidity clings to the air,
It's the most horrible time, with little to spare.

The beaches are crowded, seeking some respite,
But the scorching sand makes walking a fight,
Sunscreen and shade can only do so much,
In this unbearable heat, there's no gentle touch.

It's the most horrible time of the year, indeed,
With temperatures soaring, it's a challenging feat,

I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone.

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01
2560,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, annoying",Hurricane Prep List.,"1. Charge any device that provides light. Laptops, tablets, cameras, video cameras, and old phones. Old cell phones can still used for dialing 911. Charge external battery backups. ( Glow sticks also provide light for a few hours. Stand them upright in a glass or jar to make a lantern.)
2. Wash all trash cans, big and small, and fill them with water for flushing toilets. Line outdoor trash cans with trash bags, fill them with water and store them in the garage. Add bleach to sterilize. 
3. Fill every tub and sink with water. Cover sinks with Saran Wrap to keep it from collecting dust. Fill the washing machine and leave the lid up to store water.
4. Fill old empty water bottles and other containers with water and keep them near sinks for washing hands. 
5. Fill every Tupperware with water and store it in the freezer. These will help keep food cold longer and serve as a backup water supply. 
6. Fill drinking cups with water and cover with Saran Wrap. Store as many as possible in the fridge. You can store the rest on the counter and use it before opening any water bottles. Ice is impossible to find after the storm.
7. Reserve fridge space for storing tap water and keep the sealed water bottles on the counter. 
8. Cook any meats in advance and other perishable foods. You can freeze cooked food. Hard boil eggs for snacks for the first day without power. 
9. Be well hydrated before the storm hits and avoid salty foods that make you dehydrated. 
10. Wash all dirty clothes and bed sheets. Anything dirty will smell without the A/C, you may need the items, and with no A/C, you'll be sweating a lot. You're going to want clean sheets. 
11. Toss out any expired food, clean cat litter boxes, and empty all trash cans in the house, including bathrooms. Remove anything that will cause an odor when the A/C is off. If you don't have a trash day pickup before the storm, find a dumpster. 
12. Bring in any yard decor, secure anything that will fly around, secure gates, bring in hoses, potted plants, etc. Bring in patio furniture and grills. 
13. Clean your environment so you have clear, easy escape routes. Even if that means temporarily moving furniture to one area. 
14. Scrub all bathrooms so you are starting with a clean odor-free environment. Store water-filled trash cans next to each toilet for flushing. 
15. Place everything you own that is important and necessary in a backpack or small file box that is easy to grab. Include your wallet with ID, phone, hand sanitizer, snacks, etc. Get plastic sleeves for important documents.
16. Make sure you have cash on hand.
17. Stock up on pet food and fill up bowls of water for pets. 
18. Refill any medications. Most insurance companies allow for 2 emergency refills per year.
19. Fill your propane tanks. You can heat soup cans, boil water, make coffee, and other stuff besides just grilling meat. Get an extra, if possible.
20. Drop your A/C in advance and lower temperatures in your fridges. 
21. Gather all candles, flashlights, lighters, matches, batteries, and other items and keep them accessible. 
22. Clean all counters in advance. Start with a clean surface. Buy Clorox Wipes for cleaning when there is no power. Mop your floors and vacuum. If power is out for 10 days, you'll have to live in the mess you started with. 
23. Pick your emergency safe place such as a closet under the stairs. Store the items you'll need in that location for the brunt of the storm. Make a hand fan for when the power is out. 
24. Shower just before the storm is scheduled to hit. 
25. Keep baby wipes next to each toilet. Don't flush them. It's not the time to risk clogging your toilet!
26. Run your dishwasher, don't risk having dirty smelly dishes and you need every container for water! Remember you'll need clean water for brushing your teeth, washing yourself, and cleaning your hands. 
27. Put a small suitcase in your car in case you decide to evacuate. Also, put at least one jug of water in your car. It will still be there if you don't evacuate!  Remember to pack for pets as well. 
28. Check on all family members, set up emergency backup plans, and check on elderly neighbors. 
29. Remember, pets are family too. Take them with you!
30. Before the storm, unplug all electronics. There will be power surges during and after the storm.
31. Gas up your car and have a spare gas container for your generator or your car when you run out.
32 . Use plastic cups and paper plates. 👍  You need water to wash dishes....👎
33 . Also if you run out of water tap your hot water heater it can have up to 30 gallons stored in there.
34 . Put water in balloons and store it in the freezer.
35 . If it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown Flush it down!💩
If you can, take a video of your house and contents....walk room to room--open cabinets/drawers and closets.  This will help if you need to make a claim later.  It will show proof of items and help you list all the items (help your memory, so you don't forget anything)...I highly recommend it!!!
I also heard you should freeze a cup of water, and place a coin on top after it is frozen...keep this in your freezer to help you gauge the temperature if the power goes out.  If the coin stays on top, the food is staying frozen.  If the coin falls into the water, the freezer thawed out and most food will likely need to be thrown away.  This is super helpful is you have to leave and come back, as it may appear everything is still frozen, but if the coin is in the cup--you will know!!",2024-10-09 14:45:24

2564,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, annoying",Could the AC tech have caused this surge in our electricity bill?,"On August 4th, 2023, an AC tech came out to our apartment to fix a leak in one of our split units. Immediately after his visit, our energy usage readings started to increase substantially. After noticing the surge a few days later, we decided to increase our indoor temp from 70 degrees to 74 to offset the additional usage. Despite that, when our bill came out three weeks later, our bill was $60 more than the previous month. Our bill comparison pulled directly from FPL shows that the average outside temp was the same for the previous and current month but our bill still increased. 

Before anyone suggests that it increased because our temp was set to so low, I’d like to clarify that our AC was at 70-71 degrees for the previous two months where we paid $109-$115 for each one despite the summer heat. This time our bill was $171 and FPL identified the average outside temp as the same for BOTH months (previous and current). In the daily usage report, there’s a clear spike the day of/after the tech visit on August 4th that maintains throughout the rest of the period. After sharing this with management, they had an electrician come out, but all he did was turn the AC temperature down to 65 while he took readings from the circuit box before leaving since he was not able to communicate with us in English. Is it possible that this was caused by the AC tech when he visited on August 4th? What should my next steps be? I don’t want to continue paying more for electricity if unnecessary but management continues to blame it on the summer heat and raised FPL rates which I'm almost certain happened before July. We only have a 1bd apartment with no children. Just my bf and I.

2565,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, annoying",Installing a 12k BU Window AC unit to assist my central AC during the summer heat?,"So I had an Idea to install [a window ac unit](https://a.co/d/8xRvAdB) in my living room which is the largest room in my home since its a shared space with my kitchen.

I keep my central AC at 73°. And my unit can mostly keep up and keep my home at around 76° during hot days. But yesterday was very hot. And my homes temperature were at 80°. Last year I experienced similar temps during the hottest days of the year in September. But seeing how we're in May and already experiencing super hot days. I figured I need to do something about this.

Anyways my central AC unit has no issues. It's a few years old. Filters are clean. Indoor and outdoor condenser and radiators are clean. Its my mistake for not ordering a larger unit knowing how summers get here in Florida. 

A new central unit is very expensive. Rather than spend several thousands of dollars to replace mine. I was thinking I can install a window unit to help my central AC cool my home more quickly. — at least as a temporary solution as I set aside funds to eventually replace the central AC unit.

For anyone that currently has a similar setup.

With heatwaves relentless, it's hard to withstand,
The sun's burning rays, they cause quite a fright,
It's the most horrible time, try as we might.

There'll be sweat-soaked shirts and sunburned skin,

As the heat engulfs, it feels like a sin,
No relief in sight, just oppressive heat,
It's the most horrible time, it can't be beat.

The air conditioner hums, working overtime,
But it's a battle lost against the summertime,
Muggy and stifling, the air feels heavy,
In this sweltering season, it's hard to be merry.

There'll be wilted flowers and dried-up lawns,

As the heat persists, nature's beauty is gone,
Unrelenting humidity clings to the air,
It's the most horrible time, with little to spare.

The beaches are crowded, seeking some respite,
But the scorching sand makes walking a fight,
Sunscreen and shade can only do so much,
In this unbearable heat, there's no gentle touch.

It's the most horrible time of the year, indeed,
With temperatures soaring, it's a challenging feat,

But Floridians persevere, even in the heat,
Hoping for cooler days to finally greet.

So let's endure this season, despite the dismay,
Knowing that relief will come someday,
Though it's the most horrible time, we'll prevail,
And eagerly await when cooler winds prevail.",2023-05-19 22:38:33

I do not care about power outages it is irrelevant. It's back on in a few days or a few hours. Most people fear power outages in Florida due to the extreme temperatures and the inability to find air conditioning in such an occasion. So you are aware the Florida born and raised can wear black sweater and a hoodie outside as I do this everyday. I wore the black hoodie to keep the sunlight off me. Even when I worked outside doing manual labor I kept a sweater on me. At lunch time when you take it off everything feels frigid like you just walked into a 73° house. This all comes from personal experience. If you're not seasoned for heat then you probably shouldn't be in Florida. It takes time for your body to be acclimated to the harsh climate here. What most people would consider suffering humidity we as Floridians don't really even notice it most of the time. Because when you're born in it, that just makes it business as usual. I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone. Democracy dies in the state. Heat makes people only care about what's actually important. So if you're from up North welcome to the Republic.

2575,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, happy",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

I do have a lot of shareable knowledge, though. I dable into edible and medicinal plants as well. I live in area 10a, and I have a knowledge of 9a-9b, but I am willing to talk about other zones. 

So often, we find ourselves wanting to beautify our yards and give back to what the ""wild"" Florida used to be. However, in a more sustainably ecological way that actually lives through brutal heat, salt water inundation, flooding, or shade!

If you find yourself at local nursery's or Homedepot buying these flowering plants that wilt within a week, need constant expensive fertilizer, or never seem to last long at all; there is a solution. 

We face a heartbreaking amount of no-thought, no-care development that is tearing down ecosystems that are rare, biodiverse, and dwindling by the day.

There is one thing you can do right now and make a larger, more imediate impact on your doorstep. Besides advocating for environmental protections. That is planting true Florida native plants that support an enormous amount of wildlife by making your home a sanctuary for: birds, mammals, insects, reptiles, and amphibians. While it sounds scary, they will rarely come in if you give them a comfy home outside with food. 

The benefits are nearly endless, as true Florida blooms year round, evergreen (sometimes), bloomimg, pollinating, or providing habitat. It holds our sandy, nutrient-poor sediment together and protects it from erosion. You can get rid of your lawn and replace it with flowering groundcovers. You can do wildflowers, shrubs(small, medium, large), host plants, trees (flowering, spiny, statement), and rare plants that are losing habitat. 

I'll include pictures of what I deal with, my yard, creatures, and information. 

Please ask me any questions, I also have plenty of resources🐊

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60’s?) single pane windows. I’m still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7° temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, “ewww. 80s? You lizard. 🦎“ ... Lol, the room is around 78° and is a completely uninsulated 1970’s porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I’m thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

2586,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, happy",Thinking about moving to Florida from Montana.,"Don't get me wrong, Montana is an absolutely gorgeous state with views that don't compare to many other places. However, I was born and raised in Florida, moved out of the state almost a decade ago now and every year I think about moving back but I am afraid of only being drawn back by nostalgia. I was raised in Pasco County, to give you an idea of where I'm from. I had no choice but to move, seeing as I was a minor at the time but now that I am financially stable and have nothing tying me down I've been toying with the idea to move back. I hate the winters, the snow is absolutely awful and just this last week it was -38 here in Montana. I have no love for snow sports, I love the heat and the humidity is something I'm used to. I would much rather do warm activities such as exploring, boating, hiking, and things of that nature. 

The main reason I want to move back to Florida is all my siblings live there with their kids, I am very family oriented and want to be involved in their lives. I know it's gotten far more expensive to live, but I am also moving from a place where a 1bd/1bath costs about 2,000$ a month. Car insurance here is cheap but car registration is not. Food prices are insane, but gas prices are low currently. Not to mention, the harsh conditions of the roads and the snow causes ware and tear on your vehicle. Within two months of living in Montana I had accumulated two cracks in my windshield and I stay far behind others while driving. All this to say, I am not very happy here.  Also Montana is very isolated with their cities, you have to drive at least two hours to get to another 'big' city. I like populated areas, being in the city. Yada yada. 

I've lived in Saint Louis, Detroit, and now a rinky-dink town in Montana so I am no stranger to extremely populated areas with high crime rates, low pay, and extremely populated areas. 

For those of you who were born in Florida, left and then came back, was it something you regretted or were you drawn back and enjoying it?  ",2024-01-18 19:44:01

2588,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, happy",Impact Windows and Low-E gains,"Hi all,

  
We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01
2589,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, happy",Hurricane Prep List.,"1. Charge any device that provides light. Laptops, tablets, cameras, video cameras, and old phones. Old cell phones can still used for dialing 911. Charge external battery backups. ( Glow sticks also provide light for a few hours. Stand them upright in a glass or jar to make a lantern.)
2. Wash all trash cans, big and small, and fill them with water for flushing toilets. Line outdoor trash cans with trash bags, fill them with water and store them in the garage. Add bleach to sterilize. 
3. Fill every tub and sink with water. Cover sinks with Saran Wrap to keep it from collecting dust. Fill the washing machine and leave the lid up to store water.
4. Fill old empty water bottles and other containers with water and keep them near sinks for washing hands. 
5. Fill every Tupperware with water and store it in the freezer. These will help keep food cold longer and serve as a backup water supply. 
6. Fill drinking cups with water and cover with Saran Wrap. Store as many as possible in the fridge. You can store the rest on the counter and use it before opening any water bottles. Ice is impossible to find after the storm.
7. Reserve fridge space for storing tap water and keep the sealed water bottles on the counter. 
8. Cook any meats in advance and other perishable foods. You can freeze cooked food. Hard boil eggs for snacks for the first day without power. 
9. Be well hydrated before the storm hits and avoid salty foods that make you dehydrated. 
10. Wash all dirty clothes and bed sheets. Anything dirty will smell without the A/C, you may need the items, and with no A/C, you'll be sweating a lot. You're going to want clean sheets. 
11. Toss out any expired food, clean cat litter boxes, and empty all trash cans in the house, including bathrooms. Remove anything that will cause an odor when the A/C is off. If you don't have a trash day pickup before the storm, find a dumpster. 
12. Bring in any yard decor, secure anything that will fly around, secure gates, bring in hoses, potted plants, etc. Bring in patio furniture and grills. 
13. Clean your environment so you have clear, easy escape routes. Even if that means temporarily moving furniture to one area. 
14. Scrub all bathrooms so you are starting with a clean odor-free environment. Store water-filled trash cans next to each toilet for flushing. 
15. Place everything you own that is important and necessary in a backpack or small file box that is easy to grab. Include your wallet with ID, phone, hand sanitizer, snacks, etc. Get plastic sleeves for important documents.
16. Make sure you have cash on hand.
17. Stock up on pet food and fill up bowls of water for pets. 
18. Refill any medications. Most insurance companies allow for 2 emergency refills per year.
19. Fill your propane tanks. You can heat soup cans, boil water, make coffee, and other stuff besides just grilling meat. Get an extra, if possible.
20. Drop your A/C in advance and lower temperatures in your fridges. 
21. Gather all candles, flashlights, lighters, matches, batteries, and other items and keep them accessible. 
22. Clean all counters in advance. Start with a clean surface. Buy Clorox Wipes for cleaning when there is no power. Mop your floors and vacuum. If power is out for 10 days, you'll have to live in the mess you started with. 
23. Pick your emergency safe place such as a closet under the stairs. Store the items you'll need in that location for the brunt of the storm. Make a hand fan for when the power is out. 
24. Shower just before the storm is scheduled to hit. 
25. Keep baby wipes next to each toilet. Don't flush them. It's not the time to risk clogging your toilet!
26. Run your dishwasher, don't risk having dirty smelly dishes and you need every container for water! Remember you'll need clean water for brushing your teeth, washing yourself, and cleaning your hands. 
27. Put a small suitcase in your car in case you decide to evacuate. Also, put at least one jug of water in your car. It will still be there if you don't evacuate!  Remember to pack for pets as well. 
28. Check on all family members, set up emergency backup plans, and check on elderly neighbors. 
29. Remember, pets are family too. Take them with you!
30. Before the storm, unplug all electronics. There will be power surges during and after the storm.
31. Gas up your car and have a spare gas container for your generator or your car when you run out.
32 . Use plastic cups and paper plates. 👍  You need water to wash dishes....👎
33 . Also if you run out of water tap your hot water heater it can have up to 30 gallons stored in there.
34 . Put water in balloons and store it in the freezer.
35 . If it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown Flush it down!💩
If you can, take a video of your house and contents....walk room to room--open cabinets/drawers and closets.  This will help if you need to make a claim later.  It will show proof of items and help you list all the items (help your memory, so you don't forget anything)...I highly recommend it!!!
I also heard you should freeze a cup of water, and place a coin on top after it is frozen...keep this in your freezer to help you gauge the temperature if the power goes out.  If the coin stays on top, the food is staying frozen.  If the coin falls into the water, the freezer thawed out and most food will likely need to be thrown away.  This is super helpful is you have to leave and come back, as it may appear everything is still frozen, but if the coin is in the cup--you will know!!",2024-10-09 14:45:24

2591,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, happy",New construction - Are insulated windows worth it?,"Trying to decide between insulated and non-insulated impact low-e windows (alum frames) for our new construction home on the west coast of Florida,  We are about a half mile in from the ocean.  The differences are U:0.52/SHGC:0.26 vs U:1.02/SHGC:0.33.

We will have a lot of windows facing due west and due east catching the full morning and afternoon sun.  The difference is around $4k.  I'm willing to spend that if the extra pane/gas insulating layer will help cut down the heat that comes through the window.  The one wall of the master bedroom is 3 large windows due west.  The top floor is one large family, dining and kitchen area with a lot of west and east windows.

I read that the extra layer also helps cut down on sound.

The brand is ES Windows.  I've seen a ton of these being installed in Miami.  I'm curious what percentage of impact windows being installed in FL are also insulated.



My main concerns are:

1) The extra pane on the outside is not impact.  The windows are still rated for hurricanes.  So it seems like if something is going to hit the window, depending on how big/hard the hit is, the outer layer will break 1st and more easily.  I'm told the outer layer can be replaced by itself. They have to remove the part of the frame (not that's attached to the wall) and they replace just the one pane.  i assume they somehow also refill with gas? At this point, the impact layer is really there just to make insurance happy and protect against the really hard hits.

My biggest fear is surviving a hurricane but every outer pane is broke and the cost of fixing them!

2) I'm also reading that for the full insurance discount one, impact alone is not enough, it needs to be impact AND also hurricane shutters since impact windows are so expensive to replace.  I guess if I do install some form of shutter system, then I don't need to worry about the outer pane anymore, but then what was the point of the inner impact layer!

3) Fogging.  I read this a lot.  Seems like it's a defect or broken window?  Would have to roll the dice on if it's covered by warranty?  Our current rental has insulated impact windows and we have the AC set low and no fogging.  But right now, this time of year, due to the orientation, the main windows don't get much sun. I also installed insulated non-impact windows in another fl addition we built 15 yrs ago and no issues with those and that had large due west windows.  Is the fogging really a serious issue or just a very small very loud minority?

2594,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, happy",Could the AC tech have caused this surge in our electricity bill?,"On August 4th, 2023, an AC tech came out to our apartment to fix a leak in one of our split units. Immediately after his visit, our energy usage readings started to increase substantially. After noticing the surge a few days later, we decided to increase our indoor temp from 70 degrees to 74 to offset the additional usage. Despite that, when our bill came out three weeks later, our bill was $60 more than the previous month. Our bill comparison pulled directly from FPL shows that the average outside temp was the same for the previous and current month but our bill still increased. 

Before anyone suggests that it increased because our temp was set to so low, I’d like to clarify that our AC was at 70-71 degrees for the previous two months where we paid $109-$115 for each one despite the summer heat. This time our bill was $171 and FPL identified the average outside temp as the same for BOTH months (previous and current). In the daily usage report, there’s a clear spike the day of/after the tech visit on August 4th that maintains throughout the rest of the period. After sharing this with management, they had an electrician come out, but all he did was turn the AC temperature down to 65 while he took readings from the circuit box before leaving since he was not able to communicate with us in English. Is it possible that this was caused by the AC tech when he visited on August 4th? What should my next steps be? I don’t want to continue paying more for electricity if unnecessary but management continues to blame it on the summer heat and raised FPL rates which I'm almost certain happened before July. We only have a 1bd apartment with no children. Just my bf and I.

I keep my central AC at 73°. And my unit can mostly keep up and keep my home at around 76° during hot days. But yesterday was very hot. And my homes temperature were at 80°. Last year I experienced similar temps during the hottest days of the year in September. But seeing how we're in May and already experiencing super hot days. I figured I need to do something about this.

Anyways my central AC unit has no issues. It's a few years old. Filters are clean. Indoor and outdoor condenser and radiators are clean. Its my mistake for not ordering a larger unit knowing how summers get here in Florida. 

A new central unit is very expensive. Rather than spend several thousands of dollars to replace mine. I was thinking I can install a window unit to help my central AC cool my home more quickly. — at least as a temporary solution as I set aside funds to eventually replace the central AC unit.

For anyone that currently has a similar setup.

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60’s?) single pane windows. I’m still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7° temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, “ewww. 80s? You lizard. 🦎“ ... Lol, the room is around 78° and is a completely uninsulated 1970’s porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I’m thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

2611,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, annoyed",Impact Windows and Low-E gains,"Hi all,

  
We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01
2612,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, annoyed",Hurricane Prep List.,"1. Charge any device that provides light. Laptops, tablets, cameras, video cameras, and old phones. Old cell phones can still used for dialing 911. Charge external battery backups. ( Glow sticks also provide light for a few hours. Stand them upright in a glass or jar to make a lantern.)
2. Wash all trash cans, big and small, and fill them with water for flushing toilets. Line outdoor trash cans with trash bags, fill them with water and store them in the garage. Add bleach to sterilize. 
3. Fill every tub and sink with water. Cover sinks with Saran Wrap to keep it from collecting dust. Fill the washing machine and leave the lid up to store water.
4. Fill old empty water bottles and other containers with water and keep them near sinks for washing hands. 
5. Fill every Tupperware with water and store it in the freezer. These will help keep food cold longer and serve as a backup water supply. 
6. Fill drinking cups with water and cover with Saran Wrap. Store as many as possible in the fridge. You can store the rest on the counter and use it before opening any water bottles. Ice is impossible to find after the storm.
7. Reserve fridge space for storing tap water and keep the sealed water bottles on the counter. 
8. Cook any meats in advance and other perishable foods. You can freeze cooked food. Hard boil eggs for snacks for the first day without power. 
9. Be well hydrated before the storm hits and avoid salty foods that make you dehydrated. 
10. Wash all dirty clothes and bed sheets. Anything dirty will smell without the A/C, you may need the items, and with no A/C, you'll be sweating a lot. You're going to want clean sheets. 
11. Toss out any expired food, clean cat litter boxes, and empty all trash cans in the house, including bathrooms. Remove anything that will cause an odor when the A/C is off. If you don't have a trash day pickup before the storm, find a dumpster. 
12. Bring in any yard decor, secure anything that will fly around, secure gates, bring in hoses, potted plants, etc. Bring in patio furniture and grills. 
13. Clean your environment so you have clear, easy escape routes. Even if that means temporarily moving furniture to one area. 
14. Scrub all bathrooms so you are starting with a clean odor-free environment. Store water-filled trash cans next to each toilet for flushing. 
15. Place everything you own that is important and necessary in a backpack or small file box that is easy to grab. Include your wallet with ID, phone, hand sanitizer, snacks, etc. Get plastic sleeves for important documents.
16. Make sure you have cash on hand.
17. Stock up on pet food and fill up bowls of water for pets. 
18. Refill any medications. Most insurance companies allow for 2 emergency refills per year.
19. Fill your propane tanks. You can heat soup cans, boil water, make coffee, and other stuff besides just grilling meat. Get an extra, if possible.
20. Drop your A/C in advance and lower temperatures in your fridges. 
21. Gather all candles, flashlights, lighters, matches, batteries, and other items and keep them accessible. 
22. Clean all counters in advance. Start with a clean surface. Buy Clorox Wipes for cleaning when there is no power. Mop your floors and vacuum. If power is out for 10 days, you'll have to live in the mess you started with. 
23. Pick your emergency safe place such as a closet under the stairs. Store the items you'll need in that location for the brunt of the storm. Make a hand fan for when the power is out. 
24. Shower just before the storm is scheduled to hit. 
25. Keep baby wipes next to each toilet. Don't flush them. It's not the time to risk clogging your toilet!
26. Run your dishwasher, don't risk having dirty smelly dishes and you need every container for water! Remember you'll need clean water for brushing your teeth, washing yourself, and cleaning your hands. 
27. Put a small suitcase in your car in case you decide to evacuate. Also, put at least one jug of water in your car. It will still be there if you don't evacuate!  Remember to pack for pets as well. 
28. Check on all family members, set up emergency backup plans, and check on elderly neighbors. 
29. Remember, pets are family too. Take them with you!
30. Before the storm, unplug all electronics. There will be power surges during and after the storm.
31. Gas up your car and have a spare gas container for your generator or your car when you run out.
32 . Use plastic cups and paper plates. 👍  You need water to wash dishes....👎
33 . Also if you run out of water tap your hot water heater it can have up to 30 gallons stored in there.
34 . Put water in balloons and store it in the freezer.
35 . If it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown Flush it down!💩
If you can, take a video of your house and contents....walk room to room--open cabinets/drawers and closets.  This will help if you need to make a claim later.  It will show proof of items and help you list all the items (help your memory, so you don't forget anything)...I highly recommend it!!!
I also heard you should freeze a cup of water, and place a coin on top after it is frozen...keep this in your freezer to help you gauge the temperature if the power goes out.  If the coin stays on top, the food is staying frozen.  If the coin falls into the water, the freezer thawed out and most food will likely need to be thrown away.  This is super helpful is you have to leave and come back, as it may appear everything is still frozen, but if the coin is in the cup--you will know!!",2024-10-09 14:45:24

2616,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, annoyed",Could the AC tech have caused this surge in our electricity bill?,"On August 4th, 2023, an AC tech came out to our apartment to fix a leak in one of our split units. Immediately after his visit, our energy usage readings started to increase substantially. After noticing the surge a few days later, we decided to increase our indoor temp from 70 degrees to 74 to offset the additional usage. Despite that, when our bill came out three weeks later, our bill was $60 more than the previous month. Our bill comparison pulled directly from FPL shows that the average outside temp was the same for the previous and current month but our bill still increased. 

Before anyone suggests that it increased because our temp was set to so low, I’d like to clarify that our AC was at 70-71 degrees for the previous two months where we paid $109-$115 for each one despite the summer heat. This time our bill was $171 and FPL identified the average outside temp as the same for BOTH months (previous and current). In the daily usage report, there’s a clear spike the day of/after the tech visit on August 4th that maintains throughout the rest of the period. After sharing this with management, they had an electrician come out, but all he did was turn the AC temperature down to 65 while he took readings from the circuit box before leaving since he was not able to communicate with us in English. Is it possible that this was caused by the AC tech when he visited on August 4th? What should my next steps be? I don’t want to continue paying more for electricity if unnecessary but management continues to blame it on the summer heat and raised FPL rates which I'm almost certain happened before July. We only have a 1bd apartment with no children. Just my bf and I.

I keep my central AC at 73°. And my unit can mostly keep up and keep my home at around 76° during hot days. But yesterday was very hot. And my homes temperature were at 80°. Last year I experienced similar temps during the hottest days of the year in September. But seeing how we're in May and already experiencing super hot days. I figured I need to do something about this.

Anyways my central AC unit has no issues. It's a few years old. Filters are clean. Indoor and outdoor condenser and radiators are clean. Its my mistake for not ordering a larger unit knowing how summers get here in Florida. 

A new central unit is very expensive. Rather than spend several thousands of dollars to replace mine. I was thinking I can install a window unit to help my central AC cool my home more quickly. — at least as a temporary solution as I set aside funds to eventually replace the central AC unit.

For anyone that currently has a similar setup.

With heatwaves relentless, it's hard to withstand,
The sun's burning rays, they cause quite a fright,
It's the most horrible time, try as we might.

There'll be sweat-soaked shirts and sunburned skin,

As the heat engulfs, it feels like a sin,
No relief in sight, just oppressive heat,
It's the most horrible time, it can't be beat.

The air conditioner hums, working overtime,
But it's a battle lost against the summertime,
Muggy and stifling, the air feels heavy,
In this sweltering season, it's hard to be merry.

There'll be wilted flowers and dried-up lawns,

As the heat persists, nature's beauty is gone,
Unrelenting humidity clings to the air,
It's the most horrible time, with little to spare.

The beaches are crowded, seeking some respite,
But the scorching sand makes walking a fight,
Sunscreen and shade can only do so much,
In this unbearable heat, there's no gentle touch.

It's the most horrible time of the year, indeed,
With temperatures soaring, it's a challenging feat,

We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01
2637,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, comfortable",Hurricane Prep List.,"1. Charge any device that provides light. Laptops, tablets, cameras, video cameras, and old phones. Old cell phones can still used for dialing 911. Charge external battery backups. ( Glow sticks also provide light for a few hours. Stand them upright in a glass or jar to make a lantern.)
2. Wash all trash cans, big and small, and fill them with water for flushing toilets. Line outdoor trash cans with trash bags, fill them with water and store them in the garage. Add bleach to sterilize. 
3. Fill every tub and sink with water. Cover sinks with Saran Wrap to keep it from collecting dust. Fill the washing machine and leave the lid up to store water.
4. Fill old empty water bottles and other containers with water and keep them near sinks for washing hands. 
5. Fill every Tupperware with water and store it in the freezer. These will help keep food cold longer and serve as a backup water supply. 
6. Fill drinking cups with water and cover with Saran Wrap. Store as many as possible in the fridge. You can store the rest on the counter and use it before opening any water bottles. Ice is impossible to find after the storm.
7. Reserve fridge space for storing tap water and keep the sealed water bottles on the counter. 
8. Cook any meats in advance and other perishable foods. You can freeze cooked food. Hard boil eggs for snacks for the first day without power. 
9. Be well hydrated before the storm hits and avoid salty foods that make you dehydrated. 
10. Wash all dirty clothes and bed sheets. Anything dirty will smell without the A/C, you may need the items, and with no A/C, you'll be sweating a lot. You're going to want clean sheets. 
11. Toss out any expired food, clean cat litter boxes, and empty all trash cans in the house, including bathrooms. Remove anything that will cause an odor when the A/C is off. If you don't have a trash day pickup before the storm, find a dumpster. 
12. Bring in any yard decor, secure anything that will fly around, secure gates, bring in hoses, potted plants, etc. Bring in patio furniture and grills. 
13. Clean your environment so you have clear, easy escape routes. Even if that means temporarily moving furniture to one area. 
14. Scrub all bathrooms so you are starting with a clean odor-free environment. Store water-filled trash cans next to each toilet for flushing. 
15. Place everything you own that is important and necessary in a backpack or small file box that is easy to grab. Include your wallet with ID, phone, hand sanitizer, snacks, etc. Get plastic sleeves for important documents.
16. Make sure you have cash on hand.
17. Stock up on pet food and fill up bowls of water for pets. 
18. Refill any medications. Most insurance companies allow for 2 emergency refills per year.
19. Fill your propane tanks. You can heat soup cans, boil water, make coffee, and other stuff besides just grilling meat. Get an extra, if possible.
20. Drop your A/C in advance and lower temperatures in your fridges. 
21. Gather all candles, flashlights, lighters, matches, batteries, and other items and keep them accessible. 
22. Clean all counters in advance. Start with a clean surface. Buy Clorox Wipes for cleaning when there is no power. Mop your floors and vacuum. If power is out for 10 days, you'll have to live in the mess you started with. 
23. Pick your emergency safe place such as a closet under the stairs. Store the items you'll need in that location for the brunt of the storm. Make a hand fan for when the power is out. 
24. Shower just before the storm is scheduled to hit. 
25. Keep baby wipes next to each toilet. Don't flush them. It's not the time to risk clogging your toilet!
26. Run your dishwasher, don't risk having dirty smelly dishes and you need every container for water! Remember you'll need clean water for brushing your teeth, washing yourself, and cleaning your hands. 
27. Put a small suitcase in your car in case you decide to evacuate. Also, put at least one jug of water in your car. It will still be there if you don't evacuate!  Remember to pack for pets as well. 
28. Check on all family members, set up emergency backup plans, and check on elderly neighbors. 
29. Remember, pets are family too. Take them with you!
30. Before the storm, unplug all electronics. There will be power surges during and after the storm.
31. Gas up your car and have a spare gas container for your generator or your car when you run out.
32 . Use plastic cups and paper plates. 👍  You need water to wash dishes....👎
33 . Also if you run out of water tap your hot water heater it can have up to 30 gallons stored in there.
34 . Put water in balloons and store it in the freezer.
35 . If it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown Flush it down!💩
If you can, take a video of your house and contents....walk room to room--open cabinets/drawers and closets.  This will help if you need to make a claim later.  It will show proof of items and help you list all the items (help your memory, so you don't forget anything)...I highly recommend it!!!
I also heard you should freeze a cup of water, and place a coin on top after it is frozen...keep this in your freezer to help you gauge the temperature if the power goes out.  If the coin stays on top, the food is staying frozen.  If the coin falls into the water, the freezer thawed out and most food will likely need to be thrown away.  This is super helpful is you have to leave and come back, as it may appear everything is still frozen, but if the coin is in the cup--you will know!!",2024-10-09 14:45:24

I've been a Florida resident my whole life but this is my first post here so please be kind 😅. I'm hoping a fellow Floridian familiar with generators/inverters might could help.

So my husband and I live in Crawfordville and, like I'm sure most of you've heard, we're set to have a pretty active hurricane season this year and tbh I'm wanting to get prepared asap-I'm wanting to avoid having to move with our animals.

The issue is that we have a hedgehog and a gecko-both of which require electricity/heat to live comfortably (we also have cats but they're fine without power lol). My immediate thought is to invest in a generator/inverter but I know very little about them. 

At minimum we'd need something that can keep a 24 watt UVB linear bulb, a 25 watt incandescent bulb, and two 150 watt heat emitters running in order for our small animals to be comfortable. I'm not too concerned about the fridge although it would be nice to have something to keep it running too (I can't really find the starting/running watts anywhere in the manual so I'm unsure as to how much power it consumes (it's an old Kenmore from Sears-model #253 74802409)).

Is there anything out there that could give us what we need? I was looking into Jackery power stations but I dont think one would be powerful enough to handle everything-I may just get one to run random small appliances/charge phones.

2641,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, comfortable",Could the AC tech have caused this surge in our electricity bill?,"On August 4th, 2023, an AC tech came out to our apartment to fix a leak in one of our split units. Immediately after his visit, our energy usage readings started to increase substantially. After noticing the surge a few days later, we decided to increase our indoor temp from 70 degrees to 74 to offset the additional usage. Despite that, when our bill came out three weeks later, our bill was $60 more than the previous month. Our bill comparison pulled directly from FPL shows that the average outside temp was the same for the previous and current month but our bill still increased. 

Before anyone suggests that it increased because our temp was set to so low, I’d like to clarify that our AC was at 70-71 degrees for the previous two months where we paid $109-$115 for each one despite the summer heat. This time our bill was $171 and FPL identified the average outside temp as the same for BOTH months (previous and current). In the daily usage report, there’s a clear spike the day of/after the tech visit on August 4th that maintains throughout the rest of the period. After sharing this with management, they had an electrician come out, but all he did was turn the AC temperature down to 65 while he took readings from the circuit box before leaving since he was not able to communicate with us in English. Is it possible that this was caused by the AC tech when he visited on August 4th? What should my next steps be? I don’t want to continue paying more for electricity if unnecessary but management continues to blame it on the summer heat and raised FPL rates which I'm almost certain happened before July. We only have a 1bd apartment with no children. Just my bf and I.

I keep my central AC at 73°. And my unit can mostly keep up and keep my home at around 76° during hot days. But yesterday was very hot. And my homes temperature were at 80°. Last year I experienced similar temps during the hottest days of the year in September. But seeing how we're in May and already experiencing super hot days. I figured I need to do something about this.

Anyways my central AC unit has no issues. It's a few years old. Filters are clean. Indoor and outdoor condenser and radiators are clean. Its my mistake for not ordering a larger unit knowing how summers get here in Florida. 

A new central unit is very expensive. Rather than spend several thousands of dollars to replace mine. I was thinking I can install a window unit to help my central AC cool my home more quickly. — at least as a temporary solution as I set aside funds to eventually replace the central AC unit.

For anyone that currently has a similar setup.

1. The stairs leading up to the second floor rooms are shaky and you have to use the handrails to not fall.  However, the handrails have broken and chipped paint that hurt your hands and are rusting.  Even the property manager told us she doesn't like going up and down those stairs.

2.  The drain in the hot tub looks like it spent the last 20 years under water on a ship wreck.  It was so rusted, we did not feel comfortable using it.

3.  The swimming pool and the heated mineral pool were filthy.  We actually used the skimmer to try to clean the mineral pool ourselves, but once we got in, we saw all the scum on the tiles and quickly got out.

4.  The towels were stained and had large rips.

5.  The wifi and TV service never worked the entire time we were there.

6.  Our plans changed and we needed to leave a day early.  I talked to the property manager and she said she would change the reservation and refund us what we had paid for the last night of the stay that we wouldn't be using.  We left by 10am that morning so they had plenty of time to clean the room and prepare it for someone else.  It turned out that she lied and never gave us the refund.  When we complained afterwards through Expedia's customer service, they tried contacting the property but could not get approval for the refund so we ended up paying over $300 for a night in a room we didn't use even after being assured that wouldn't happen.

7.  The nice and quiet atmosphere is now ruined by a bar that is directly adjacent to the property.  Our room was on the opposite side of the property but we still could hear the customers and the music through the walls until after 2am each night.

8.  One of the ""features"" they mention is that you are within view of the historical Flagler Beach pier.  They don't mention it was badly damaged in a storm over 2 years ago and has not been repaired and is just boarded up.  The last section of it looks like it will fall into the ocean anytime now.

9.  One of the two mornings we were there, we came down for breakfast and were told that the cook just didn't show up that day so our bed and breakfast had no breakfast but no compensation was offered for this.10.  The waitress was telling us private stuff about other staff members like a cracked skull during a fight with her boyfriend.  That isn't the story you want to hear on your romantic anniversary trip and should have been told to the police instead or out of town customers.

Overall, this place is poorly managed, not maintained and way overpriced for what you are getting.  I highly recommend avoiding it and if you have reservations already, cancel them and then monitor your credit card to make sure they don't charge you anyway.",2024-04-12 13:42:02

I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60’s?) single pane windows. I’m still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7° temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, “ewww. 80s? You lizard. 🦎“ ... Lol, the room is around 78° and is a completely uninsulated 1970’s porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I’m thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

This is a problem as I come back from walking the dog (doesn't matter what time of day) soaking wet. 

I used to love gardening, hiking, & just generally being outside, but now all I want to do is hide in the A/C from May through January. 

If anyone has any advice/tips/strategies for actually getting used to this climate, I'd really appreciate it. 

Having said that, please don't reply with ""Oh, you'll get used to it"" or ""Gee, it doesn't bother me"" because after three years, I haven't & it does. (I mean that sincerely, I'm not trying to be snarky.)

The owner of my company has an RV he’s imploring us to take for a few days to enjoy before he sells it. I’m due for a very relaxing vacation and I’d love to take advantage of the opportunity. I’m in Broward and what I’m looking for is something by some water, preferably with a ton of tree coverage where I can park the RV and set up a couple chairs outside to not bake in direct heat. 

My boss went to a newer RV park by the Keys recently and looking at the pics, it was entirely exposed without any trees aside from the occasional tiny palm between lots. That wasn’t appealing at all to me as they had to spend the entire time IN the RV due to the direct sunlight. 

I’d love to be able to get some snorkeling in but outside of that, I’m not looking for a ton of things to do as I need this vacation to be as chilled out as possible. Ideally I’ll be getting some snorkeling done during the day then sitting by the RV with a guitar for the rest of the night relaxing.

We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them.

2670,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunlight, enjoy",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

2681,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunlight, annoying",Impact Windows and Low-E gains,"Hi all,

  
We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19

I visited a few times on vacation, and I kind of fell in love with it. Yes, I know vacation and living there are two different things, (I’ve been reading about housing prices, the problems with insurance companies and flooding) but it was awesome. I’m currently from the Midwest (tornado alley), and although I love my home, I’m tired of the cold winters and being landlocked. When we went to Florida, it was in the summer, it was warm, I loved all the different kinds of wildlife, vegetation, and your always close to the beach (2 hours compared to at least 12 for me). There were so many different kinds of lizards, and colorful birds, different kinds of plants, and you could see dolphins swimming from the beach, granted you could only see then fins but it was awesome. The only time I can see lizards, or cool birds is at the pet store or the zoo, and I loved the cypress trees, we don’t have anything like that here.

But I’ve never been to Hawaii, and I’m curious how those beaches compare.For those who have experienced both, how do Hawaii’s top beaches like Lanikai, Waikiki, and Ka’anapali stack up against Florida’s Gulf Coast? I love the calm, family-friendly vibes of Florida’s beaches, but I keep hearing about the beauty and serenity of Hawaii’s beaches.

Siesta Key: Known for its ultra-fine white quartz sand and calm waters.

Destin: Famous for emerald-green waters and soft sand.

Panama City Beach: A long stretch of sandy shore with warm, clear water and plenty of activities.

2707,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, warm, love",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05
2708,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, warm, love","In memoriam of u/realjd, friend, mod, father, and amazing person.","About a month ago, we lost one of our own, fellow mod and friend u/realjd, long before his time. He leaves behind a wife and young son, and a tremendous hole in the hearts of the countless people who's lives he touched. We wanted to share some thoughts, and allow those users who knew him to do so as well. In no particular order:

u/the_lamou: JD was an amazing human being who truly loved people -- all people, regardless of who they were or if he agreed with them or what their circumstances are. He always, without fail, saw the best in everyone. And he made us want to see the best in everyone, too, because he saw the best in us and was just such a great guy that you didn't want to disappoint him. He really cared. He always had time to help. He always wanted to help. He was the heart and soul of the mod team, and he was taken from us too soon. This sub, redddit as a whole, and the world is a lesser place without him in it.

u/razzertto: Our friend and mod extraordinaire JD, passed away recently after a short illness. To say he was “one of the mods” does so little justice to what he was to all of us on r/florida; he was the glue, the soul, the mensch, the guy that we all relied on. He encouraged the mod team to always find the good in everyone and to assume the best intent. He loved hearing both sides of an argument and always wanted to be fair; he built bridges even when the curmudgeons amongst us were less generous.

JD donated time, effort, talent, and money to make the world better. He was caring and kind; the first person to offer to help and the last person to give up on someone or something. He embodied the idea that no man is an island, and each of us is part of the main.

Offline, JD said yes to life! He was always trying new things and visiting new places. He loved his wife and son with all that he had. He was funny and the first to get in on a good joke or gentle prank. He spent his days doting on his son, gaming with him, and taking him on adventures.

He is deeply missed. The bell will toll for us all someday, but today, it tolls for JD.

u/heathersaur: James was the type of person who loved life. He was a hard person to not like and was persistently, infectiously happy. He loved his family and friends. He loved meeting new people and making new friends every where he went. He loved Florida and all it had to offer and he gave his heart and soul to his communities.

James was a true-blooded Florida Man - t-shirt, shorts, and flip-flops (if required). He loved his little home near the beach, he loved the Lagoon, the rivers, the springs, and all of Florida's beautiful nature. Despite all it's faults, he loved his State of Florida, and dedicated so much of his time and energy to make it a better place for all of us.

He loved his Reddit communities and the bonds he formed from them. He was passionate about ensuring our subreddits were a place for our towns and cities to gather and share information, from the latest Pub Sub sale to Hurricane safety information.

His passing has left a gaping hole on our mod team and in our lives. Our hearts ache for the friend we lost and his beautiful family he left behind.

We know his larger than life personality will live on, through us, through his incredible wife and son, and through our communities.

We will make you proud James.

u/iamdeirdre: ReadJD was an amazing human being. He freely gave his help, time, encouragement, and enthusiasm to his friends, and his community!

JD and I lived on opposite sides of Florida, and every time a hurricane started to roll my way he would offer us a room. When I was overwhelmed by my subreddit, he was one of the awesome Florida mods that came aboard to help me wrangle it back into a decent place.

James was always a voice of reason, when people would send Modmails, he would really try to help people out, he always saw the best in people.

James was warm, and funny. He talked so lovingly about his wife, and especially about his son. One of our last conversations was about him setting up a special Minecraft server for his boy, he was really excited to get to play together.

When I made an attempt at raising money for St. Jude's Children's Hospital by streaming for Extra Life, James donated over $100, despite the fact that I'm a terrible streamer. I almost cried when I saw that.

James and I both were on the Mod Council, he really wanted to make things better for his fellow mods. He also tried to make life better in his home community by volunteering his time to a local politician he believed in.

u/realjd was a lovely human being, and I feel lucky that I got to be his friend for a few years, I wish it could have been longer.

u/RallyX26: I struggle to find the words to describe the loss of JD. As others before me have so eloquently stated, he was an incredible person to know and was such an inspiration to everyone around him. He inspired us all to be better people, not by force or by shame, but by example. He truly saw the good in everyone, he put the needs and betterment of everyone else above himself at all times, and he had a passion for volunteering that made the world a better place. He loved his family, he loved his community, and he loved his God. He was kind, he was loving, and he was selfless. He will be... He is... deeply missed.

Our thoughts go out to his family.

**Note:** This should go without saying but nevertheless it will be said -- this thread is going to be vigilantly monitored. Any disrespect, any threadjacking, any bullshit whatsoever evaluated solely at our judgement will result in a permanent ban and a referral for further action to the admins, many of whom knew JD personally and were quite fond of him.

You know, one of the best things about living in Florida is the warm climate. It’s pretty amazing to enjoy sunshine almost all year round, especially if you’re someone who prefers mild winters. And let’s not forget about the stunning beaches! There’s nothing like having beautiful stretches of sand right at your fingertips for relaxing or engaging in water sports.

Another major perk is that Florida doesn’t have a state income tax, which is a nice way to keep more of your hard-earned money. Plus, the cultural diversity here is fantastic. You can experience a vibrant mix of festivals, cuisines, and traditions from all over the world.

If you love the outdoors, you’re in for a treat! There are endless opportunities for hiking, fishing, boating, and golfing. And the natural beauty? Wow! Florida is home to unique ecosystems, including the breathtaking Everglades, and the wildlife is truly something to behold.

Let’s not forget about the world-class attractions, like Walt Disney World and Universal Studios, which provide endless entertainment for people of all ages. Lastly, if you’re thinking about retirement, Florida has a ton of active retirement communities that cater to those looking for a lively lifestyle in a warm setting. 

Sure, there’s a lot to bitch about. 

All in all, it’s a pretty appealing place to call home!",2024-10-06 12:29:11

2714,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, warm, love",Thinking about moving to Florida from Montana.,"Don't get me wrong, Montana is an absolutely gorgeous state with views that don't compare to many other places. However, I was born and raised in Florida, moved out of the state almost a decade ago now and every year I think about moving back but I am afraid of only being drawn back by nostalgia. I was raised in Pasco County, to give you an idea of where I'm from. I had no choice but to move, seeing as I was a minor at the time but now that I am financially stable and have nothing tying me down I've been toying with the idea to move back. I hate the winters, the snow is absolutely awful and just this last week it was -38 here in Montana. I have no love for snow sports, I love the heat and the humidity is something I'm used to. I would much rather do warm activities such as exploring, boating, hiking, and things of that nature. 

The main reason I want to move back to Florida is all my siblings live there with their kids, I am very family oriented and want to be involved in their lives. I know it's gotten far more expensive to live, but I am also moving from a place where a 1bd/1bath costs about 2,000$ a month. Car insurance here is cheap but car registration is not. Food prices are insane, but gas prices are low currently. Not to mention, the harsh conditions of the roads and the snow causes ware and tear on your vehicle. Within two months of living in Montana I had accumulated two cracks in my windshield and I stay far behind others while driving. All this to say, I am not very happy here.  Also Montana is very isolated with their cities, you have to drive at least two hours to get to another 'big' city. I like populated areas, being in the city. Yada yada. 

I've lived in Saint Louis, Detroit, and now a rinky-dink town in Montana so I am no stranger to extremely populated areas with high crime rates, low pay, and extremely populated areas. 

For those of you who were born in Florida, left and then came back, was it something you regretted or were you drawn back and enjoying it?  ",2024-01-18 19:44:01

We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01

Several adults, one elderly man, and some children. None of my family is familiar with FL at all, and I've never even been there. I'm here to see if anyone has any suggestions of what places I should look at, given our wishlist, which is fairly short:  
1) Warm/hot in February. I naively assumed the entire state would fit the bill here, but was recently told by someone that that is not the case. Ideally, it would be sufficiently warm to enter the ocean/swim in a pool in Feb. Does that limit me to only south FL?  
2) Walkable urban core. My father no longer drives and wants to be able to walk around to, you know, shops, restaurants, bars, that type of thing. I have read that these are rare in FL, but basically we don't want to rent a house in a suburb and have to drive everywhere. It doesn't have to be a major downtown (although it could be), but any type of that mini-downtown/touristy area. It's fine if it is touristy, since we'll be tourists!  
3) Near the coast. We probably can't afford to rent a place directly on the coast, but ideally we'd be walkable to a beach, or at least a short drive/bike ride. So, basically not central FL.

I love the warm weather and not dealing having to wear a jacket and dealing with snow. What does everyone think?",2024-01-29 17:39:56
2742,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, warm, hate",Thinking about moving to Florida from Montana.,"Don't get me wrong, Montana is an absolutely gorgeous state with views that don't compare to many other places. However, I was born and raised in Florida, moved out of the state almost a decade ago now and every year I think about moving back but I am afraid of only being drawn back by nostalgia. I was raised in Pasco County, to give you an idea of where I'm from. I had no choice but to move, seeing as I was a minor at the time but now that I am financially stable and have nothing tying me down I've been toying with the idea to move back. I hate the winters, the snow is absolutely awful and just this last week it was -38 here in Montana. I have no love for snow sports, I love the heat and the humidity is something I'm used to. I would much rather do warm activities such as exploring, boating, hiking, and things of that nature. 

The main reason I want to move back to Florida is all my siblings live there with their kids, I am very family oriented and want to be involved in their lives. I know it's gotten far more expensive to live, but I am also moving from a place where a 1bd/1bath costs about 2,000$ a month. Car insurance here is cheap but car registration is not. Food prices are insane, but gas prices are low currently. Not to mention, the harsh conditions of the roads and the snow causes ware and tear on your vehicle. Within two months of living in Montana I had accumulated two cracks in my windshield and I stay far behind others while driving. All this to say, I am not very happy here.  Also Montana is very isolated with their cities, you have to drive at least two hours to get to another 'big' city. I like populated areas, being in the city. Yada yada. 

I've lived in Saint Louis, Detroit, and now a rinky-dink town in Montana so I am no stranger to extremely populated areas with high crime rates, low pay, and extremely populated areas. 

For those of you who were born in Florida, left and then came back, was it something you regretted or were you drawn back and enjoying it?  ",2024-01-18 19:44:01

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19

Any peer reviewed studies that provide evidence contrary to what seems to be a consensus of scientists around the world?

I understand that people make this a political issue, but I find it hard to believe that thousands of people around the world are in on a conspiracy to push some agenda with action on climate change.

Then you see proposals like Project 2025 that seem hellbent on accelerating climate change and I just really don't understand the thought process.

Do you actually believe this? Are you just trying to own the Libs? Willful ignorance?

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05
2757,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, warm, enjoy",Why are so many people on this subReddit just negative? ,"
You know, one of the best things about living in Florida is the warm climate. It’s pretty amazing to enjoy sunshine almost all year round, especially if you’re someone who prefers mild winters. And let’s not forget about the stunning beaches! There’s nothing like having beautiful stretches of sand right at your fingertips for relaxing or engaging in water sports.

Another major perk is that Florida doesn’t have a state income tax, which is a nice way to keep more of your hard-earned money. Plus, the cultural diversity here is fantastic. You can experience a vibrant mix of festivals, cuisines, and traditions from all over the world.

If you love the outdoors, you’re in for a treat! There are endless opportunities for hiking, fishing, boating, and golfing. And the natural beauty? Wow! Florida is home to unique ecosystems, including the breathtaking Everglades, and the wildlife is truly something to behold.

Let’s not forget about the world-class attractions, like Walt Disney World and Universal Studios, which provide endless entertainment for people of all ages. Lastly, if you’re thinking about retirement, Florida has a ton of active retirement communities that cater to those looking for a lively lifestyle in a warm setting. 

Sure, there’s a lot to bitch about. 

All in all, it’s a pretty appealing place to call home!",2024-10-06 12:29:11
2758,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, warm, enjoy",Thinking about moving to Florida from Montana.,"Don't get me wrong, Montana is an absolutely gorgeous state with views that don't compare to many other places. However, I was born and raised in Florida, moved out of the state almost a decade ago now and every year I think about moving back but I am afraid of only being drawn back by nostalgia. I was raised in Pasco County, to give you an idea of where I'm from. I had no choice but to move, seeing as I was a minor at the time but now that I am financially stable and have nothing tying me down I've been toying with the idea to move back. I hate the winters, the snow is absolutely awful and just this last week it was -38 here in Montana. I have no love for snow sports, I love the heat and the humidity is something I'm used to. I would much rather do warm activities such as exploring, boating, hiking, and things of that nature. 

The main reason I want to move back to Florida is all my siblings live there with their kids, I am very family oriented and want to be involved in their lives. I know it's gotten far more expensive to live, but I am also moving from a place where a 1bd/1bath costs about 2,000$ a month. Car insurance here is cheap but car registration is not. Food prices are insane, but gas prices are low currently. Not to mention, the harsh conditions of the roads and the snow causes ware and tear on your vehicle. Within two months of living in Montana I had accumulated two cracks in my windshield and I stay far behind others while driving. All this to say, I am not very happy here.  Also Montana is very isolated with their cities, you have to drive at least two hours to get to another 'big' city. I like populated areas, being in the city. Yada yada. 

I've lived in Saint Louis, Detroit, and now a rinky-dink town in Montana so I am no stranger to extremely populated areas with high crime rates, low pay, and extremely populated areas. 

For those of you who were born in Florida, left and then came back, was it something you regretted or were you drawn back and enjoying it?  ",2024-01-18 19:44:01

Please give me some advice! I would really like to go to Florida but maybe it's better to visit some other time of year?

I want to update you with my new plans to visit your country. I got very many tips in the open comments and also in the privates. Link to the post before below.

https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/s/zPy0XbmLln

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19

Any peer reviewed studies that provide evidence contrary to what seems to be a consensus of scientists around the world?

I understand that people make this a political issue, but I find it hard to believe that thousands of people around the world are in on a conspiracy to push some agenda with action on climate change.

Then you see proposals like Project 2025 that seem hellbent on accelerating climate change and I just really don't understand the thought process.

Do you actually believe this? Are you just trying to own the Libs? Willful ignorance?

UPDATE: Looks like this discussion has run its course. The 2 most widely given responses were ""a study 60 years ago was wrong, so it must all be fake"" and that ""Hollywood actors, China and india aren't doing anything, why should I""

2796,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, warm, happy","In memoriam of u/realjd, friend, mod, father, and amazing person.","About a month ago, we lost one of our own, fellow mod and friend u/realjd, long before his time. He leaves behind a wife and young son, and a tremendous hole in the hearts of the countless people who's lives he touched. We wanted to share some thoughts, and allow those users who knew him to do so as well. In no particular order:

u/the_lamou: JD was an amazing human being who truly loved people -- all people, regardless of who they were or if he agreed with them or what their circumstances are. He always, without fail, saw the best in everyone. And he made us want to see the best in everyone, too, because he saw the best in us and was just such a great guy that you didn't want to disappoint him. He really cared. He always had time to help. He always wanted to help. He was the heart and soul of the mod team, and he was taken from us too soon. This sub, redddit as a whole, and the world is a lesser place without him in it.

u/razzertto: Our friend and mod extraordinaire JD, passed away recently after a short illness. To say he was “one of the mods” does so little justice to what he was to all of us on r/florida; he was the glue, the soul, the mensch, the guy that we all relied on. He encouraged the mod team to always find the good in everyone and to assume the best intent. He loved hearing both sides of an argument and always wanted to be fair; he built bridges even when the curmudgeons amongst us were less generous.

JD donated time, effort, talent, and money to make the world better. He was caring and kind; the first person to offer to help and the last person to give up on someone or something. He embodied the idea that no man is an island, and each of us is part of the main.

Offline, JD said yes to life! He was always trying new things and visiting new places. He loved his wife and son with all that he had. He was funny and the first to get in on a good joke or gentle prank. He spent his days doting on his son, gaming with him, and taking him on adventures.

He is deeply missed. The bell will toll for us all someday, but today, it tolls for JD.

u/heathersaur: James was the type of person who loved life. He was a hard person to not like and was persistently, infectiously happy. He loved his family and friends. He loved meeting new people and making new friends every where he went. He loved Florida and all it had to offer and he gave his heart and soul to his communities.

James was a true-blooded Florida Man - t-shirt, shorts, and flip-flops (if required). He loved his little home near the beach, he loved the Lagoon, the rivers, the springs, and all of Florida's beautiful nature. Despite all it's faults, he loved his State of Florida, and dedicated so much of his time and energy to make it a better place for all of us.

He loved his Reddit communities and the bonds he formed from them. He was passionate about ensuring our subreddits were a place for our towns and cities to gather and share information, from the latest Pub Sub sale to Hurricane safety information.

His passing has left a gaping hole on our mod team and in our lives. Our hearts ache for the friend we lost and his beautiful family he left behind.

We know his larger than life personality will live on, through us, through his incredible wife and son, and through our communities.

We will make you proud James.

u/iamdeirdre: ReadJD was an amazing human being. He freely gave his help, time, encouragement, and enthusiasm to his friends, and his community!

JD and I lived on opposite sides of Florida, and every time a hurricane started to roll my way he would offer us a room. When I was overwhelmed by my subreddit, he was one of the awesome Florida mods that came aboard to help me wrangle it back into a decent place.

James was always a voice of reason, when people would send Modmails, he would really try to help people out, he always saw the best in people.

James was warm, and funny. He talked so lovingly about his wife, and especially about his son. One of our last conversations was about him setting up a special Minecraft server for his boy, he was really excited to get to play together.

When I made an attempt at raising money for St. Jude's Children's Hospital by streaming for Extra Life, James donated over $100, despite the fact that I'm a terrible streamer. I almost cried when I saw that.

James and I both were on the Mod Council, he really wanted to make things better for his fellow mods. He also tried to make life better in his home community by volunteering his time to a local politician he believed in.

u/realjd was a lovely human being, and I feel lucky that I got to be his friend for a few years, I wish it could have been longer.

u/RallyX26: I struggle to find the words to describe the loss of JD. As others before me have so eloquently stated, he was an incredible person to know and was such an inspiration to everyone around him. He inspired us all to be better people, not by force or by shame, but by example. He truly saw the good in everyone, he put the needs and betterment of everyone else above himself at all times, and he had a passion for volunteering that made the world a better place. He loved his family, he loved his community, and he loved his God. He was kind, he was loving, and he was selfless. He will be... He is... deeply missed.

Our thoughts go out to his family.

**Note:** This should go without saying but nevertheless it will be said -- this thread is going to be vigilantly monitored.

2798,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, warm, happy",Thinking about moving to Florida from Montana.,"Don't get me wrong, Montana is an absolutely gorgeous state with views that don't compare to many other places. However, I was born and raised in Florida, moved out of the state almost a decade ago now and every year I think about moving back but I am afraid of only being drawn back by nostalgia. I was raised in Pasco County, to give you an idea of where I'm from. I had no choice but to move, seeing as I was a minor at the time but now that I am financially stable and have nothing tying me down I've been toying with the idea to move back. I hate the winters, the snow is absolutely awful and just this last week it was -38 here in Montana. I have no love for snow sports, I love the heat and the humidity is something I'm used to. I would much rather do warm activities such as exploring, boating, hiking, and things of that nature. 

The main reason I want to move back to Florida is all my siblings live there with their kids, I am very family oriented and want to be involved in their lives. I know it's gotten far more expensive to live, but I am also moving from a place where a 1bd/1bath costs about 2,000$ a month. Car insurance here is cheap but car registration is not. Food prices are insane, but gas prices are low currently. Not to mention, the harsh conditions of the roads and the snow causes ware and tear on your vehicle. Within two months of living in Montana I had accumulated two cracks in my windshield and I stay far behind others while driving. All this to say, I am not very happy here.  Also Montana is very isolated with their cities, you have to drive at least two hours to get to another 'big' city. I like populated areas, being in the city. Yada yada. 

I've lived in Saint Louis, Detroit, and now a rinky-dink town in Montana so I am no stranger to extremely populated areas with high crime rates, low pay, and extremely populated areas. 

For those of you who were born in Florida, left and then came back, was it something you regretted or were you drawn back and enjoying it?  ",2024-01-18 19:44:01

I think everyone worries about their pets on New Years eve. The loud bangs are frightening to most animals including wild ones. We all know about keeping our pets indoors,  preparing a safe space for them and putting quiet music on for them. But there are a few other things that we can do to help them.

You can make them a homemade thundershirt from an old sheet or towel. Thundershirts create a warm calm feeling for dogs, just like a weighted blanket does for people. You can also try melatonin for their anxiety. 

If you are going out please be responsible, your pets will never understand why you didn't come home

We are spending New Years eve at home with our pets in our pj's , were giving a big shout out to everyone that is with us

2802,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, warm, happy",Cat 🙀 Cat! Stray cat,"So I'm in Orlando near a barns & noble when I hear this cat crying for help 😣 

I found the poor thing hiding in some bushhes dangerously close to the busy road... As I didn't want it do die of thirst or a car driving by i grabbed him and put him in my cat cage (he did bite me and scratch me but I wasn't about to let go and let him run into the street and also it didn't really hurt as he is so small) I didn't see the mother or any other cats or kittens around and the sun ☀ was frying me so I escaped to my cars air-conditioned environment where I could rest and pour alcohol on my hand (idk if it helps but better safe than sorry) so that it doesn't get infected. Still it's a risk I was willing to take. When I gave the cat water and food he ate like crazy 🤪 poor thing was starving and also drank water alot.. Now he is asleep in the cage, he also let me pet him and pick him up to see his sex and yes he is male, I'm happy 😊 to say that he isn't afraid of me anymore and it has only been like 3h since I caught him. 


Help me find his forever home please

I can't keep him I have 5 dogs. 
I just didn't want to see him get hurt on the streets. 
I'm afraid of shelters because I know they put cats to sleep if they aren't sold fast enough... So I don't want that. 

I'm posting this here in hope that someone here wants a cat and would like a black male kitten 😺 
To care for and love forever. 

If you or someone you know would love to give this cat a warm place to sleep and a great home with a loving family then message me there is no rehoming fees or anything like that. 

I'm giving it away for 🆓 as long as u promise you will provide it with a good life. ",2024-05-23 16:40:37

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60’s?) single pane windows. I’m still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7° temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, “ewww. 80s? You lizard. 🦎“ ... Lol, the room is around 78° and is a completely uninsulated 1970’s porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I’m thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

I do not care about power outages it is irrelevant. It's back on in a few days or a few hours. Most people fear power outages in Florida due to the extreme temperatures and the inability to find air conditioning in such an occasion. So you are aware the Florida born and raised can wear black sweater and a hoodie outside as I do this everyday. I wore the black hoodie to keep the sunlight off me. Even when I worked outside doing manual labor I kept a sweater on me. At lunch time when you take it off everything feels frigid like you just walked into a 73° house. This all comes from personal experience. If you're not seasoned for heat then you probably shouldn't be in Florida. It takes time for your body to be acclimated to the harsh climate here. What most people would consider suffering humidity we as Floridians don't really even notice it most of the time. Because when you're born in it, that just makes it business as usual. I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone. Democracy dies in the state. Heat makes people only care about what's actually important. So if you're from up North welcome to the Republic.

I can't be the only one that gets a little depressed in these summer months. With all of the beautiful sunshine, I should be enjoying time outside, right? But this is hard because of how hot it is. I want to go to the beach but the water there isn't even refreshing because it's so hot. It's also very crowded.

I love that I live in a place where I can get on my bike and ride somewhere. But I struggle to take advantage of this in the summer. There is so much planning I need to do in order to not die from the heat. And then I can only be out for so long in the sun before I feel sick.

A lot of times I end up staying inside all day, paralyzed by trying to make the decision to go out while also trying to plan for all that would entail. A lot of the things I would prefer to do indoors tend to be out of budget for me - things like going to the movies or out to eat or shopping at the mall. I end up feeling guilty because I should be grateful that I get to live in this great state but am not taking advantage of all it has to offer during these months.

So if anyone has tips they use. to get through this time of year I would love to hear what everyone else does!",2024-06-30 14:30:57

2830,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunshine, love",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.
 
I’m curious what you all have to say.",2024-06-12 14:37:32

2832,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunshine, love",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

My grandparents were born here, so I am not a native native ofc, but I’ve grown up here all my life, and I cannot imagine my life without the sunshine. I always dreamed of raising my kids here and taking them to all of the science centers, nature trails and beaches I love. Ik all the spots as a local.

My current plan is to go to PT school. I have scholarships to finish my BA at FAU honors for neuroscience and I’ll be graduating without debt which is a blessing. Once I graduate pt school, get some experience I’ll take the highest travel contracts and save. I would love to make a difference in FL healthcare. We need it so bad down here, but all healthcare workers are burning out. There are a lot of older people down here, so the rehab demand is good, but I hope I don’t get stuck working at a PT mill, where you can’t focus on individual patient care. 

Thoughts/advice?

There are currently 5 condo complexes being built within just a  3 mile square radius of me, and everything has become so expensive with demand to move here. In Martin county it’s no where near as developed as more southern coastal cities, however we are on route to leveling up with west palm and Boca. 
It’s going to be so packed and I feel our environment will suffer much more in the future. I’m not even against new housing being built! However, they should be making homes for people to buy capital, raise their families, and pass on generational wealth. We should not be living on top of one another.

You know, one of the best things about living in Florida is the warm climate. It’s pretty amazing to enjoy sunshine almost all year round, especially if you’re someone who prefers mild winters. And let’s not forget about the stunning beaches! There’s nothing like having beautiful stretches of sand right at your fingertips for relaxing or engaging in water sports.

Another major perk is that Florida doesn’t have a state income tax, which is a nice way to keep more of your hard-earned money. Plus, the cultural diversity here is fantastic. You can experience a vibrant mix of festivals, cuisines, and traditions from all over the world.

If you love the outdoors, you’re in for a treat! There are endless opportunities for hiking, fishing, boating, and golfing. And the natural beauty? Wow! Florida is home to unique ecosystems, including the breathtaking Everglades, and the wildlife is truly something to behold.

Let’s not forget about the world-class attractions, like Walt Disney World and Universal Studios, which provide endless entertainment for people of all ages. Lastly, if you’re thinking about retirement, Florida has a ton of active retirement communities that cater to those looking for a lively lifestyle in a warm setting. 

Sure, there’s a lot to bitch about.

We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating. I'd be giving up everything I love, even down to the food, weather, and geography.

2856,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunshine, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06

2862,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunshine, enjoy",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

You know, one of the best things about living in Florida is the warm climate. It’s pretty amazing to enjoy sunshine almost all year round, especially if you’re someone who prefers mild winters. And let’s not forget about the stunning beaches! There’s nothing like having beautiful stretches of sand right at your fingertips for relaxing or engaging in water sports.

Another major perk is that Florida doesn’t have a state income tax, which is a nice way to keep more of your hard-earned money. Plus, the cultural diversity here is fantastic. You can experience a vibrant mix of festivals, cuisines, and traditions from all over the world.

If you love the outdoors, you’re in for a treat! There are endless opportunities for hiking, fishing, boating, and golfing. And the natural beauty? Wow! Florida is home to unique ecosystems, including the breathtaking Everglades, and the wildlife is truly something to behold.

Let’s not forget about the world-class attractions, like Walt Disney World and Universal Studios, which provide endless entertainment for people of all ages. Lastly, if you’re thinking about retirement, Florida has a ton of active retirement communities that cater to those looking for a lively lifestyle in a warm setting. 

Sure, there’s a lot to bitch about. 

All in all, it’s a pretty appealing place to call home!",2024-10-06 12:29:11

2877,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunshine, comfortable",Heat film - effective heat reduction on old windows,"For those of us where replacing windows simply isn’t an option financially, or logistically, or because you’re a renter, just wanted to share a small success story on heat film.

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60’s?) single pane windows. I’m still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7° temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, “ewww. 80s? You lizard. 🦎“ ... Lol, the room is around 78° and is a completely uninsulated 1970’s porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I’m thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

I do not care about power outages it is irrelevant. It's back on in a few days or a few hours. Most people fear power outages in Florida due to the extreme temperatures and the inability to find air conditioning in such an occasion. So you are aware the Florida born and raised can wear black sweater and a hoodie outside as I do this everyday. I wore the black hoodie to keep the sunlight off me. Even when I worked outside doing manual labor I kept a sweater on me. At lunch time when you take it off everything feels frigid like you just walked into a 73° house. This all comes from personal experience. If you're not seasoned for heat then you probably shouldn't be in Florida. It takes time for your body to be acclimated to the harsh climate here. What most people would consider suffering humidity we as Floridians don't really even notice it most of the time. Because when you're born in it, that just makes it business as usual. I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone. Democracy dies in the state. Heat makes people only care about what's actually important. So if you're from up North welcome to the Republic.

- indoors (or during cooler weather if outdoors)
- ceremony and reception in the same area
- dancefloor/DJ/MC
- buffet food
- 5pm - 11 pm(?)
- wedding planner
- photographer
- videographer

We’d love something nice for sure and if need be we can try to trim the guest list. We don’t need a grand Waikiki hotel wedding (though if there is one that fits our budget that would be great). Preferred location would be in town somewhere since we’d have several out-of-state visitors who would probably be staying in Waikiki. But open to other suggestions as well.

Preferences:
- indoors (or during cooler weather if outdoors)
- ceremony and reception in the same area
- dancefloor/DJ/MC
- buffet food
- 5pm - 11 pm(?)
- wedding planner
- photographer
- videographer

Generally speaking, is this budget pretty far-fetched or is it doable?

2925,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, love",Hot Take: Supreme Court Striking Down Affirmative Action in College Admissions Benefits Local Filipinos Applying to Colleges on the Mainland,"A very controversial topic here - I'm mostly satisfied with the Supreme Court's decision to strike down affirmative action in college admissions. Why? I believe this will help Filipino Americans from Hawai'i the most.

The issue with affirmative action in American Academia is it ignores the socioeconomic status of overrepresented minorities (aka Asian Americans lol). If you aren't aware, Asian American college applicants tend to be labeled as ORM in the college admissions process (Overrepresented Minorities). Admissions committees at prestigious universities and colleges on the mainland view Asian applicants all the same for the most part.

So what ends up happening is you have a local Filipino kid from a place like Waipahu, Kalihi, Waiʻanae, Wahiawa, etc. that went to a lower-tiered public school with a lower GPA and no extracurricular activity since he probably had to work during school to financially support himself or his family competing against the stereotypical privileged Asian American mainland applicants with kickass resumes, 4.0 GPAs, outstanding extracurriculars, community leadership, etc. That local Filipino kid will have a very difficult time navigating through the college admissions process.

Let's look at this scenario. I will provide two different college applicant profiles.

Applicant #1: Filipino kid from Hawai'i. 3.4 GPA. Graduated from Leilehua HS. Worked at Jack in the Box throughout High School to help financially support his single mother who works as a full-time Janitor. He applies to USC.

Applicant #2: White Latino kid from the Bay Area. 3.6 GPA. Graduated from a decent public school. Played Football and was a part of his school's newspaper. His mom is a nurse and his father is an investment banker. He also applies to USC.

Applicant #2 has more of a likelihood of being accepted to USC (in my opinion) because he is labeled as a ""Latino"" (which is an underrepresented group in academia) even though he grew up with a much more privileged life than the local Filipino kid. The local Filipino kid is then lumped into the same bucket as the rich Japanese kid who graduated from Punahou. So what happens? The local Filipino kid will get his application dumped.

One reason why I love Hawai'i so much is we actually get race right here for the most part. Sure, we have our issues with economic inequality and underrepresentation in leadership for specific ethnic groups like Filipinos, Native Hawaiians, Samoans, Tongans, Micronesians, Vietnamese, etc. BUT at least we culturally understand how different these groups are collectively. Here in Hawai'i, you can find actual stats differentiated by ethnic groups by our local government unlike in the mainland where they just lump everyone into the same Asian American and Pacific Islander statistic. We are not a monolith. These different ethnic groups have their own cultural issues and pain points that deserve their own attention. This is what the Supreme Court ruling from earlier today does - and I hope in the future we can see admissions committees putting more of an emphasis on socioeconomic status rather than race.

I'm excited about what is next for my local Filipino brothers and sisters. We all have a work ethic that can't be matched. I recently went to a Waipahu High School graduation and saw the number of Filipino valedictorians who also graduated with their AAs before earning their high school diplomas. I was very encouraged. I'm glad these kids will now have a fair shot moving forward. This is a big win for us. These are my thoughts and thank you for allowing me to share them. Mahalo.

EDIT: Knew I would get downvoted posting this. Would love to hear your guys' thoughts and would like to hear you refute the unfairness poor Asian Americans have faced being negatively impacted in college admissions throughout the years.",2023-06-29 20:03:26

2928,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, love",Efficiently using a heat pump in a high rise,"Had a bit of a life change recently and I'm befuddled by modern amenities. I've always lived in older crappy ground-floor apartments with window A/C \*at best\* and my usual methods for saving on a power bill seem wrong. I usually run the A/C when it's hot and turn it off / open the windows when it's cooler. I'll jack the temperature higher during the day if we're not home so the system doesn't work as hard to keep things cool.

For heat pumps, the guidance seems to be ""[set it and forget it](https://www.efficiencymaine.com/heat-pump-user-tip-set-it-and-forget-it/)"" but it still feels pretty weird to open the windows with the unit on. We've been maintaining a temperature of 75f with the fan on auto. We open the windows when we wake up (usually 5am) and close them when the outside temp reaches 75 (usually 10am). The unit stays on blowing a very small amount of colder air into the room even when the temperature is lower than 75. This is way different than the window or portable units that have the compressor kicking on and off as it reaches the temperature threshold.

Another thing that may be specific to a high rise: we love the night time temperature in Hawaii and usually slept with windows open and fans going. Doesn't seem to work in a taller building for whatever reason. Last weekend, the outside temp dropped below 75 pretty quickly after the sun went down but despite all the windows open and fans going, the interior of our apartment never got below 80 and was pretty hot/humid when we woke up in the morning. My theory is that the exterior of the building was still warmed from the sun and we caught the rising heat in our windows instead of fresh air.

The remotes and distributors are Carrier branded, the heat pump itself on my lanai is unbranded.

I'm not trying to desperately min/max my power bill but just trying to be efficient while getting as much fresh air outside as possible. Any advice from folks who have a similar setup would be greatly appreciated :)",2023-01-27 17:12:39

I'm reading various biographies of the ali'i and discovering just how *problematic* some of them are, while also being incredibly pivotal some of them were? 

* Like... our boy Prince Jonah Kūnio got his ass arrested at age 24 and, almost executed, but instead put in prison for a year for participating in the Wilcox Rebellion (the counter rebellion), basically, the three-day re-coup d'etat to put his Auntie Liliuokalani back in the throne... Post prison, did a self-exile with his wife and travelled the West, joined the British Army, then came back as the only congressman by age 31? Hot. 
* Princess Ka'iulani was a spoiled rich girl really detached from the soon-to-be overthrown Hawaiian Monarchy frivolously spending her money studying abroad in Europe... but then in a last-ditch recovery act attempts to become heir-apparent and make aristocratic salòn discourse to keep Hawaiian sovereignty? Then I recognize that she was primarily raised by haoles and lost her Hawaiian mother early on, so can only do so much.  
* Forgot that Ka'ahumanu is simultaneously **swamp** **ass** and **bad-ass**? For hardcore assimilating and indoctrinating Christianity into the people and banning hula. *BANNING HULA.* Then again, she effectively toppled the *kapu* system by eating with her sister-wife at her son, Kamehameha II's, mens' only table... not fearing death nor her son killing her? girl was wild. 

**Reason why I ask**... cause rendering these biographies and distilling them into chismis, or essentially tea-spilling, or trash talking, or whatever is helping me remember their accomplishments and failures. More specifically... my kumu hula asked me to reflect on which royal or neighboring island ali'i and to think of them in contemporary ways, where they align on the political spectrum, to what culture and religion/spirituality they valued, their contributions... and the only effective way I've learned is to talk about these stories as if they were some everyday folks?

it looks like the law is that you can have four inches of tint from your roof down? I don't understand why it's not allowed for us to have like 5 percent ceramic tint to protect us from the heat and the uv for the entire windshield. The 5 percent ceramic tint reflects a lot more than 5 percent uv and infrared light. The 5 percent is just visible light. I noticed my car gets 20 precent better mpgs when I turn the ac down and point it at my face. So not having a full windshield tint is in no doubt costing more fuel in air conditioning. 

There's absolutely nothing wrong with a 5 percent tint and it barely makes a visible light difference at all. There are tinting materials out there that don't block any visible light, can we put that on the windshield?

My thoughts on it at this point is that there’s already been some progress made on the project so it might as well be fully finished. I believe stopping The Rail project at The Aloha Stadium and only having it go from Kapolei to ‘Aiea is stupid. I say build the dang thing to Downtown Honolulu and eventually UH Mānoa since that’s where I think the massive investment we poured into this project will only pay off. 

Here’s a little bit of background of myself. I was raised in Central O’ahu and went to public school there. Mid way thru my elementary school days my family moved to the west side. My parents still let me attend elementary, intermediate, and high school in Central O’ahu even though we lived on the west side BUT said I was on my own in getting to and from school. So, I took The Bus and walked everywhere since the age of 9 - to school and summer fun early in the morning and after school late at night after sports practices and club activities. Many of the other parents and my friends’ families thought my mom and dad didn’t love me and were abusive because of this… (what a bunch of privileged clowns). Anyways, this sort of “you’re on your own” thing kinda seeped into everywhere else sort of so as a kid I was very very independent. Every time I went out I had to take The Bus. I never got rides from my parents. I didn’t get to save up and buy a car until I was 21 years old. So, even in my early college years when I was interning in Downtown Honolulu in the late hours at night, I took The Bus to get back home to the west side and sometimes found myself not getting home until 11PM. 

So, because of my background I’m confident in saying I’m pretty well versed in public transportation. After taking The Bus daily for 12 years, I observed and noticed the type of people who used our public transportation system here in Hawai’i - and let me tell you they’re being scapegoated the most out of this whole Rail debate. In my experience, the ones primarily riding The Bus are your older Filipino, Hawaiian, Samoan, and Micronesian uncles and aunties getting off of work in Downtown Honolulu that are heading back home to Waipahu, ‘Ewa Beach, Kapolei, Wai’anae. Y’all really do not know how long it takes to take The Bus from Downtown Honolulu to the west side. It takes forever!!! With all time you take waiting for The Bus, The Bus stopping at literally every single stop, transferring to different busses if needed, walking to locations that don’t have bus stops, etc. it can literally take an hour and a half to two hours to get home. This is in comparison to having a car where it’ll take you maybe half an hour to get home. With The Rail, these other uncles and aunties can get home much much faster. What are the indirect results of this? You’d be surprised: Improved family dynamics. Children’s mental health and success in school is directly linked to the amount of time parents are around the house. If these parents or grandparents can get home quicker, we’ll see improvements in our family and adolescent mental health. This can all trickle down into other statistics like less crimes committed by adolescents, decrease in childhood obesity, increased rates of likelihood of volunteering for non-profits, decrease in high school drop out rates, higher college matriculation rates, etc. 

I wanted to write this post because I noticed there are primarily two types of people who are anti-rail. The first being people who do not trust The City & County of Honolulu and the State of Hawai’i to manage the project. Hey, I don’t blame these people and will not fight them. There are talking points that these individuals make that are valid. We’ve all seen examples of how our local government has botched projects like The Rail, The Aloha Stadium, etc. that lead us to believe they cannot be trusted with our tax dollars. Sure, I get that. My gripes are not with those people though but are with the second type of people I noticed who are anti-rail, the unempathetic folks who were pampered their entire lives and don’t understand the negatives that come with relying so heavily on our current public transportation infrastructure system. When I was a student at UHM we had a rail debate in one of my classes. The professor allowed students to choose sides. I noticed everyone on the anti-rail side were either private school kids, kids who were picked up and dropped off every where by their parents their entire lives, were gifted vehicles when they were in high school, etc. Not a shocker to me btw - the people who have never experienced hardship related to transportation not understanding and lacking empathy for those who do. These people are just so blind and ignorant to what the working class people have to go through. I remember sitting on The Bus daily and just seeing all of these aunties and uncles looking like zombies fighting to stay awake after a long day of work… fortunately for me I was a young energetic man who could survive off barley having any sleep. These type of anti-rail people really don’t know the struggle lol

So, all I’m saying is whether you’re pro-rail or anti-rail, sit back and think who is this really for? Is this rail project being built for me? or is it for someone else? Hey man, I’m a bit of a fiscally conservative person myself who hates high taxes and high cost of living but these old aunties and uncles are all paying taxes too.

- indoors (or during cooler weather if outdoors)
- ceremony and reception in the same area

I visited Oahu back in January with my family. I honestly wasn’t 100% keen on going but I supposed it would be an experience. As soon as we got out if the airport I fell in love. I loved the sense of community anywhere you go and how happy everyone seemed to be. 

I was/am born and raised in Idaho. I live in a smaller city with a population under 100k. I’ve never really felt 100% in place here. Dont get me wrong the mountains are lovely but only in Spring and Summer. Im not a Fall and Winter kind of guy. But Ive always loved the idea of living somewhere warm year round and even tropical since I’m a waterbaby. 

Back to living in Hawaii though. Im only 19 and have a decent savings and would love to try and move over onto one of the islands. I’m just curious if the Big Island feels somewhat like Oahu since id like to try and live on the Big Island. I’m also curious if there’s a stigma about outsiders. Since im only 19 I haven’t set any roots down and would love to try Hawaii. Even if I fail I can still say I lived there. My girlfriend would also be moving with me as she LOVES tropical plants and loves the idea of island life. So that also would bring a second income into the mix.

This is a follow up from my post last summer ([https://www.reddit.com/r/BigIsland/comments/x2z0q4/need\_some\_big\_island\_help\_on\_100\_year\_old\_family/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigIsland/comments/x2z0q4/need_some_big_island_help_on_100_year_old_family/))

My hope in originally posting to [r/BigIsland](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigIsland/) was to maybe find some answers about my grandfathers off the books adoption. After listening to my story, the advice that many of you gave was to come out, meet folks, and hopefully find some of the binders that many families keep that might have some answers. So, I've decided to go all in and do just that.

The stars happened to align in terms of time off and cheap flights and I am flying to the Big Island today to spend a few days in Waimea to see what I might be able to discover.

Based on the feedback from people on my last post, I am visiting the Paniolo Preservation Society Museum. I'm having dinner with a long time employee and historian from the Parker Ranch, and plan to stop by the Waimea Vital Statistics office to see if they might be able to help.

If anyone is familiar with Waimea or the ranching community, I'd love to know some places I could visit  where locals might normally hangout. **I'm hoping to strike up some conversations with the elders of the area who might be familiar with at least some of the history I am searching for. Any recommendations on places to visit would be awesome. I know I'm just some random guy coming from the mainland, but from the messages I have received, Hawaii seems to be deeply rooted in family. For me, this trip is about trying to find my family and I hope people will respond positively to that and be open to help!**

Again, my hope is to find some additional pictures of Alex James Napier, try to learn who my great grandmother might have been (my grandfather was most likely born out of wedlock), and maybe, just maybe, learn the story of his secret adoption.

Here's a website I built that sums up everything about the story and what i am looking for ([http://www.georgefamilysearch.com/](http://www.georgefamilysearch.com/))

Also, thank you to everyone who has encouraged me or taken time to help. I can't say how grateful I am for all of you time!",2023-03-04 20:51:06

However, I've heard at least a few people in my time here so far telling what their ""Hawaiian name"" is.

Over the weekend, I was sitting in front of a white lady who was talking to a tourist and she was telling her all about the island, including that she's been living here for 18 years and then told her her name followed by ""but my Hawaiian name is"" and then said some Hawaiian name I'm sure she thought was pretty.

I visited Oahu back in January with my family. I honestly wasn’t 100% keen on going but I supposed it would be an experience. As soon as we got out if the airport I fell in love. I loved the sense of community anywhere you go and how happy everyone seemed to be. 

I was/am born and raised in Idaho. I live in a smaller city with a population under 100k. I’ve never really felt 100% in place here. Dont get me wrong the mountains are lovely but only in Spring and Summer. Im not a Fall and Winter kind of guy. But Ive always loved the idea of living somewhere warm year round and even tropical since I’m a waterbaby. 

Back to living in Hawaii though. Im only 19 and have a decent savings and would love to try and move over onto one of the islands. I’m just curious if the Big Island feels somewhat like Oahu since id like to try and live on the Big Island. I’m also curious if there’s a stigma about outsiders. Since im only 19 I haven’t set any roots down and would love to try Hawaii. Even if I fail I can still say I lived there. My girlfriend would also be moving with me as she LOVES tropical plants and loves the idea of island life. So that also would bring a second income into the mix.

- indoors (or during cooler weather if outdoors)
- ceremony and reception in the same area
- dancefloor/DJ/MC
- buffet food
- 5pm - 11 pm(?)
- wedding planner
- photographer
- videographer

I'm from Colorado, which qualifies me for the Western Undergraduate Exchange program. Does anyone have anything to share about their experiences at these colleges to help me pick which one I should attend for this major? I'm most concerned about the marine bio programs the colleges have over anything else, but I can't decide which one will be most beneficial to me. Thanks for the help y'all!

UPDATE (Jan 13, 2024): A lot of you guys are also mentioning to attend UH Hilo that doesn't offer marine biology, but rather offers a ""marine science"" major. What is the difference between marine science and marine biology? Every description I look at for marine science is exceedingly vague and I can't tell which major would best fit what I'm interested in. What I plan to do with my degree is to get into genetic engineering: I wanna genetically modify coral reefs to withstand ocean acidification and gain heat resistance to mitigate the effects of climate change and global warming to prevent bleaching events. Based on this short description of what I want to do, what are your thoughts of where I should attend?

P.S. please do not bash my major / future career plans for the amount of money they will make. I'm financially able to handle myself just fine wherever I go. Besides, I rather be happy doing what I love for the rest of my life helping the planet prosper, rather than regretting not chasing my dreams stuck with a different major I could get almost anywhere.

People in Louisiana have recently used one technique, called ""Structured Decision Making,"" that was developed United States Geological Survey to get people to talk with other and work together and make decisions and formulate and implement policy while integrating values and science into the processn. Although this was developed to help communities deal with formulating environmental policy and surface and ground water management, it should applicable and helpful to many other concerns where multiple communities and groups have differing ideas about what the problems / concerns are and how they should be solved.

This has been most recently used to get desperate communities, e.g. industries, municipalities, environmental organizations, communities, sportsmen, farmers, and so forth together in part of southeastern Louisiana to create acceptable water management policy for the Southern Hills Aqufier region in Louisiana. If it works in Louisiana, it should work elsewhere.

3022,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, love",Efficiently using a heat pump in a high rise,"Had a bit of a life change recently and I'm befuddled by modern amenities. I've always lived in older crappy ground-floor apartments with window A/C \*at best\* and my usual methods for saving on a power bill seem wrong. I usually run the A/C when it's hot and turn it off / open the windows when it's cooler. I'll jack the temperature higher during the day if we're not home so the system doesn't work as hard to keep things cool.

For heat pumps, the guidance seems to be ""[set it and forget it](https://www.efficiencymaine.com/heat-pump-user-tip-set-it-and-forget-it/)"" but it still feels pretty weird to open the windows with the unit on. We've been maintaining a temperature of 75f with the fan on auto. We open the windows when we wake up (usually 5am) and close them when the outside temp reaches 75 (usually 10am). The unit stays on blowing a very small amount of colder air into the room even when the temperature is lower than 75. This is way different than the window or portable units that have the compressor kicking on and off as it reaches the temperature threshold.

Another thing that may be specific to a high rise: we love the night time temperature in Hawaii and usually slept with windows open and fans going. Doesn't seem to work in a taller building for whatever reason. Last weekend, the outside temp dropped below 75 pretty quickly after the sun went down but despite all the windows open and fans going, the interior of our apartment never got below 80 and was pretty hot/humid when we woke up in the morning. My theory is that the exterior of the building was still warmed from the sun and we caught the rising heat in our windows instead of fresh air.

The remotes and distributors are Carrier branded, the heat pump itself on my lanai is unbranded.

I'm not trying to desperately min/max my power bill but just trying to be efficient while getting as much fresh air outside as possible. Any advice from folks who have a similar setup would be greatly appreciated :)",2023-01-27 17:12:39

People in Louisiana have recently used one technique, called ""Structured Decision Making,"" that was developed United States Geological Survey to get people to talk with other and work together and make decisions and formulate and implement policy while integrating values and science into the processn. Although this was developed to help communities deal with formulating environmental policy and surface and ground water management, it should applicable and helpful to many other concerns where multiple communities and groups have differing ideas about what the problems / concerns are and how they should be solved.

This has been most recently used to get desperate communities, e.g. industries, municipalities, environmental organizations, communities, sportsmen, farmers, and so forth together in part of southeastern Louisiana to create acceptable water management policy for the Southern Hills Aqufier region in Louisiana. If it works in Louisiana, it should work elsewhere.

The resulting management plan is:

Over the weekend, I was sitting in front of a white lady who was talking to a tourist and she was telling her all about the island, including that she's been living here for 18 years and then told her her name followed by ""but my Hawaiian name is"" and then said some Hawaiian name I'm sure she thought was pretty.

I'm from Colorado, which qualifies me for the Western Undergraduate Exchange program. Does anyone have anything to share about their experiences at these colleges to help me pick which one I should attend for this major? I'm most concerned about the marine bio programs the colleges have over anything else, but I can't decide which one will be most beneficial to me. Thanks for the help y'all!

UPDATE (Jan 13, 2024): A lot of you guys are also mentioning to attend UH Hilo that doesn't offer marine biology, but rather offers a ""marine science"" major. What is the difference between marine science and marine biology? Every description I look at for marine science is exceedingly vague and I can't tell which major would best fit what I'm interested in. What I plan to do with my degree is to get into genetic engineering: I wanna genetically modify coral reefs to withstand ocean acidification and gain heat resistance to mitigate the effects of climate change and global warming to prevent bleaching events. Based on this short description of what I want to do, what are your thoughts of where I should attend?

P.S. please do not bash my major / future career plans for the amount of money they will make. I'm financially able to handle myself just fine wherever I go. Besides, I rather be happy doing what I love for the rest of my life helping the planet prosper, rather than regretting not chasing my dreams stuck with a different major I could get almost anywhere. Most of the schools I have applied to are more expensive to attend than Hawaii anyways (California and Florida).",2024-01-11 04:22:17

it looks like the law is that you can have four inches of tint from your roof down? I don't understand why it's not allowed for us to have like 5 percent ceramic tint to protect us from the heat and the uv for the entire windshield. The 5 percent ceramic tint reflects a lot more than 5 percent uv and infrared light. The 5 percent is just visible light. I noticed my car gets 20 precent better mpgs when I turn the ac down and point it at my face. So not having a full windshield tint is in no doubt costing more fuel in air conditioning. 

There's absolutely nothing wrong with a 5 percent tint and it barely makes a visible light difference at all. There are tinting materials out there that don't block any visible light, can we put that on the windshield?

I'm from Colorado, which qualifies me for the Western Undergraduate Exchange program. Does anyone have anything to share about their experiences at these colleges to help me pick which one I should attend for this major? I'm most concerned about the marine bio programs the colleges have over anything else, but I can't decide which one will be most beneficial to me. Thanks for the help y'all!

UPDATE (Jan 13, 2024): A lot of you guys are also mentioning to attend UH Hilo that doesn't offer marine biology, but rather offers a ""marine science"" major. What is the difference between marine science and marine biology? Every description I look at for marine science is exceedingly vague and I can't tell which major would best fit what I'm interested in. What I plan to do with my degree is to get into genetic engineering: I wanna genetically modify coral reefs to withstand ocean acidification and gain heat resistance to mitigate the effects of climate change and global warming to prevent bleaching events. Based on this short description of what I want to do, what are your thoughts of where I should attend?

P.S. please do not bash my major / future career plans for the amount of money they will make. I'm financially able to handle myself just fine wherever I go. Besides, I rather be happy doing what I love for the rest of my life helping the planet prosper, rather than regretting not chasing my dreams stuck with a different major I could get almost anywhere.

I visited Oahu back in January with my family. I honestly wasn’t 100% keen on going but I supposed it would be an experience. As soon as we got out if the airport I fell in love. I loved the sense of community anywhere you go and how happy everyone seemed to be. 

I was/am born and raised in Idaho. I live in a smaller city with a population under 100k. I’ve never really felt 100% in place here. Dont get me wrong the mountains are lovely but only in Spring and Summer. Im not a Fall and Winter kind of guy. But Ive always loved the idea of living somewhere warm year round and even tropical since I’m a waterbaby. 

Back to living in Hawaii though. Im only 19 and have a decent savings and would love to try and move over onto one of the islands. I’m just curious if the Big Island feels somewhat like Oahu since id like to try and live on the Big Island. I’m also curious if there’s a stigma about outsiders. Since im only 19 I haven’t set any roots down and would love to try Hawaii. Even if I fail I can still say I lived there. My girlfriend would also be moving with me as she LOVES tropical plants and loves the idea of island life. So that also would bring a second income into the mix.

3095,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, love",Biki Sucks,"When Biki first came out, I thought it was a great, innovative idea but nothing has changed since (not surprised). They were truly ahead of the curve in this aspect. However, time has passed and they're not electric, they're hard to come across, they're worn down, rusty, and just plain slow.

They're relatively expensive as well. New York City has the Citi Bike and although it costs more for an unlimiated day pass ($19 vs $15), it costs just $200 per year (unlimited) and has the same $4.50 single use cost. For that, you get well-maintained, abundant electric bicycles that are fast and can power up hills. Biki's $4.50 single use fee is horrible considering The Bus is just $3 and short Uber rides can be had for $7.

Hawaii has hills and bursts of wind that will bring you to a halt, requiring extra pedaling effort at times and in warm weather it means showing up to work in a sweat, which sucks.

An electric Biki would allow for expanded use, such as the Kahala and Hawaii Kai area, which has great bike paths. To be honest, an electric scooter system would be much easier and cost effective to manage vs a bike. Some cities had problems with them being dumped in random places, but some are getting better as they require riders to photograph the scooter after parking to avoid fees.

Driving sucks in Hawaii and there's no viable alternatives, so we need innovative solutions that are far better than what Biki has to offer. I hope the service will expand to electric or consider push scooters. Or I hope the city will allow for some competition from Lyft/Uber or anyone else.

Due to weather in the area, cold temp and downpour rain, decided to bring kitten inside and have been keeping it warm and feeding.  Unfortunately, I’m not able to keep it due to having a multi-dog household.

I have already reached out to many local cat groups, orgs, and rescue through email and social media, but wanted to reach out here. She’s a fighter and deserves a chance. Please PM me if you know of a rescue that is able to take her in, a few already let me know they aren’t able to, or can but only when she’s older.

3101,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, love",Efficiently using a heat pump in a high rise,"Had a bit of a life change recently and I'm befuddled by modern amenities. I've always lived in older crappy ground-floor apartments with window A/C \*at best\* and my usual methods for saving on a power bill seem wrong. I usually run the A/C when it's hot and turn it off / open the windows when it's cooler. I'll jack the temperature higher during the day if we're not home so the system doesn't work as hard to keep things cool.

For heat pumps, the guidance seems to be ""[set it and forget it](https://www.efficiencymaine.com/heat-pump-user-tip-set-it-and-forget-it/)"" but it still feels pretty weird to open the windows with the unit on. We've been maintaining a temperature of 75f with the fan on auto. We open the windows when we wake up (usually 5am) and close them when the outside temp reaches 75 (usually 10am). The unit stays on blowing a very small amount of colder air into the room even when the temperature is lower than 75. This is way different than the window or portable units that have the compressor kicking on and off as it reaches the temperature threshold.

Another thing that may be specific to a high rise: we love the night time temperature in Hawaii and usually slept with windows open and fans going. Doesn't seem to work in a taller building for whatever reason. Last weekend, the outside temp dropped below 75 pretty quickly after the sun went down but despite all the windows open and fans going, the interior of our apartment never got below 80 and was pretty hot/humid when we woke up in the morning. My theory is that the exterior of the building was still warmed from the sun and we caught the rising heat in our windows instead of fresh air.

The remotes and distributors are Carrier branded, the heat pump itself on my lanai is unbranded.

I'm not trying to desperately min/max my power bill but just trying to be efficient while getting as much fresh air outside as possible. Any advice from folks who have a similar setup would be greatly appreciated :)",2023-01-27 17:12:39
3102,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, hate","Locals that moved to the mainland, how did you cope?","Born & raised Hawai'i, moved about 2 years ago to work, and its been great for my finances, not so great for my mental.

It's the small things I miss, and it's the small things that pain me. I'm making this post because I want to ask those of you who were maybe born & raised HI, but moved to the mainland at some point, how did you cope?

I'm tired of the microcorrections to pidgin slip-ups (brah I miss shooting the shit in pidgin), constantly being asked for ""permission"" to visit the islands (LMFAOO), actionless Maui sympathizers that really just want to tell me all about their last trip to the islands, and guys, weeaboos up here are something else. In Hawai'i I felt it was easier for me to join in on the jokes around weeb culture, but here, sometimes it gets creepy. Speaking of jokes- there is some sense of humor between the locals I've met here that I just don't understand. Some people I've met would poke fun at others by putting them down, or making backhanded remarks which, maybe to them seems like an obvious joke, but to me falls flat on the curve of humor. Theres more to my frustrations, but I'm really just seeking advice, so I don't want this to be a bigger rant.

At first I thought I just hated these fakas, but I think I just don't understand them. I don't get the humor, my lived experiences with Hawai'i are different & longer than their week long vacays, and the culture here is just different. And really my biggest problem is, I don't want to understand them.

For locals that moved to the mainland at some point, what were some things that helped you adjust/be more open-minded? Bonus question: did you move back to the islands?

EDIT:
Thank you to all the kind and open comments sharing your advice/stories. I got pulled aside to do something for work so I haven't been able to respond to everyone, but I have been reading the thread and will continue to read through it & respond where can.

It's been really nice to reminisce with & learn from the mo'olelo shared here (from multiple perspectives even!). I've been feeling pretty negative about being up here, which I've been trying to confront & work through. It is really comforting to see that I am not alone here AND that it is very possible to find excitement & joy in the differences. I know it is just a little Reddit thread, but reading through, I've felt both warmed & more invigorated to do some more adventuring while I'm away from the islands.

3103,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, hate",Musubi,"I wanted to say thank you for Hawaii. When I was young, my dad was in the army and was station in Honolulu, so I was very fortunate to live for four years in Hawaii. My favorite snack from Hawaii was Musubi. My mom hated making it because no one else in the family likes it besides me, so I only got to eat it on rare occasions when my friends moms made it. Well fast forward a life time, long after i forgot about my favorite childhood snack, I was walking through the grocery store and I looked near the bottom of the shelf and I saw a can of spam. All of a sudden I was reminded of over twenty years ago with the breeze coming up off of the ocean, the warm sun in the sky, and the sand on my feet. I decided to buy the spam and some nori, and I never thought such a simple snack could bring me so much joy. I am a 6’3” tall white man, covered in tattoos, I’ve worked construction, I drove a semi truck for years, and I wear flannels and blue jeans nearly year round now. But for a moment, I was five years old again, and I was dancing in the kitchen with my musubi. I know this post is silly, but I’ve never had any food have such a profound effect on me. So thank you to Hawaii. Thank you to the people. Thank you for treating a chubby little white boy like family and making him feel at home.",2023-03-12 18:28:36

3107,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, hate",Random Question for Locals Gen X or Older - Frozen Veg,"ETA CLAIRIFICATION: I'm grateful for everyone sharing what they buy (frozen, fresh, or canned) nowadays.  I'm specifically wondering and asking about whem the transition from canned to fresh happened for those who grew up on Hawaii. Because for many people I know of similar age, our families bought fresh or canned for our earliest years, then at some point (intermediate or high school - so sometime in the 80s?), we transitioned from canned and fresh to frozen and fresh.  But maybe that wasore a socio economic thing (working class or immigrant families) and maybe more affluent families at the time got frozen veg earlier. Or maybe frozen veg just wasn't so much a thing in Hawaii supearlets until the 80s? 

When do you remember starting to buy (or your parents buying) frozen veggies versus canned? My husband and I were talking about how inferior canned veggies (particularly corn, peas, and green beans) are to frozen, and how much we hated canned veggies when we were school aged. But we can't remember when our parents started buying frozen. We just know we liked frozen so much better. Even now, we have corn, peas, green beans, gobo, kale, kabocha, and lotus root (also poi!) in our freezer. 

I still do have warm nostalgic feelings for canned asparagus w/shoyu shichimi mayo...a sentiment my beloved does not share.

So yeah: do you recall when frozen veg became part of your groceries? And if you want to share a frozen veg recipe, please do! I'll share a couple of mine in comments. Mahalos!

I'm from Colorado, which qualifies me for the Western Undergraduate Exchange program. Does anyone have anything to share about their experiences at these colleges to help me pick which one I should attend for this major? I'm most concerned about the marine bio programs the colleges have over anything else, but I can't decide which one will be most beneficial to me. Thanks for the help y'all!

UPDATE (Jan 13, 2024): A lot of you guys are also mentioning to attend UH Hilo that doesn't offer marine biology, but rather offers a ""marine science"" major. What is the difference between marine science and marine biology? Every description I look at for marine science is exceedingly vague and I can't tell which major would best fit what I'm interested in. What I plan to do with my degree is to get into genetic engineering: I wanna genetically modify coral reefs to withstand ocean acidification and gain heat resistance to mitigate the effects of climate change and global warming to prevent bleaching events. Based on this short description of what I want to do, what are your thoughts of where I should attend?

P.S. please do not bash my major / future career plans for the amount of money they will make. I'm financially able to handle myself just fine wherever I go. Besides, I rather be happy doing what I love for the rest of my life helping the planet prosper, rather than regretting not chasing my dreams stuck with a different major I could get almost anywhere.

I visited Oahu back in January with my family. I honestly wasn’t 100% keen on going but I supposed it would be an experience. As soon as we got out if the airport I fell in love. I loved the sense of community anywhere you go and how happy everyone seemed to be. 

I was/am born and raised in Idaho. I live in a smaller city with a population under 100k. I’ve never really felt 100% in place here. Dont get me wrong the mountains are lovely but only in Spring and Summer. Im not a Fall and Winter kind of guy. But Ive always loved the idea of living somewhere warm year round and even tropical since I’m a waterbaby. 

Back to living in Hawaii though. Im only 19 and have a decent savings and would love to try and move over onto one of the islands. I’m just curious if the Big Island feels somewhat like Oahu since id like to try and live on the Big Island. I’m also curious if there’s a stigma about outsiders. Since im only 19 I haven’t set any roots down and would love to try Hawaii. Even if I fail I can still say I lived there. My girlfriend would also be moving with me as she LOVES tropical plants and loves the idea of island life. So that also would bring a second income into the mix.

Driving sucks in Hawaii and there's no viable alternatives, so we need innovative solutions that are far better than what Biki has to offer. I hope the service will expand to electric or consider push scooters. Or I hope the city will allow for some competition from Lyft/Uber or anyone else.

It's the small things I miss, and it's the small things that pain me. I'm making this post because I want to ask those of you who were maybe born & raised HI, but moved to the mainland at some point, how did you cope?

I'm tired of the microcorrections to pidgin slip-ups (brah I miss shooting the shit in pidgin), constantly being asked for ""permission"" to visit the islands (LMFAOO), actionless Maui sympathizers that really just want to tell me all about their last trip to the islands, and guys, weeaboos up here are something else. In Hawai'i I felt it was easier for me to join in on the jokes around weeb culture, but here, sometimes it gets creepy. Speaking of jokes- there is some sense of humor between the locals I've met here that I just don't understand. Some people I've met would poke fun at others by putting them down, or making backhanded remarks which, maybe to them seems like an obvious joke, but to me falls flat on the curve of humor. Theres more to my frustrations, but I'm really just seeking advice, so I don't want this to be a bigger rant.

At first I thought I just hated these fakas, but I think I just don't understand them. I don't get the humor, my lived experiences with Hawai'i are different & longer than their week long vacays, and the culture here is just different. And really my biggest problem is, I don't want to understand them.

For locals that moved to the mainland at some point, what were some things that helped you adjust/be more open-minded? Bonus question: did you move back to the islands?

EDIT:
Thank you to all the kind and open comments sharing your advice/stories. I got pulled aside to do something for work so I haven't been able to respond to everyone, but I have been reading the thread and will continue to read through it & respond where can.

It's been really nice to reminisce with & learn from the mo'olelo shared here (from multiple perspectives even!). I've been feeling pretty negative about being up here, which I've been trying to confront & work through. It is really comforting to see that I am not alone here AND that it is very possible to find excitement & joy in the differences. I know it is just a little Reddit thread, but reading through, I've felt both warmed & more invigorated to do some more adventuring while I'm away from the islands.

Gov. Josh Green has urged state senators to treat his Cabinet nominees with courtesy and respect, but some senators say it goes both ways after one was called an “idiot” by no less than former Gov. Neil Abercrombie at this week’s confirmation hearing for Ikaika Anderson.

Abercrombie told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that he apologized to state Sen. Jarrett Keohokalole by telephone Friday for calling Keohokalole “an idiot” while seated in the front row of Tuesday’s hearing on Anderson to run the state Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.

Keohokalole told the Star-Advertiser that he accepted Abercrombie’s apology, and both said they hope to move on.

The name-calling of a sitting senator by a former governor in a public hearing, however, underscores the tensions, emotions and pressure around some of Green’s 20 Cabinet appointees and their deputies as Green begins the search for another nominee to run DHHL after Anderson withdrew his name from consideration following the contentious hearing.

DHHL is under incredible public pressure to develop a plan to spend a record $600 million in state funding to help clear the waitlist of 28,000 Hawaiians across the state who have been promised homes.

Keohokalole (D, Kaneohe- Kailua) and state Sen. Les Ihara (D, Palolo-Kaimuki- Moiliili) both voted against recommending Anderson’s confirmation following the five-hour hearing of the Senate Committee on Hawaiian Affairs.

Ihara stood on the floor of the Senate the day after Anderson’s hearing and condemned Abercrombie’s behavior without naming either him or Keohokalole.

Instead, Ihara said that a “former governor” had called out a senator.

“He called him an idiot,” Ihara said. Senate rules ask “that we stand up to protect visitors and senators to this Capitol building from indignities to our humanity.”

Abercrombie considers Anderson his “son,” and Keohokalole said he would expect that his family and friends would be just as passionate in defending him.

But the incident also raises expectations about how Green’s other controversial nominees may be treated in their own separate confirmation hearings.

A “humbled” Abercrombie called his outburst “regretful and unfortunate” and said he hopes that it will help turn down the temperature around Anderson’s successor and other Cabinet appointees.

“Everybody has something to learn,” Abercrombie said. “Hopefully, ironically, I hope a cooler and calmer atmosphere will prevail and the personality drama disappears. I was grateful for his (Keohokalole’s) graciousness.”

Both Keohokalole and Abercrombie acknowledged the emotion and passion around helping Home Lands beneficiaries and hope to focus on that mission.

“Our eyes should be on the prize,” Abercrombie said.

Keohokalole said, “I accept his apology and want to move on. I do not hold against anyone the animosity that’s generated when we in the Senate are critical of people that they love when they are up for vetting and confirmation. It’s a difficult process that I don’t enjoy. I don’t harbor animosity against friends and family members who do not like their loved one being asked hard questions. Civility is a two-way street, and I’m prepared to do my best to be dignified and civil.”

Different Senate committees will hold individual confirmation hearings on Green’s other nominees. It’s unclear whether the hopes of civility by Abercrombie and Keohokalole will come to fruition, said Colin Moore, director of the University of Hawaii’s Public Policy Center.

“Gov. Abercrombie knows his behavior was wrong,” Moore said. “But it goes to show that the atmosphere is very tense around these confirmations. We’re coming up on some others that can be tense as well,” such as Green’s appointees for attorney general and the head of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources.

Moore said the Senate is “not going to be a rubber stamp.”

For nominees, he said, “you are really putting yourself out there for public scrutiny. Any negative things you’ve done in your career are going to come out.”",2023-02-19 06:21:28
3169,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunny, love",Efficiently using a heat pump in a high rise,"Had a bit of a life change recently and I'm befuddled by modern amenities. I've always lived in older crappy ground-floor apartments with window A/C \*at best\* and my usual methods for saving on a power bill seem wrong. I usually run the A/C when it's hot and turn it off / open the windows when it's cooler. I'll jack the temperature higher during the day if we're not home so the system doesn't work as hard to keep things cool.

For heat pumps, the guidance seems to be ""[set it and forget it](https://www.efficiencymaine.com/heat-pump-user-tip-set-it-and-forget-it/)"" but it still feels pretty weird to open the windows with the unit on. We've been maintaining a temperature of 75f with the fan on auto. We open the windows when we wake up (usually 5am) and close them when the outside temp reaches 75 (usually 10am). The unit stays on blowing a very small amount of colder air into the room even when the temperature is lower than 75. This is way different than the window or portable units that have the compressor kicking on and off as it reaches the temperature threshold.

Another thing that may be specific to a high rise: we love the night time temperature in Hawaii and usually slept with windows open and fans going. Doesn't seem to work in a taller building for whatever reason. Last weekend, the outside temp dropped below 75 pretty quickly after the sun went down but despite all the windows open and fans going, the interior of our apartment never got below 80 and was pretty hot/humid when we woke up in the morning. My theory is that the exterior of the building was still warmed from the sun and we caught the rising heat in our windows instead of fresh air.

The remotes and distributors are Carrier branded, the heat pump itself on my lanai is unbranded.

I'm not trying to desperately min/max my power bill but just trying to be efficient while getting as much fresh air outside as possible. Any advice from folks who have a similar setup would be greatly appreciated :)",2023-01-27 17:12:39

“Everybody has something to learn,” Abercrombie said. “Hopefully, ironically, I hope a cooler and calmer atmosphere will prevail and the personality drama disappears. I was grateful for his (Keohokalole’s) graciousness.”

Both Keohokalole and Abercrombie acknowledged the emotion and passion around helping Home Lands beneficiaries and hope to focus on that mission.

“Our eyes should be on the prize,” Abercrombie said.

Keohokalole said, “I accept his apology and want to move on. I do not hold against anyone the animosity that’s generated when we in the Senate are critical of people that they love when they are up for vetting and confirmation. It’s a difficult process that I don’t enjoy. I don’t harbor animosity against friends and family members who do not like their loved one being asked hard questions. Civility is a two-way street, and I’m prepared to do my best to be dignified and civil.”

Different Senate committees will hold individual confirmation hearings on Green’s other nominees. It’s unclear whether the hopes of civility by Abercrombie and Keohokalole will come to fruition, said Colin Moore, director of the University of Hawaii’s Public Policy Center.

“Gov. Abercrombie knows his behavior was wrong,” Moore said. “But it goes to show that the atmosphere is very tense around these confirmations. We’re coming up on some others that can be tense as well,” such as Green’s appointees for attorney general and the head of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources.

Moore said the Senate is “not going to be a rubber stamp.”

For nominees, he said, “you are really putting yourself out there for public scrutiny. Any negative things you’ve done in your career are going to come out.”",2023-02-19 06:21:28

I've always lived in older crappy ground-floor apartments with window A/C \*at best\* and my usual methods for saving on a power bill seem wrong. I usually run the A/C when it's hot and turn it off / open the windows when it's cooler. I'll jack the temperature higher during the day if we're not home so the system doesn't work as hard to keep things cool.

For heat pumps, the guidance seems to be ""[set it and forget it](https://www.efficiencymaine.com/heat-pump-user-tip-set-it-and-forget-it/)"" but it still feels pretty weird to open the windows with the unit on. We've been maintaining a temperature of 75f with the fan on auto. We open the windows when we wake up (usually 5am) and close them when the outside temp reaches 75 (usually 10am). The unit stays on blowing a very small amount of colder air into the room even when the temperature is lower than 75. This is way different than the window or portable units that have the compressor kicking on and off as it reaches the temperature threshold.

Another thing that may be specific to a high rise: we love the night time temperature in Hawaii and usually slept with windows open and fans going. Doesn't seem to work in a taller building for whatever reason. Last weekend, the outside temp dropped below 75 pretty quickly after the sun went down but despite all the windows open and fans going, the interior of our apartment never got below 80 and was pretty hot/humid when we woke up in the morning. My theory is that the exterior of the building was still warmed from the sun and we caught the rising heat in our windows instead of fresh air.

3176,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, love",Hot Take: Supreme Court Striking Down Affirmative Action in College Admissions Benefits Local Filipinos Applying to Colleges on the Mainland,"A very controversial topic here - I'm mostly satisfied with the Supreme Court's decision to strike down affirmative action in college admissions. Why? I believe this will help Filipino Americans from Hawai'i the most.

The issue with affirmative action in American Academia is it ignores the socioeconomic status of overrepresented minorities (aka Asian Americans lol). If you aren't aware, Asian American college applicants tend to be labeled as ORM in the college admissions process (Overrepresented Minorities). Admissions committees at prestigious universities and colleges on the mainland view Asian applicants all the same for the most part.

So what ends up happening is you have a local Filipino kid from a place like Waipahu, Kalihi, Waiʻanae, Wahiawa, etc. that went to a lower-tiered public school with a lower GPA and no extracurricular activity since he probably had to work during school to financially support himself or his family competing against the stereotypical privileged Asian American mainland applicants with kickass resumes, 4.0 GPAs, outstanding extracurriculars, community leadership, etc. That local Filipino kid will have a very difficult time navigating through the college admissions process.

Let's look at this scenario. I will provide two different college applicant profiles.

Applicant #1: Filipino kid from Hawai'i. 3.4 GPA. Graduated from Leilehua HS. Worked at Jack in the Box throughout High School to help financially support his single mother who works as a full-time Janitor. He applies to USC.

Applicant #2: White Latino kid from the Bay Area. 3.6 GPA. Graduated from a decent public school. Played Football and was a part of his school's newspaper. His mom is a nurse and his father is an investment banker. He also applies to USC.

Applicant #2 has more of a likelihood of being accepted to USC (in my opinion) because he is labeled as a ""Latino"" (which is an underrepresented group in academia) even though he grew up with a much more privileged life than the local Filipino kid. The local Filipino kid is then lumped into the same bucket as the rich Japanese kid who graduated from Punahou. So what happens? The local Filipino kid will get his application dumped.

One reason why I love Hawai'i so much is we actually get race right here for the most part. Sure, we have our issues with economic inequality and underrepresentation in leadership for specific ethnic groups like Filipinos, Native Hawaiians, Samoans, Tongans, Micronesians, Vietnamese, etc. BUT at least we culturally understand how different these groups are collectively. Here in Hawai'i, you can find actual stats differentiated by ethnic groups by our local government unlike in the mainland where they just lump everyone into the same Asian American and Pacific Islander statistic. We are not a monolith. These different ethnic groups have their own cultural issues and pain points that deserve their own attention. This is what the Supreme Court ruling from earlier today does - and I hope in the future we can see admissions committees putting more of an emphasis on socioeconomic status rather than race.

I'm excited about what is next for my local Filipino brothers and sisters. We all have a work ethic that can't be matched. I recently went to a Waipahu High School graduation and saw the number of Filipino valedictorians who also graduated with their AAs before earning their high school diplomas. I was very encouraged. I'm glad these kids will now have a fair shot moving forward. This is a big win for us. These are my thoughts and thank you for allowing me to share them. Mahalo.

EDIT: Knew I would get downvoted posting this. Would love to hear your guys' thoughts and would like to hear you refute the unfairness poor Asian Americans have faced being negatively impacted in college admissions throughout the years.",2023-06-29 20:03:26

Gov. Josh Green has urged state senators to treat his Cabinet nominees with courtesy and respect, but some senators say it goes both ways after one was called an “idiot” by no less than former Gov. Neil Abercrombie at this week’s confirmation hearing for Ikaika Anderson.

Abercrombie told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that he apologized to state Sen. Jarrett Keohokalole by telephone Friday for calling Keohokalole “an idiot” while seated in the front row of Tuesday’s hearing on Anderson to run the state Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.

Keohokalole told the Star-Advertiser that he accepted Abercrombie’s apology, and both said they hope to move on.

The name-calling of a sitting senator by a former governor in a public hearing, however, underscores the tensions, emotions and pressure around some of Green’s 20 Cabinet appointees and their deputies as Green begins the search for another nominee to run DHHL after Anderson withdrew his name from consideration following the contentious hearing.

DHHL is under incredible public pressure to develop a plan to spend a record $600 million in state funding to help clear the waitlist of 28,000 Hawaiians across the state who have been promised homes.

Keohokalole (D, Kaneohe- Kailua) and state Sen. Les Ihara (D, Palolo-Kaimuki- Moiliili) both voted against recommending Anderson’s confirmation following the five-hour hearing of the Senate Committee on Hawaiian Affairs.

Ihara stood on the floor of the Senate the day after Anderson’s hearing and condemned Abercrombie’s behavior without naming either him or Keohokalole.

Instead, Ihara said that a “former governor” had called out a senator.

“He called him an idiot,” Ihara said. Senate rules ask “that we stand up to protect visitors and senators to this Capitol building from indignities to our humanity.”

Abercrombie considers Anderson his “son,” and Keohokalole said he would expect that his family and friends would be just as passionate in defending him.

But the incident also raises expectations about how Green’s other controversial nominees may be treated in their own separate confirmation hearings.

A “humbled” Abercrombie called his outburst “regretful and unfortunate” and said he hopes that it will help turn down the temperature around Anderson’s successor and other Cabinet appointees.

I'm reading various biographies of the ali'i and discovering just how *problematic* some of them are, while also being incredibly pivotal some of them were? 

* Like... our boy Prince Jonah Kūnio got his ass arrested at age 24 and, almost executed, but instead put in prison for a year for participating in the Wilcox Rebellion (the counter rebellion), basically, the three-day re-coup d'etat to put his Auntie Liliuokalani back in the throne... Post prison, did a self-exile with his wife and travelled the West, joined the British Army, then came back as the only congressman by age 31? Hot. 
* Princess Ka'iulani was a spoiled rich girl really detached from the soon-to-be overthrown Hawaiian Monarchy frivolously spending her money studying abroad in Europe... but then in a last-ditch recovery act attempts to become heir-apparent and make aristocratic salòn discourse to keep Hawaiian sovereignty? Then I recognize that she was primarily raised by haoles and lost her Hawaiian mother early on, so can only do so much.  
* Forgot that Ka'ahumanu is simultaneously **swamp** **ass** and **bad-ass**? For hardcore assimilating and indoctrinating Christianity into the people and banning hula. *BANNING HULA.* Then again, she effectively toppled the *kapu* system by eating with her sister-wife at her son, Kamehameha II's, mens' only table... not fearing death nor her son killing her? girl was wild. 

**Reason why I ask**... cause rendering these biographies and distilling them into chismis, or essentially tea-spilling, or trash talking, or whatever is helping me remember their accomplishments and failures. More specifically... my kumu hula asked me to reflect on which royal or neighboring island ali'i and to think of them in contemporary ways, where they align on the political spectrum, to what culture and religion/spirituality they valued, their contributions... and the only effective way I've learned is to talk about these stories as if they were some everyday folks?

Besides having to hand deliver a cashier check each month on or before the 1st down in Honolulu which is super annoying.. we have been submitting trouble ticket emails, texts, and phone calls and our issues have not been getting addressed or repaired. 

1. Washer and Dryer were old and stopped working. We were told they would not be replacing it. This was in the rental agreement. We bought our own, but the washer and dryer have been left in the garage for weeks while they 'figure out what to do with it', while it takes up a car spot.. 

2. Our master bathroom sink faucet broke. Not only does it not turn off, the handle is completely broken. So we had to turn off the hot water to the sink. This means I have to shave in the guest bathroom.

3. Our downstairs toilet was ""ghost flushing"" a couple times a day. The handyman 'fixed' it, but now it ghost flushes 2 or 3 times an hour and leaks everywhere. We were told to just turn the water off to the toilet and not use it. It's been over a month. 

4. The roof was leaking during all the rain. So we report and and my wife crawls into the attic and puts my car wash bucket down to catch the water. So now I can't wash my car. 

5. Some smaller issues like a ceiling fan not working correctly.

I normally let me wife handle most of the conversations since I am a bit rough around the edges. I submit a formal notification of the above issues and the response was, ""We have to find someone else as our handyman is too busy."" 

Too busy???

None of these seem to be ""emergent"" so I don't think we can hire outside repair and deduct $500 from rent.. but we'd like to ask if there is anything else we can do? Not having a downstairs bathroom and not having a working master bathroom sink is quite frustrating.. ",2024-11-11 07:17:19

Besides having to hand deliver a cashier check each month on or before the 1st down in Honolulu which is super annoying.. we have been submitting trouble ticket emails, texts, and phone calls and our issues have not been getting addressed or repaired. 

1. Washer and Dryer were old and stopped working. We were told they would not be replacing it. This was in the rental agreement. We bought our own, but the washer and dryer have been left in the garage for weeks while they 'figure out what to do with it', while it takes up a car spot.. 

2. Our master bathroom sink faucet broke. Not only does it not turn off, the handle is completely broken. So we had to turn off the hot water to the sink. This means I have to shave in the guest bathroom.

3. Our downstairs toilet was ""ghost flushing"" a couple times a day. The handyman 'fixed' it, but now it ghost flushes 2 or 3 times an hour and leaks everywhere. We were told to just turn the water off to the toilet and not use it. It's been over a month. 

4. The roof was leaking during all the rain. So we report and and my wife crawls into the attic and puts my car wash bucket down to catch the water. So now I can't wash my car. 

5. Some smaller issues like a ceiling fan not working correctly.

I normally let me wife handle most of the conversations since I am a bit rough around the edges. I submit a formal notification of the above issues and the response was, ""We have to find someone else as our handyman is too busy."" 

Too busy???

None of these seem to be ""emergent"" so I don't think we can hire outside repair and deduct $500 from rent.. but we'd like to ask if there is anything else we can do? Not having a downstairs bathroom and not having a working master bathroom sink is quite frustrating.. ",2024-11-11 07:17:19

3201,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, comfortable",no windshield tinting?,"So I drive for a living, and the uv is starting to do a number on my skin. So i started wearing sunblock on a daily basis. Another problem is leaving your car in the sun, 10 minutes and its too hot for comfort. 

it looks like the law is that you can have four inches of tint from your roof down? I don't understand why it's not allowed for us to have like 5 percent ceramic tint to protect us from the heat and the uv for the entire windshield. The 5 percent ceramic tint reflects a lot more than 5 percent uv and infrared light. The 5 percent is just visible light. I noticed my car gets 20 precent better mpgs when I turn the ac down and point it at my face. So not having a full windshield tint is in no doubt costing more fuel in air conditioning. 

There's absolutely nothing wrong with a 5 percent tint and it barely makes a visible light difference at all. There are tinting materials out there that don't block any visible light, can we put that on the windshield? 

Seems like this no exception, no tinting law, is just outright harmful and wasteful, it's so stupid. ",2023-12-05 05:45:28

3206,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, love",Pro-Rail vs Anti-Rail Debate: I’ve Noticed There Are Primarily Two Types of People Who Hate The Rail…,"I’m pro rail BUT I’m not super crazy passionate about it though. My thoughts on it at this point is that there’s already been some progress made on the project so it might as well be fully finished. I believe stopping The Rail project at The Aloha Stadium and only having it go from Kapolei to ‘Aiea is stupid. I say build the dang thing to Downtown Honolulu and eventually UH Mānoa since that’s where I think the massive investment we poured into this project will only pay off. 

Here’s a little bit of background of myself. I was raised in Central O’ahu and went to public school there. Mid way thru my elementary school days my family moved to the west side. My parents still let me attend elementary, intermediate, and high school in Central O’ahu even though we lived on the west side BUT said I was on my own in getting to and from school. So, I took The Bus and walked everywhere since the age of 9 - to school and summer fun early in the morning and after school late at night after sports practices and club activities. Many of the other parents and my friends’ families thought my mom and dad didn’t love me and were abusive because of this… (what a bunch of privileged clowns). Anyways, this sort of “you’re on your own” thing kinda seeped into everywhere else sort of so as a kid I was very very independent. Every time I went out I had to take The Bus. I never got rides from my parents. I didn’t get to save up and buy a car until I was 21 years old. So, even in my early college years when I was interning in Downtown Honolulu in the late hours at night, I took The Bus to get back home to the west side and sometimes found myself not getting home until 11PM. 

So, because of my background I’m confident in saying I’m pretty well versed in public transportation. After taking The Bus daily for 12 years, I observed and noticed the type of people who used our public transportation system here in Hawai’i - and let me tell you they’re being scapegoated the most out of this whole Rail debate. In my experience, the ones primarily riding The Bus are your older Filipino, Hawaiian, Samoan, and Micronesian uncles and aunties getting off of work in Downtown Honolulu that are heading back home to Waipahu, ‘Ewa Beach, Kapolei, Wai’anae. Y’all really do not know how long it takes to take The Bus from Downtown Honolulu to the west side. It takes forever!!! With all time you take waiting for The Bus, The Bus stopping at literally every single stop, transferring to different busses if needed, walking to locations that don’t have bus stops, etc. it can literally take an hour and a half to two hours to get home. This is in comparison to having a car where it’ll take you maybe half an hour to get home. With The Rail, these other uncles and aunties can get home much much faster. What are the indirect results of this? You’d be surprised: Improved family dynamics. Children’s mental health and success in school is directly linked to the amount of time parents are around the house. If these parents or grandparents can get home quicker, we’ll see improvements in our family and adolescent mental health. This can all trickle down into other statistics like less crimes committed by adolescents, decrease in childhood obesity, increased rates of likelihood of volunteering for non-profits, decrease in high school drop out rates, higher college matriculation rates, etc. 

I wanted to write this post because I noticed there are primarily two types of people who are anti-rail. The first being people who do not trust The City & County of Honolulu and the State of Hawai’i to manage the project. Hey, I don’t blame these people and will not fight them. There are talking points that these individuals make that are valid. We’ve all seen examples of how our local government has botched projects like The Rail, The Aloha Stadium, etc. that lead us to believe they cannot be trusted with our tax dollars. Sure, I get that. My gripes are not with those people though but are with the second type of people I noticed who are anti-rail, the unempathetic folks who were pampered their entire lives and don’t understand the negatives that come with relying so heavily on our current public transportation infrastructure system. When I was a student at UHM we had a rail debate in one of my classes. The professor allowed students to choose sides. I noticed everyone on the anti-rail side were either private school kids, kids who were picked up and dropped off every where by their parents their entire lives, were gifted vehicles when they were in high school, etc. Not a shocker to me btw - the people who have never experienced hardship related to transportation not understanding and lacking empathy for those who do. These people are just so blind and ignorant to what the working class people have to go through. I remember sitting on The Bus daily and just seeing all of these aunties and uncles looking like zombies fighting to stay awake after a long day of work… fortunately for me I was a young energetic man who could survive off barley having any sleep. These type of anti-rail people really don’t know the struggle lol

So, all I’m saying is whether you’re pro-rail or anti-rail, sit back and think who is this really for? Is this rail project being built for me? or is it for someone else? Hey man, I’m a bit of a fiscally conservative person myself who hates high taxes and high cost of living but these old aunties and uncles are all paying taxes too. This is my two cents on the whole rail debate.",2023-06-04 01:24:38

Dont get me wrong the mountains are lovely but only in Spring and Summer. Im not a Fall and Winter kind of guy.

Back to living in Hawaii though. Im only 19 and have a decent savings and would love to try and move over onto one of the islands. I’m just curious if the Big Island feels somewhat like Oahu since id like to try and live on the Big Island. I’m also curious if there’s a stigma about outsiders. Since im only 19 I haven’t set any roots down and would love to try Hawaii. Even if I fail I can still say I lived there. My girlfriend would also be moving with me as she LOVES tropical plants and loves the idea of island life. So that also would bring a second income into the mix.

Gov. Josh Green has urged state senators to treat his Cabinet nominees with courtesy and respect, but some senators say it goes both ways after one was called an “idiot” by no less than former Gov. Neil Abercrombie at this week’s confirmation hearing for Ikaika Anderson.

Abercrombie told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that he apologized to state Sen. Jarrett Keohokalole by telephone Friday for calling Keohokalole “an idiot” while seated in the front row of Tuesday’s hearing on Anderson to run the state Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.

Keohokalole told the Star-Advertiser that he accepted Abercrombie’s apology, and both said they hope to move on.

The name-calling of a sitting senator by a former governor in a public hearing, however, underscores the tensions, emotions and pressure around some of Green’s 20 Cabinet appointees and their deputies as Green begins the search for another nominee to run DHHL after Anderson withdrew his name from consideration following the contentious hearing.

DHHL is under incredible public pressure to develop a plan to spend a record $600 million in state funding to help clear the waitlist of 28,000 Hawaiians across the state who have been promised homes.

Keohokalole (D, Kaneohe- Kailua) and state Sen. Les Ihara (D, Palolo-Kaimuki- Moiliili) both voted against recommending Anderson’s confirmation following the five-hour hearing of the Senate Committee on Hawaiian Affairs.

Ihara stood on the floor of the Senate the day after Anderson’s hearing and condemned Abercrombie’s behavior without naming either him or Keohokalole.

Instead, Ihara said that a “former governor” had called out a senator.

“He called him an idiot,” Ihara said. Senate rules ask “that we stand up to protect visitors and senators to this Capitol building from indignities to our humanity.”

Abercrombie considers Anderson his “son,” and Keohokalole said he would expect that his family and friends would be just as passionate in defending him.

But the incident also raises expectations about how Green’s other controversial nominees may be treated in their own separate confirmation hearings.

A “humbled” Abercrombie called his outburst “regretful and unfortunate” and said he hopes that it will help turn down the temperature around Anderson’s successor and other Cabinet appointees.

“Everybody has something to learn,” Abercrombie said. “Hopefully, ironically, I hope a cooler and calmer atmosphere will prevail and the personality drama disappears. I was grateful for his (Keohokalole’s) graciousness.”

Both Keohokalole and Abercrombie acknowledged the emotion and passion around helping Home Lands beneficiaries and hope to focus on that mission.

“Our eyes should be on the prize,” Abercrombie said.

Keohokalole said, “I accept his apology and want to move on. I do not hold against anyone the animosity that’s generated when we in the Senate are critical of people that they love when they are up for vetting and confirmation. It’s a difficult process that I don’t enjoy. I don’t harbor animosity against friends and family members who do not like their loved one being asked hard questions. Civility is a two-way street, and I’m prepared to do my best to be dignified and civil.”

Different Senate committees will hold individual confirmation hearings on Green’s other nominees. It’s unclear whether the hopes of civility by Abercrombie and Keohokalole will come to fruition, said Colin Moore, director of the University of Hawaii’s Public Policy Center.

“Gov. Abercrombie knows his behavior was wrong,” Moore said. “But it goes to show that the atmosphere is very tense around these confirmations. We’re coming up on some others that can be tense as well,” such as Green’s appointees for attorney general and the head of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources.

Moore said the Senate is “not going to be a rubber stamp.”

For nominees, he said, “you are really putting yourself out there for public scrutiny. Any negative things you’ve done in your career are going to come out.”",2023-02-19 06:21:28

Based on the feedback from people on my last post, I am visiting the Paniolo Preservation Society Museum. I'm having dinner with a long time employee and historian from the Parker Ranch, and plan to stop by the Waimea Vital Statistics office to see if they might be able to help.

If anyone is familiar with Waimea or the ranching community, I'd love to know some places I could visit  where locals might normally hangout. **I'm hoping to strike up some conversations with the elders of the area who might be familiar with at least some of the history I am searching for. Any recommendations on places to visit would be awesome. I know I'm just some random guy coming from the mainland, but from the messages I have received, Hawaii seems to be deeply rooted in family. For me, this trip is about trying to find my family and I hope people will respond positively to that and be open to help!**

Again, my hope is to find some additional pictures of Alex James Napier, try to learn who my great grandmother might have been (my grandfather was most likely born out of wedlock), and maybe, just maybe, learn the story of his secret adoption.

Here's a website I built that sums up everything about the story and what i am looking for ([http://www.georgefamilysearch.com/](http://www.georgefamilysearch.com/))

Also, thank you to everyone who has encouraged me or taken time to help. I can't say how grateful I am for all of you time!",2023-03-04 20:51:06

I've always lived in older crappy ground-floor apartments with window A/C \*at best\* and my usual methods for saving on a power bill seem wrong. I usually run the A/C when it's hot and turn it off / open the windows when it's cooler. I'll jack the temperature higher during the day if we're not home so the system doesn't work as hard to keep things cool.

For heat pumps, the guidance seems to be ""[set it and forget it](https://www.efficiencymaine.com/heat-pump-user-tip-set-it-and-forget-it/)"" but it still feels pretty weird to open the windows with the unit on. We've been maintaining a temperature of 75f with the fan on auto. We open the windows when we wake up (usually 5am) and close them when the outside temp reaches 75 (usually 10am). The unit stays on blowing a very small amount of colder air into the room even when the temperature is lower than 75. This is way different than the window or portable units that have the compressor kicking on and off as it reaches the temperature threshold.

Another thing that may be specific to a high rise: we love the night time temperature in Hawaii and usually slept with windows open and fans going. Doesn't seem to work in a taller building for whatever reason. Last weekend, the outside temp dropped below 75 pretty quickly after the sun went down but despite all the windows open and fans going, the interior of our apartment never got below 80 and was pretty hot/humid when we woke up in the morning. My theory is that the exterior of the building was still warmed from the sun and we caught the rising heat in our windows instead of fresh air.

3216,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, hate",Pro-Rail vs Anti-Rail Debate: I’ve Noticed There Are Primarily Two Types of People Who Hate The Rail…,"I’m pro rail BUT I’m not super crazy passionate about it though. My thoughts on it at this point is that there’s already been some progress made on the project so it might as well be fully finished. I believe stopping The Rail project at The Aloha Stadium and only having it go from Kapolei to ‘Aiea is stupid. I say build the dang thing to Downtown Honolulu and eventually UH Mānoa since that’s where I think the massive investment we poured into this project will only pay off. 

Here’s a little bit of background of myself. I was raised in Central O’ahu and went to public school there. Mid way thru my elementary school days my family moved to the west side. My parents still let me attend elementary, intermediate, and high school in Central O’ahu even though we lived on the west side BUT said I was on my own in getting to and from school. So, I took The Bus and walked everywhere since the age of 9 - to school and summer fun early in the morning and after school late at night after sports practices and club activities. Many of the other parents and my friends’ families thought my mom and dad didn’t love me and were abusive because of this… (what a bunch of privileged clowns). Anyways, this sort of “you’re on your own” thing kinda seeped into everywhere else sort of so as a kid I was very very independent. Every time I went out I had to take The Bus. I never got rides from my parents. I didn’t get to save up and buy a car until I was 21 years old. So, even in my early college years when I was interning in Downtown Honolulu in the late hours at night, I took The Bus to get back home to the west side and sometimes found myself not getting home until 11PM. 

So, because of my background I’m confident in saying I’m pretty well versed in public transportation. After taking The Bus daily for 12 years, I observed and noticed the type of people who used our public transportation system here in Hawai’i - and let me tell you they’re being scapegoated the most out of this whole Rail debate. In my experience, the ones primarily riding The Bus are your older Filipino, Hawaiian, Samoan, and Micronesian uncles and aunties getting off of work in Downtown Honolulu that are heading back home to Waipahu, ‘Ewa Beach, Kapolei, Wai’anae. Y’all really do not know how long it takes to take The Bus from Downtown Honolulu to the west side. It takes forever!!! With all time you take waiting for The Bus, The Bus stopping at literally every single stop, transferring to different busses if needed, walking to locations that don’t have bus stops, etc. it can literally take an hour and a half to two hours to get home. This is in comparison to having a car where it’ll take you maybe half an hour to get home. With The Rail, these other uncles and aunties can get home much much faster. What are the indirect results of this? You’d be surprised: Improved family dynamics. Children’s mental health and success in school is directly linked to the amount of time parents are around the house. If these parents or grandparents can get home quicker, we’ll see improvements in our family and adolescent mental health. This can all trickle down into other statistics like less crimes committed by adolescents, decrease in childhood obesity, increased rates of likelihood of volunteering for non-profits, decrease in high school drop out rates, higher college matriculation rates, etc. 

I wanted to write this post because I noticed there are primarily two types of people who are anti-rail. The first being people who do not trust The City & County of Honolulu and the State of Hawai’i to manage the project. Hey, I don’t blame these people and will not fight them. There are talking points that these individuals make that are valid. We’ve all seen examples of how our local government has botched projects like The Rail, The Aloha Stadium, etc. that lead us to believe they cannot be trusted with our tax dollars. Sure, I get that. My gripes are not with those people though but are with the second type of people I noticed who are anti-rail, the unempathetic folks who were pampered their entire lives and don’t understand the negatives that come with relying so heavily on our current public transportation infrastructure system. When I was a student at UHM we had a rail debate in one of my classes. The professor allowed students to choose sides. I noticed everyone on the anti-rail side were either private school kids, kids who were picked up and dropped off every where by their parents their entire lives, were gifted vehicles when they were in high school, etc. Not a shocker to me btw - the people who have never experienced hardship related to transportation not understanding and lacking empathy for those who do. These people are just so blind and ignorant to what the working class people have to go through. I remember sitting on The Bus daily and just seeing all of these aunties and uncles looking like zombies fighting to stay awake after a long day of work… fortunately for me I was a young energetic man who could survive off barley having any sleep. These type of anti-rail people really don’t know the struggle lol

So, all I’m saying is whether you’re pro-rail or anti-rail, sit back and think who is this really for? Is this rail project being built for me? or is it for someone else? Hey man, I’m a bit of a fiscally conservative person myself who hates high taxes and high cost of living but these old aunties and uncles are all paying taxes too. This is my two cents on the whole rail debate.",2023-06-04 01:24:38

Gov. Josh Green has urged state senators to treat his Cabinet nominees with courtesy and respect, but some senators say it goes both ways after one was called an “idiot” by no less than former Gov. Neil Abercrombie at this week’s confirmation hearing for Ikaika Anderson.

Abercrombie told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that he apologized to state Sen. Jarrett Keohokalole by telephone Friday for calling Keohokalole “an idiot” while seated in the front row of Tuesday’s hearing on Anderson to run the state Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.

Keohokalole told the Star-Advertiser that he accepted Abercrombie’s apology, and both said they hope to move on.

The name-calling of a sitting senator by a former governor in a public hearing, however, underscores the tensions, emotions and pressure around some of Green’s 20 Cabinet appointees and their deputies as Green begins the search for another nominee to run DHHL after Anderson withdrew his name from consideration following the contentious hearing.

DHHL is under incredible public pressure to develop a plan to spend a record $600 million in state funding to help clear the waitlist of 28,000 Hawaiians across the state who have been promised homes.

Keohokalole (D, Kaneohe- Kailua) and state Sen. Les Ihara (D, Palolo-Kaimuki- Moiliili) both voted against recommending Anderson’s confirmation following the five-hour hearing of the Senate Committee on Hawaiian Affairs.

Ihara stood on the floor of the Senate the day after Anderson’s hearing and condemned Abercrombie’s behavior without naming either him or Keohokalole.

Instead, Ihara said that a “former governor” had called out a senator.

“He called him an idiot,” Ihara said. Senate rules ask “that we stand up to protect visitors and senators to this Capitol building from indignities to our humanity.”

Abercrombie considers Anderson his “son,” and Keohokalole said he would expect that his family and friends would be just as passionate in defending him.

But the incident also raises expectations about how Green’s other controversial nominees may be treated in their own separate confirmation hearings.

A “humbled” Abercrombie called his outburst “regretful and unfortunate” and said he hopes that it will help turn down the temperature around Anderson’s successor and other Cabinet appointees.

“Everybody has something to learn,” Abercrombie said. “Hopefully, ironically, I hope a cooler and calmer atmosphere will prevail and the personality drama disappears. I was grateful for his (Keohokalole’s) graciousness.”

Both Keohokalole and Abercrombie acknowledged the emotion and passion around helping Home Lands beneficiaries and hope to focus on that mission.

“Our eyes should be on the prize,” Abercrombie said.

Keohokalole said, “I accept his apology and want to move on. I do not hold against anyone the animosity that’s generated when we in the Senate are critical of people that they love when they are up for vetting and confirmation. It’s a difficult process that I don’t enjoy. I don’t harbor animosity against friends and family members who do not like their loved one being asked hard questions. Civility is a two-way street, and I’m prepared to do my best to be dignified and civil.”

Different Senate committees will hold individual confirmation hearings on Green’s other nominees. It’s unclear whether the hopes of civility by Abercrombie and Keohokalole will come to fruition, said Colin Moore, director of the University of Hawaii’s Public Policy Center.

“Gov. Abercrombie knows his behavior was wrong,” Moore said. “But it goes to show that the atmosphere is very tense around these confirmations. We’re coming up on some others that can be tense as well,” such as Green’s appointees for attorney general and the head of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources.

Moore said the Senate is “not going to be a rubber stamp.”

For nominees, he said, “you are really putting yourself out there for public scrutiny. Any negative things you’ve done in your career are going to come out.”",2023-02-19 06:21:28

Dont get me wrong the mountains are lovely but only in Spring and Summer. Im not a Fall and Winter kind of guy. But Ive always loved the idea of living somewhere warm year round and even tropical since I’m a waterbaby. 

Back to living in Hawaii though. Im only 19 and have a decent savings and would love to try and move over onto one of the islands. I’m just curious if the Big Island feels somewhat like Oahu since id like to try and live on the Big Island. I’m also curious if there’s a stigma about outsiders. Since im only 19 I haven’t set any roots down and would love to try Hawaii. Even if I fail I can still say I lived there. My girlfriend would also be moving with me as she LOVES tropical plants and loves the idea of island life. So that also would bring a second income into the mix.

We’re coming up on some others that can be tense as well,” such as Green’s appointees for attorney general and the head of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources.

Moore said the Senate is “not going to be a rubber stamp.”

For nominees, he said, “you are really putting yourself out there for public scrutiny. Any negative things you’ve done in your career are going to come out.”",2023-02-19 06:21:28

I’m haole, my wife is Filipina and once we went to lunch with another couple, both haole.

Cantonese, to me, always sounds like fighting.  My F’d up perception but that’s how it sounds to me.   Cantonese always sounds like fighting.  

All the waitresses at McCully Chop Suey spoke Cantonese and they would bark at you while you ordered.  They weren’t angry, it was just how they sounded to me.  Besides it was part of the whole chop suey vibe and it was fun expecting to be snapped at.  

We ordered a bunch of food and as we were eating I called the waitress to our table.  

“We did not get everything we ordered.  We are missing a dish.”

Server (highly agitated):  “YOU GET EVERYTING! EVERYTING YOU ORDER YOU GET!”

“Can you bring me a menu please.”

Disgusted, server comes back with a menu.  

I point to spicy eggplant. “We ordered spicy eggplant.   We did not get.”

“RIGHT THERE!!!”  She points to a plate of eggplant on the table.  

I said “We ordered spicy eggplant.  This eggplant not spicy.  No more taste.”

I swear to god she barked:
“HAOLE NO MAKE SPICY!”

“HAOLE NO MAKE SPICY!”

“HAOLE NO MAKE SPICY??”

“HAOLE NO MAKE SPICY!  LOSE MONEY!  HAOLE ORDER SPICY, WE MAKE SPICY, HAOLE ALWAYS SEND BACK COMPLAIN TOO SPICY!  LOSE MONEY! HAOLE NO MAKE SPICY!”.

3237,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, heat, enjoy",Abercrombie outburst highlights tensions with Gov. Green Nominees,"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2023/02/18/hawaii-news/abercrombie-outburst-highlights-stress-with-gov-green-nominees/

Gov. Josh Green has urged state senators to treat his Cabinet nominees with courtesy and respect, but some senators say it goes both ways after one was called an “idiot” by no less than former Gov. Neil Abercrombie at this week’s confirmation hearing for Ikaika Anderson.

Abercrombie told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that he apologized to state Sen. Jarrett Keohokalole by telephone Friday for calling Keohokalole “an idiot” while seated in the front row of Tuesday’s hearing on Anderson to run the state Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.

Keohokalole told the Star-Advertiser that he accepted Abercrombie’s apology, and both said they hope to move on.

The name-calling of a sitting senator by a former governor in a public hearing, however, underscores the tensions, emotions and pressure around some of Green’s 20 Cabinet appointees and their deputies as Green begins the search for another nominee to run DHHL after Anderson withdrew his name from consideration following the contentious hearing.

DHHL is under incredible public pressure to develop a plan to spend a record $600 million in state funding to help clear the waitlist of 28,000 Hawaiians across the state who have been promised homes.

Keohokalole (D, Kaneohe- Kailua) and state Sen. Les Ihara (D, Palolo-Kaimuki- Moiliili) both voted against recommending Anderson’s confirmation following the five-hour hearing of the Senate Committee on Hawaiian Affairs.

Ihara stood on the floor of the Senate the day after Anderson’s hearing and condemned Abercrombie’s behavior without naming either him or Keohokalole.

Instead, Ihara said that a “former governor” had called out a senator.

“He called him an idiot,” Ihara said. Senate rules ask “that we stand up to protect visitors and senators to this Capitol building from indignities to our humanity.”

Abercrombie considers Anderson his “son,” and Keohokalole said he would expect that his family and friends would be just as passionate in defending him.

But the incident also raises expectations about how Green’s other controversial nominees may be treated in their own separate confirmation hearings.

A “humbled” Abercrombie called his outburst “regretful and unfortunate” and said he hopes that it will help turn down the temperature around Anderson’s successor and other Cabinet appointees.

“Everybody has something to learn,” Abercrombie said. “Hopefully, ironically, I hope a cooler and calmer atmosphere will prevail and the personality drama disappears. I was grateful for his (Keohokalole’s) graciousness.”

Both Keohokalole and Abercrombie acknowledged the emotion and passion around helping Home Lands beneficiaries and hope to focus on that mission.

“Our eyes should be on the prize,” Abercrombie said.

Keohokalole said, “I accept his apology and want to move on. I do not hold against anyone the animosity that’s generated when we in the Senate are critical of people that they love when they are up for vetting and confirmation. It’s a difficult process that I don’t enjoy. I don’t harbor animosity against friends and family members who do not like their loved one being asked hard questions. Civility is a two-way street, and I’m prepared to do my best to be dignified and civil.”

Different Senate committees will hold individual confirmation hearings on Green’s other nominees. It’s unclear whether the hopes of civility by Abercrombie and Keohokalole will come to fruition, said Colin Moore, director of the University of Hawaii’s Public Policy Center.

“Gov. Abercrombie knows his behavior was wrong,” Moore said. “But it goes to show that the atmosphere is very tense around these confirmations.

I'm from Colorado, which qualifies me for the Western Undergraduate Exchange program. Does anyone have anything to share about their experiences at these colleges to help me pick which one I should attend for this major? I'm most concerned about the marine bio programs the colleges have over anything else, but I can't decide which one will be most beneficial to me. Thanks for the help y'all!

UPDATE (Jan 13, 2024): A lot of you guys are also mentioning to attend UH Hilo that doesn't offer marine biology, but rather offers a ""marine science"" major. What is the difference between marine science and marine biology? Every description I look at for marine science is exceedingly vague and I can't tell which major would best fit what I'm interested in. What I plan to do with my degree is to get into genetic engineering: I wanna genetically modify coral reefs to withstand ocean acidification and gain heat resistance to mitigate the effects of climate change and global warming to prevent bleaching events. Based on this short description of what I want to do, what are your thoughts of where I should attend?

P.S. please do not bash my major / future career plans for the amount of money they will make. I'm financially able to handle myself just fine wherever I go. Besides, I rather be happy doing what I love for the rest of my life helping the planet prosper, rather than regretting not chasing my dreams stuck with a different major I could get almost anywhere. Most of the schools I have applied to are more expensive to attend than Hawaii anyways (California and Florida).",2024-01-11 04:22:17

it looks like the law is that you can have four inches of tint from your roof down? I don't understand why it's not allowed for us to have like 5 percent ceramic tint to protect us from the heat and the uv for the entire windshield. The 5 percent ceramic tint reflects a lot more than 5 percent uv and infrared light. The 5 percent is just visible light. I noticed my car gets 20 precent better mpgs when I turn the ac down and point it at my face. So not having a full windshield tint is in no doubt costing more fuel in air conditioning. 

There's absolutely nothing wrong with a 5 percent tint and it barely makes a visible light difference at all. There are tinting materials out there that don't block any visible light, can we put that on the windshield?

For heat pumps, the guidance seems to be ""[set it and forget it](https://www.efficiencymaine.com/heat-pump-user-tip-set-it-and-forget-it/)"" but it still feels pretty weird to open the windows with the unit on. We've been maintaining a temperature of 75f with the fan on auto. We open the windows when we wake up (usually 5am) and close them when the outside temp reaches 75 (usually 10am). The unit stays on blowing a very small amount of colder air into the room even when the temperature is lower than 75. This is way different than the window or portable units that have the compressor kicking on and off as it reaches the temperature threshold.

Another thing that may be specific to a high rise: we love the night time temperature in Hawaii and usually slept with windows open and fans going.

Last weekend, the outside temp dropped below 75 pretty quickly after the sun went down but despite all the windows open and fans going, the interior of our apartment never got below 80 and was pretty hot/humid when we woke up in the morning.

Gov. Josh Green has urged state senators to treat his Cabinet nominees with courtesy and respect, but some senators say it goes both ways after one was called an “idiot” by no less than former Gov. Neil Abercrombie at this week’s confirmation hearing for Ikaika Anderson.

Abercrombie told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that he apologized to state Sen. Jarrett Keohokalole by telephone Friday for calling Keohokalole “an idiot” while seated in the front row of Tuesday’s hearing on Anderson to run the state Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.

Keohokalole told the Star-Advertiser that he accepted Abercrombie’s apology, and both said they hope to move on.

The name-calling of a sitting senator by a former governor in a public hearing, however, underscores the tensions, emotions and pressure around some of Green’s 20 Cabinet appointees and their deputies as Green begins the search for another nominee to run DHHL after Anderson withdrew his name from consideration following the contentious hearing.

DHHL is under incredible public pressure to develop a plan to spend a record $600 million in state funding to help clear the waitlist of 28,000 Hawaiians across the state who have been promised homes.

Keohokalole (D, Kaneohe- Kailua) and state Sen. Les Ihara (D, Palolo-Kaimuki- Moiliili) both voted against recommending Anderson’s confirmation following the five-hour hearing of the Senate Committee on Hawaiian Affairs.

Ihara stood on the floor of the Senate the day after Anderson’s hearing and condemned Abercrombie’s behavior without naming either him or Keohokalole.

Instead, Ihara said that a “former governor” had called out a senator.

“He called him an idiot,” Ihara said. Senate rules ask “that we stand up to protect visitors and senators to this Capitol building from indignities to our humanity.”

Abercrombie considers Anderson his “son,” and Keohokalole said he would expect that his family and friends would be just as passionate in defending him.

But the incident also raises expectations about how Green’s other controversial nominees may be treated in their own separate confirmation hearings.

A “humbled” Abercrombie called his outburst “regretful and unfortunate” and said he hopes that it will help turn down the temperature around Anderson’s successor and other Cabinet appointees.

“Everybody has something to learn,” Abercrombie said. “Hopefully, ironically, I hope a cooler and calmer atmosphere will prevail and the personality drama disappears. I was grateful for his (Keohokalole’s) graciousness.”

Both Keohokalole and Abercrombie acknowledged the emotion and passion around helping Home Lands beneficiaries and hope to focus on that mission.

“Our eyes should be on the prize,” Abercrombie said.

Keohokalole said, “I accept his apology and want to move on. I do not hold against anyone the animosity that’s generated when we in the Senate are critical of people that they love when they are up for vetting and confirmation. It’s a difficult process that I don’t enjoy. I don’t harbor animosity against friends and family members who do not like their loved one being asked hard questions. Civility is a two-way street, and I’m prepared to do my best to be dignified and civil.”

Different Senate committees will hold individual confirmation hearings on Green’s other nominees. It’s unclear whether the hopes of civility by Abercrombie and Keohokalole will come to fruition, said Colin Moore, director of the University of Hawaii’s Public Policy Center.

“Gov. Abercrombie knows his behavior was wrong,” Moore said. “But it goes to show that the atmosphere is very tense around these confirmations. We’re coming up on some others that can be tense as well,” such as Green’s appointees for attorney general and the head of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources.

Moore said the Senate is “not going to be a rubber stamp.”

For nominees, he said, “you are really putting yourself out there for public scrutiny. Any negative things you’ve done in your career are going to come out.”",2023-02-19 06:21:28

I was/am born and raised in Idaho. I live in a smaller city with a population under 100k. I’ve never really felt 100% in place here. Dont get me wrong the mountains are lovely but only in Spring and Summer. Im not a Fall and Winter kind of guy. But Ive always loved the idea of living somewhere warm year round and even tropical since I’m a waterbaby. 

Back to living in Hawaii though. Im only 19 and have a decent savings and would love to try and move over onto one of the islands. I’m just curious if the Big Island feels somewhat like Oahu since id like to try and live on the Big Island. I’m also curious if there’s a stigma about outsiders. Since im only 19 I haven’t set any roots down and would love to try Hawaii. Even if I fail I can still say I lived there. My girlfriend would also be moving with me as she LOVES tropical plants and loves the idea of island life. So that also would bring a second income into the mix.

Gov. Josh Green has urged state senators to treat his Cabinet nominees with courtesy and respect, but some senators say it goes both ways after one was called an “idiot” by no less than former Gov. Neil Abercrombie at this week’s confirmation hearing for Ikaika Anderson.

Abercrombie told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that he apologized to state Sen. Jarrett Keohokalole by telephone Friday for calling Keohokalole “an idiot” while seated in the front row of Tuesday’s hearing on Anderson to run the state Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.

Keohokalole told the Star-Advertiser that he accepted Abercrombie’s apology, and both said they hope to move on.

The name-calling of a sitting senator by a former governor in a public hearing, however, underscores the tensions, emotions and pressure around some of Green’s 20 Cabinet appointees and their deputies as Green begins the search for another nominee to run DHHL after Anderson withdrew his name from consideration following the contentious hearing.

DHHL is under incredible public pressure to develop a plan to spend a record $600 million in state funding to help clear the waitlist of 28,000 Hawaiians across the state who have been promised homes.

Keohokalole (D, Kaneohe- Kailua) and state Sen. Les Ihara (D, Palolo-Kaimuki- Moiliili) both voted against recommending Anderson’s confirmation following the five-hour hearing of the Senate Committee on Hawaiian Affairs.

Ihara stood on the floor of the Senate the day after Anderson’s hearing and condemned Abercrombie’s behavior without naming either him or Keohokalole.

Instead, Ihara said that a “former governor” had called out a senator.

“He called him an idiot,” Ihara said. Senate rules ask “that we stand up to protect visitors and senators to this Capitol building from indignities to our humanity.”

Abercrombie considers Anderson his “son,” and Keohokalole said he would expect that his family and friends would be just as passionate in defending him.

But the incident also raises expectations about how Green’s other controversial nominees may be treated in their own separate confirmation hearings.

A “humbled” Abercrombie called his outburst “regretful and unfortunate” and said he hopes that it will help turn down the temperature around Anderson’s successor and other Cabinet appointees.

“Everybody has something to learn,” Abercrombie said. “Hopefully, ironically, I hope a cooler and calmer atmosphere will prevail and the personality drama disappears. I was grateful for his (Keohokalole’s) graciousness.”

Both Keohokalole and Abercrombie acknowledged the emotion and passion around helping Home Lands beneficiaries and hope to focus on that mission.

“Our eyes should be on the prize,” Abercrombie said.

Keohokalole said, “I accept his apology and want to move on. I do not hold against anyone the animosity that’s generated when we in the Senate are critical of people that they love when they are up for vetting and confirmation. It’s a difficult process that I don’t enjoy. I don’t harbor animosity against friends and family members who do not like their loved one being asked hard questions. Civility is a two-way street, and I’m prepared to do my best to be dignified and civil.”

Different Senate committees will hold individual confirmation hearings on Green’s other nominees. It’s unclear whether the hopes of civility by Abercrombie and Keohokalole will come to fruition, said Colin Moore, director of the University of Hawaii’s Public Policy Center.

“Gov. Abercrombie knows his behavior was wrong,” Moore said. “But it goes to show that the atmosphere is very tense around these confirmations. We’re coming up on some others that can be tense as well,” such as Green’s appointees for attorney general and the head of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources.

Moore said the Senate is “not going to be a rubber stamp.”

For nominees, he said, “you are really putting yourself out there for public scrutiny. Any negative things you’ve done in your career are going to come out.”",2023-02-19 06:21:28
3269,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, warm, hate","Locals that moved to the mainland, how did you cope?","Born & raised Hawai'i, moved about 2 years ago to work, and its been great for my finances, not so great for my mental.

It's the small things I miss, and it's the small things that pain me. I'm making this post because I want to ask those of you who were maybe born & raised HI, but moved to the mainland at some point, how did you cope?

I'm tired of the microcorrections to pidgin slip-ups (brah I miss shooting the shit in pidgin), constantly being asked for ""permission"" to visit the islands (LMFAOO), actionless Maui sympathizers that really just want to tell me all about their last trip to the islands, and guys, weeaboos up here are something else. In Hawai'i I felt it was easier for me to join in on the jokes around weeb culture, but here, sometimes it gets creepy. Speaking of jokes- there is some sense of humor between the locals I've met here that I just don't understand. Some people I've met would poke fun at others by putting them down, or making backhanded remarks which, maybe to them seems like an obvious joke, but to me falls flat on the curve of humor. Theres more to my frustrations, but I'm really just seeking advice, so I don't want this to be a bigger rant.

At first I thought I just hated these fakas, but I think I just don't understand them. I don't get the humor, my lived experiences with Hawai'i are different & longer than their week long vacays, and the culture here is just different. And really my biggest problem is, I don't want to understand them.

For locals that moved to the mainland at some point, what were some things that helped you adjust/be more open-minded? Bonus question: did you move back to the islands?

EDIT:
Thank you to all the kind and open comments sharing your advice/stories. I got pulled aside to do something for work so I haven't been able to respond to everyone, but I have been reading the thread and will continue to read through it & respond where can.

It's been really nice to reminisce with & learn from the mo'olelo shared here (from multiple perspectives even!). I've been feeling pretty negative about being up here, which I've been trying to confront & work through. It is really comforting to see that I am not alone here AND that it is very possible to find excitement & joy in the differences. I know it is just a little Reddit thread, but reading through, I've felt both warmed & more invigorated to do some more adventuring while I'm away from the islands.

When I was young, my dad was in the army and was station in Honolulu, so I was very fortunate to live for four years in Hawaii. My favorite snack from Hawaii was Musubi. My mom hated making it because no one else in the family likes it besides me, so I only got to eat it on rare occasions when my friends moms made it. Well fast forward a life time, long after i forgot about my favorite childhood snack, I was walking through the grocery store and I looked near the bottom of the shelf and I saw a can of spam. All of a sudden I was reminded of over twenty years ago with the breeze coming up off of the ocean, the warm sun in the sky, and the sand on my feet. I decided to buy the spam and some nori, and I never thought such a simple snack could bring me so much joy. I am a 6’3” tall white man, covered in tattoos, I’ve worked construction, I drove a semi truck for years, and I wear flannels and blue jeans nearly year round now. But for a moment, I was five years old again, and I was dancing in the kitchen with my musubi. I know this post is silly, but I’ve never had any food have such a profound effect on me. So thank you to Hawaii. Thank you to the people. Thank you for treating a chubby little white boy like family and making him feel at home.",2023-03-12 18:28:36

I'm specifically wondering and asking about whem the transition from canned to fresh happened for those who grew up on Hawaii. Because for many people I know of similar age, our families bought fresh or canned for our earliest years, then at some point (intermediate or high school - so sometime in the 80s?), we transitioned from canned and fresh to frozen and fresh.  But maybe that wasore a socio economic thing (working class or immigrant families) and maybe more affluent families at the time got frozen veg earlier. Or maybe frozen veg just wasn't so much a thing in Hawaii supearlets until the 80s? 

When do you remember starting to buy (or your parents buying) frozen veggies versus canned? My husband and I were talking about how inferior canned veggies (particularly corn, peas, and green beans) are to frozen, and how much we hated canned veggies when we were school aged. But we can't remember when our parents started buying frozen. We just know we liked frozen so much better. Even now, we have corn, peas, green beans, gobo, kale, kabocha, and lotus root (also poi!) in our freezer. 

I still do have warm nostalgic feelings for canned asparagus w/shoyu shichimi mayo...a sentiment my beloved does not share.

So yeah: do you recall when frozen veg became part of your groceries? And if you want to share a frozen veg recipe, please do! I'll share a couple of mine in comments. Mahalos!

I'm most concerned about the marine bio programs the colleges have over anything else, but I can't decide which one will be most beneficial to me. Thanks for the help y'all!

UPDATE (Jan 13, 2024): A lot of you guys are also mentioning to attend UH Hilo that doesn't offer marine biology, but rather offers a ""marine science"" major. What is the difference between marine science and marine biology? Every description I look at for marine science is exceedingly vague and I can't tell which major would best fit what I'm interested in. What I plan to do with my degree is to get into genetic engineering: I wanna genetically modify coral reefs to withstand ocean acidification and gain heat resistance to mitigate the effects of climate change and global warming to prevent bleaching events. Based on this short description of what I want to do, what are your thoughts of where I should attend?

P.S. please do not bash my major / future career plans for the amount of money they will make. I'm financially able to handle myself just fine wherever I go. Besides, I rather be happy doing what I love for the rest of my life helping the planet prosper, rather than regretting not chasing my dreams stuck with a different major I could get almost anywhere.

I visited Oahu back in January with my family. I honestly wasn’t 100% keen on going but I supposed it would be an experience. As soon as we got out if the airport I fell in love. I loved the sense of community anywhere you go and how happy everyone seemed to be. 

I was/am born and raised in Idaho. I live in a smaller city with a population under 100k. I’ve never really felt 100% in place here. Dont get me wrong the mountains are lovely but only in Spring and Summer. Im not a Fall and Winter kind of guy. But Ive always loved the idea of living somewhere warm year round and even tropical since I’m a waterbaby. 

Back to living in Hawaii though. Im only 19 and have a decent savings and would love to try and move over onto one of the islands. I’m just curious if the Big Island feels somewhat like Oahu since id like to try and live on the Big Island. I’m also curious if there’s a stigma about outsiders. Since im only 19 I haven’t set any roots down and would love to try Hawaii. Even if I fail I can still say I lived there. My girlfriend would also be moving with me as she LOVES tropical plants and loves the idea of island life. So that also would bring a second income into the mix.

I don’t know if it’s Hawaii fever that I’ve got. But it love to hear any input from you guys!",2023-06-04 03:05:39

Doesn't seem to work in a taller building for whatever reason. Last weekend, the outside temp dropped below 75 pretty quickly after the sun went down but despite all the windows open and fans going, the interior of our apartment never got below 80 and was pretty hot/humid when we woke up in the morning. My theory is that the exterior of the building was still warmed from the sun and we caught the rising heat in our windows instead of fresh air.

The remotes and distributors are Carrier branded, the heat pump itself on my lanai is unbranded.

I'm not trying to desperately min/max my power bill but just trying to be efficient while getting as much fresh air outside as possible. Any advice from folks who have a similar setup would be greatly appreciated :)",2023-01-27 17:12:39

It's the small things I miss, and it's the small things that pain me. I'm making this post because I want to ask those of you who were maybe born & raised HI, but moved to the mainland at some point, how did you cope?

I'm tired of the microcorrections to pidgin slip-ups (brah I miss shooting the shit in pidgin), constantly being asked for ""permission"" to visit the islands (LMFAOO), actionless Maui sympathizers that really just want to tell me all about their last trip to the islands, and guys, weeaboos up here are something else. In Hawai'i I felt it was easier for me to join in on the jokes around weeb culture, but here, sometimes it gets creepy. Speaking of jokes- there is some sense of humor between the locals I've met here that I just don't understand. Some people I've met would poke fun at others by putting them down, or making backhanded remarks which, maybe to them seems like an obvious joke, but to me falls flat on the curve of humor. Theres more to my frustrations, but I'm really just seeking advice, so I don't want this to be a bigger rant.

At first I thought I just hated these fakas, but I think I just don't understand them. I don't get the humor, my lived experiences with Hawai'i are different & longer than their week long vacays, and the culture here is just different. And really my biggest problem is, I don't want to understand them.

For locals that moved to the mainland at some point, what were some things that helped you adjust/be more open-minded? Bonus question: did you move back to the islands?

EDIT:
Thank you to all the kind and open comments sharing your advice/stories. I got pulled aside to do something for work so I haven't been able to respond to everyone, but I have been reading the thread and will continue to read through it & respond where can.

It's been really nice to reminisce with & learn from the mo'olelo shared here (from multiple perspectives even!). I've been feeling pretty negative about being up here, which I've been trying to confront & work through. It is really comforting to see that I am not alone here AND that it is very possible to find excitement & joy in the differences. I know it is just a little Reddit thread, but reading through, I've felt both warmed & more invigorated to do some more adventuring while I'm away from the islands.

Mahalo nui loa again to you all for sharing your aloha through your stories and suggestions.",2023-09-04 17:40:18

3291,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunshine, love",Abercrombie outburst highlights tensions with Gov. Green Nominees,"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2023/02/18/hawaii-news/abercrombie-outburst-highlights-stress-with-gov-green-nominees/

Gov. Josh Green has urged state senators to treat his Cabinet nominees with courtesy and respect, but some senators say it goes both ways after one was called an “idiot” by no less than former Gov. Neil Abercrombie at this week’s confirmation hearing for Ikaika Anderson.

Abercrombie told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that he apologized to state Sen. Jarrett Keohokalole by telephone Friday for calling Keohokalole “an idiot” while seated in the front row of Tuesday’s hearing on Anderson to run the state Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.

Keohokalole told the Star-Advertiser that he accepted Abercrombie’s apology, and both said they hope to move on.

The name-calling of a sitting senator by a former governor in a public hearing, however, underscores the tensions, emotions and pressure around some of Green’s 20 Cabinet appointees and their deputies as Green begins the search for another nominee to run DHHL after Anderson withdrew his name from consideration following the contentious hearing.

DHHL is under incredible public pressure to develop a plan to spend a record $600 million in state funding to help clear the waitlist of 28,000 Hawaiians across the state who have been promised homes.

Keohokalole (D, Kaneohe- Kailua) and state Sen. Les Ihara (D, Palolo-Kaimuki- Moiliili) both voted against recommending Anderson’s confirmation following the five-hour hearing of the Senate Committee on Hawaiian Affairs.

Ihara stood on the floor of the Senate the day after Anderson’s hearing and condemned Abercrombie’s behavior without naming either him or Keohokalole.

Instead, Ihara said that a “former governor” had called out a senator.

“He called him an idiot,” Ihara said. Senate rules ask “that we stand up to protect visitors and senators to this Capitol building from indignities to our humanity.”

Abercrombie considers Anderson his “son,” and Keohokalole said he would expect that his family and friends would be just as passionate in defending him.

But the incident also raises expectations about how Green’s other controversial nominees may be treated in their own separate confirmation hearings.

A “humbled” Abercrombie called his outburst “regretful and unfortunate” and said he hopes that it will help turn down the temperature around Anderson’s successor and other Cabinet appointees.

“Everybody has something to learn,” Abercrombie said. “Hopefully, ironically, I hope a cooler and calmer atmosphere will prevail and the personality drama disappears. I was grateful for his (Keohokalole’s) graciousness.”

Both Keohokalole and Abercrombie acknowledged the emotion and passion around helping Home Lands beneficiaries and hope to focus on that mission.

“Our eyes should be on the prize,” Abercrombie said.

Keohokalole said, “I accept his apology and want to move on. I do not hold against anyone the animosity that’s generated when we in the Senate are critical of people that they love when they are up for vetting and confirmation. It’s a difficult process that I don’t enjoy. I don’t harbor animosity against friends and family members who do not like their loved one being asked hard questions. Civility is a two-way street, and I’m prepared to do my best to be dignified and civil.”

Different Senate committees will hold individual confirmation hearings on Green’s other nominees. It’s unclear whether the hopes of civility by Abercrombie and Keohokalole will come to fruition, said Colin Moore, director of the University of Hawaii’s Public Policy Center.

“Gov. Abercrombie knows his behavior was wrong,” Moore said. “But it goes to show that the atmosphere is very tense around these confirmations. We’re coming up on some others that can be tense as well,” such as Green’s appointees for attorney general and the head of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources.

Moore said the Senate is “not going to be a rubber stamp.”

For nominees, he said, “you are really putting yourself out there for public scrutiny. Any negative things you’ve done in your career are going to come out.”",2023-02-19 06:21:28
