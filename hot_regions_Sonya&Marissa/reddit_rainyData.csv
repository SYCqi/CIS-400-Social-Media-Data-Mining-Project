1,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, love",Best lesser known things to do in florida?,"Hey everyone! I wanted to get on here and see what everyone does for fun, get some fresh ideas of things to do on my days off. I live in miami, dive, spearfishing and kiteboard often, I've hit literally every museum within 2 hours and love to explore. Off the top of my head I was considering giving foraging a try. I'm sure the whole community would love a florida bucket list of activities as much as I would! Any input is appreciated.
Have a fun and safe weekend :)

Edit: also would love some ideas of things to do when the weather isn't perfect. Rainy season coming up and would love to still get out on weekends and have fun!",2023-08-17 23:53:17
2,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, love",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

3,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, love",Visiting Florida in June?,"We are getting married in June and would love to honeymoon in Florida. However reading about it it seems like a rainy month and it makes me think it might not be the best time to visit? I have visited once in April (or February or March I can't remember, it was a family trip when I was a kid)  and then the weather was lovely.

Does it rain all day every day with cloudy skies or what does it look like?

We plan on mainly visiting beaches, swimming, reading, enjoying the sun, laying by the pool etc. with maybe some day trips to maybe a botanical garden, maybe disney and such. But mainly the beach. We would also like to go on a Caribbean Cruise for one week.

Please give me some advice! I would really like to go to Florida but maybe it's better to visit some other time of year?

EDIT: Can add that we are thinking about maybe Key West and that we are from Sweden so if it rains where we are from it will usually rain all day long. And 22-25 degrees celsius is warm for us.",2024-01-19 14:28:44

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19

8,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, love",I love Florida,"I love Florida so much. The beautiful land, springs, wildlife, weather (hurricanes🙂), sun..I can go on. I love it here. I don't own much so I'm not intimidated by the climate, and I was born and raised here. I just have been feeling sad by the things happening with the people.

I feel like we are not taking care of Florida. We are changing it into something unenjoyable. I feel like some people are caught up in making Florida ""theirs"", when in reality, Florida is for not just one. Florida is a piece of land that is extremely diverse in plants and animals. Florida is for observation only.

I think Florida should be protected from demolition. We should all protect Florida from the bleaching that some people are bringing. The plants and animals can't vote or talk, so we need to do it for them. Protect Florida!!!!!!!!!!!",2023-05-12 18:59:29
9,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, love","People love to hate on Florida, but is it actually that bad? ","FL can be crazy, that’s for sure. But I find it entertaining whenever I visit. I live in CT where it’s great and safe but so uneventful it gets boring/depressing, especially since it’s cold from Oct-April. So whenever I visit FL (Tampa Bay and Miami) I feel “alive”. From what I’ve seen is just a normal state where people live normal lives, nothing out of this world. I’m sure it’s different when you live there. Besides the weather, what’s so bad about it? 

Edit: to those telling me not to move to FL just for the heck of it, I will come and give you a long hug under the sun mid-August. Don’t test me. ",2024-08-02 20:43:22
10,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, love",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

15,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, love",Has anybody here actually left Florida? Where did you end up moving and did you like it?,"Not sure what other subreddit to post this one, so if you know a better subreddit, let me know.

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

But I have this fear, it always seems like everybody is talking about leaving Florida, but they never seem to actually do it.  Furthermore, people who do, it often seems like they end up back in short time.  One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.  

So what I am asking here, is there any success stories from former Floridians who moved away and loved it? Or just anybody who can share some experiences? I deeply fear falling into the ""grass is greener"" trap, but then finding out the grass is yellow everywhere.  But I do feel like in my heart of hearts deep down I should relocate before my mental sanity flies off the handle in extremely crowded and busy area I live.",2023-04-30 17:30:36

19,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, love",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

32,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, love",Just did a great work trip through Florida! What a cool state.,"Hello Floridians of Reddit!

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I’m 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami’s airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! 👀 wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I’ve ever been too, and I’ve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I’ve ever experienced; and I’ve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I’m going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I’m heading to Tampa which I’m very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! 😋

Anywho, just wanted to holler and tell you how cool I thought this state was, not being in the touristy Orlando spots. I hope to come down here and go camping in panther country some day. I had no idea panther crossing were a real thing before today?! I’m just blown away with how much there is to do, and eat down here–it’s endless! What a cool f’n place. It was 35* and snowing when I left Utah. Y’all have it to good!",2023-03-23 21:46:57

The COL is lower than NYC, and that was super appealing as well. 

When I visited my sister in October, I liked how it felt like vacation…but was kind of uncomfortable. The humidity was insane, my allergies were on max, and I was itchy as soon as I walked out the door. 

My sister is trying to convince me to move down to Orlando where she lives, but she makes nearly 6 figures in a remote position in a company based in NYC. I don’t make that much money. She’s trying to sell me a dream and tells me I’m “scared” and overthinking when I think I’m being cautious lol. I also have to consider expenses. 

My other options are Northern Virginia, DC, PA, NJ. 

I was looking through the sub and instead of asking about pros and cons, tell me why you’re leaving. I’d love to hear from those of you who moved from the Northeast and are leaving the state. 

Mostly so that I can give my sister actual reasons she can’t argue about because she can’t take “no” as an answer.

I know I’ll get downvoted based on “we’re full!” Lol 😂

EDIT: this post isn’t to “edge the haters.” I saw a post and someone commented, “don’t ask why you should come here, ask why people are leaving.”

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating. I'd be giving up everything I love, even down to the food, weather, and geography.

41,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, love",Please Help Us Understand How Communities Respond to Disasters!,"Hi Reddit! 👋 We're participating in a hackathon focused on improving community resilience during natural disasters, and we need your insights! When extreme weather events hit—floods, hurricanes, wildfires—evacuations and rescues become critical, but sometimes, resources and helping hands are limited. We're exploring ideas to strengthen our communities and would love to hear from you.

**The Concept:** Imagine a community where, in times of disaster, those with the means (vehicles, boats, safe spaces) not only ensure their own evacuation but also assist others in need. This support wouldn’t just be voluntary; there would be incentives—things like tax breaks, gift cards, or community points that could be redeemed for local benefits.

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **If you had resources to help during a disaster (like a truck, extra room, etc.), would incentives motivate you to help others evacuate?**
2. **What types of incentives do you think would encourage people in your community to step up in times of crisis?**
3. **What barriers would prevent you from helping others in a disaster situation?**
4. **What’s one thing you think your community could do better to be prepared for an emergency?**

Your feedback could help shape a new solution that empowers communities to be more resilient in the face of climate challenges. If you have personal stories, ideas, or thoughts on the incentives system, please drop a comment below!

55,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

58,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, hate",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

Im finishing 3 months this year in Silicon Valley for another internship.

I have to know, what is with all the hatred on this sub? Some of the common points I see when people are hating on Fl are 1) cost of living, 2) weather, 3) insurance companies leaving.

.....do you people realize all these things are like 10x worse in California?

cost of living, forget about it, insurance, forget about it, weather? how many years have these wildfires been happening?

For christs sake, you people have NO INCOME TAX!!!! Only a handful of states in the US have this privilege, and florida is the only one with good beaches. No income tax, wonderful destinations, plenty of jobs, yall have alot to be grateful for.  Id KILL for no income tax, thats literally a gift from god. Most people have to fight tooth and nail to evade taxes, but your government just hands it to you on a silver platter. Ive lived in florida, and ive lived in the sapphire blue toilet bowl on the other side of the country, trust me, Id take FL any day.

Im not trying to paint this as a left or right thing, I identify as socially left and economically right, so I am  not taking a side here. but seriously yall need to appreciate what you have that us in other states (CA, NC,SC) dont have at all.

I understand some of yall dont like desantis and dont like his social policy, fair enough (although that new alimony law should have won some of you socially left people over, alimony is a patriarchal construct in the first place)

but come on, what NON-SOCIAL (I repeat, NON-SOCIAL) policies do you have or not have in florida that you think california does better? as someone whos lived in both, Im genuinely curious

77,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06

Florida is essentially developed swampland, sure but Florida has a desirable climate, low taxes, and lots of corporations are moving here. Home prices here have gone up FASTER than the average ever since the invention of home air conditioning, florida has always had more inflow for most of y’all’s lives, for a reason.

I own a cabin in Anchorage AK, I bought it to fish, and avoid paying taxes on a work bonus. I’d kill myself if I had to live there. Believe it or not, but most people don’t like the cold. Most of the land area in the US gets pretty cold(below freezing lows for at least 1/3 of the year) and people are free to spend their money and move wherever they want.

Supply and demand forces are at play, many of us who are not homeowners may never own a home here, it sucks BIG, but that’s how it works. Same shit happened in Hawaii, bulldozed native homes to build ostentatious beachfront homes, LA, San Diego, Phoenix, Arizona, you think you’re special?. That’s just the name of game, jit. That’s how capitalism works. Prices don’t go up because it sucks living here. The brutal winters in NYC sucked asshole. The summer “nights” at the cabin suck asshole.

Every place with a appealing climate is gonna get rocked with not affordable CoL, that’s how it works, that’s how it has worked and it’s how it will always work.

Don’t have a gripe because people want to live in a nicer place, with nicer weather, with nicer tax treatment. That’s petty, makes you look childish.

If you’re dead set on hating someone because you’ll never own a home here, hate Airbnb, OpenDoor, and Zillow, don’t hate people because they see an opportunity to live a better life, fuck that.

89,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, enjoy",What has happened to Florida?,"I grew up in FL and moved away when I was 20. While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous. 

What happened to Florida? Its literally become the playground for the far right. I dont even associate it with Publix, alligators, oranges, beaches, dolphins and Jimmy Buffett music anymore.",2023-07-03 14:00:21

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19

92,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, enjoy",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.
 
I’m curious what you all have to say.",2024-06-12 14:37:32

Things have definitely changed a lot since the Pre-Desantis days, and especially following the devastation from Hurricane Ian, but is it really *that* bad? Is there a chance the state will become politically moderate again as it was in the past, or has the anti-LGBT lunacy really taken over the majority of the population? Just about every post/comment here is filled with negativity about the political situation, and it seems like the political shift is mostly due to the northern region (which has always been conservative), and the number of older people moving there since Covid. I've considered moving back at some point for the Tropical Weather and beaches, possibly around Broward County or elsewhere in SEFL which is fairly liberal, and I'm also wondering how things have changed there.

96,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, enjoy",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating. I'd be giving up everything I love, even down to the food, weather, and geography.

104,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, enjoy",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

3. Terrible weather - hate the winter
4. No job opportunities

I am looking for a place where I can move with my gf (who is studying to be a dentist) to start a family. More specifically, a family friendly neighborhood.

I've visited Florida (Tampa) last August and I really loved it. Enjoyed the weather, talked to many locals who were very nice and welcoming. From my experience, Florida seems like the place to go.

I'd only be able to move there by getting a TN visa from a work sponsorship. 

My questions to you are:

1. What are the biggest cons that I might face for a person in my position?
2. What city/region would you recommend for me to move to?
3. Do you think there's another state that would better suit me?",2023-04-24 22:05:38

I visited Miami, Orlando and the Everglades many years ago, I’m not interested in the Keys so this time I was thinking about driving along the gulf coast. I’m not into clubs and nightlife, I’d rather visit not too crowded towns, enjoy big spaces and the weather, have walks along the waterfront etc.

I know everything gets expensive during the season that’s why I should start booking hotel rooms.

Also I’m traveling with my small dog so I appreciate it if you can tell me dog friendly cities and beaches along the road, and any recommendations on cities where to sleep, especially for New Year’s Eve evening.",2023-03-18 07:21:43
126,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, dislike",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.
 
I’m curious what you all have to say.",2024-06-12 14:37:32

131,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, dislike",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

I’ve never been shown a greater amount of disrespect by the general public than on a bicycle. Nobody yields, nobody gives space, people will purposely vroom past you, it seriously felt like I was vilified by society like I was some murderer.

No i wasn’t one of those annoying bicyclists that ride in the middle of the road or one that has a chip on their shoulder. I’m 20 years old, riding my bike to the library or a friends house so I can go use the computer to do schoolwork because I can’t do it at home. I always rode on the sidewalk whenever possible but there’s sometimes no sidewalk. And I’ve almost been hit a couple of times. Dead before I can legally drink because I don’t have a car was a wild thought. I will never ever ride a bike on public areas again.

https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/s/zPy0XbmLln

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19
157,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, happy",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.
 
I’m curious what you all have to say.",2024-06-12 14:37:32

162,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, happy",Happy Hurricane Season!,"Hurricane season starts June 1, and this one will be a doozy.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03
163,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US – all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07

165,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, happy",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

Please give me some advice! I would really like to go to Florida but maybe it's better to visit some other time of year?

169,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‘Dial *FHP for emergency’.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‘soon’.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it’s not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can’t see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‘escorting’ a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‘wide load’ sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm…) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while…. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, “Now that you’ve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?”  The response: “Sir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.” I’ll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy’s awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don’t need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‘fund raiser mode’, but the time I actually need one?

BTW- the inside of a lighting bolt is bright yellow.",2023-08-06 19:47:46

182,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rainy, annoyed",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing.

208,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, wet, love",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

211,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, wet, love",Has anybody here actually left Florida? Where did you end up moving and did you like it?,"Not sure what other subreddit to post this one, so if you know a better subreddit, let me know.

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

But I have this fear, it always seems like everybody is talking about leaving Florida, but they never seem to actually do it.  Furthermore, people who do, it often seems like they end up back in short time.  One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.  

So what I am asking here, is there any success stories from former Floridians who moved away and loved it? Or just anybody who can share some experiences? I deeply fear falling into the ""grass is greener"" trap, but then finding out the grass is yellow everywhere.  But I do feel like in my heart of hearts deep down I should relocate before my mental sanity flies off the handle in extremely crowded and busy area I live.",2023-04-30 17:30:36

214,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, wet, love",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

228,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, wet, love",Just did a great work trip through Florida! What a cool state.,"Hello Floridians of Reddit!

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I’m 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami’s airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! 👀 wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I’ve ever been too, and I’ve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I’ve ever experienced; and I’ve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I’m going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I’m heading to Tampa which I’m very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! 😋

Anywho, just wanted to holler and tell you how cool I thought this state was, not being in the touristy Orlando spots. I hope to come down here and go camping in panther country some day. I had no idea panther crossing were a real thing before today?! I’m just blown away with how much there is to do, and eat down here–it’s endless! What a cool f’n place.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03

238,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, wet, love",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

When extreme weather events hit—floods, hurricanes, wildfires—evacuations and rescues become critical, but sometimes, resources and helping hands are limited. We're exploring ideas to strengthen our communities and would love to hear from you.

**The Concept:** Imagine a community where, in times of disaster, those with the means (vehicles, boats, safe spaces) not only ensure their own evacuation but also assist others in need. This support wouldn’t just be voluntary; there would be incentives—things like tax breaks, gift cards, or community points that could be redeemed for local benefits.

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **If you had resources to help during a disaster (like a truck, extra room, etc.), would incentives motivate you to help others evacuate?**
2. **What types of incentives do you think would encourage people in your community to step up in times of crisis?**
3. **What barriers would prevent you from helping others in a disaster situation?**
4. **What’s one thing you think your community could do better to be prepared for an emergency?**

Your feedback could help shape a new solution that empowers communities to be more resilient in the face of climate challenges. If you have personal stories, ideas, or thoughts on the incentives system, please drop a comment below!

ive previously asked for an explanation on what happens if the solution gets wet again, whether it be rain or shower moisture or anything else. ive also asked what happens if a cat eats a lizard that been eating bugs. ive never gotten a satisfactory answer - which may just be my own ignorance and paranoia... but it all makes me very nervous. 

i always find dead lizards for a few weeks after they spray outside by the pool. these arent mammals, but theyre not bugs, either. 

this company comes quarterly but i havent let them spray in the house for at least a year, nor inside the caged pool patio where the cats hang out. they do spray around the outside of the house and in the garage. 

so - recently ive been finding tiny ants in my primary bathroom and theyre starting to branch out, as im finding little dead ones elsewhere. 

i adopted two cats last fall. one is ~four years old and the other is eight months. the adult cat doesnt eat things she shouldnt, but the baby excessively sniffs and licks _everything_ like a dog. floors, walls, the other cat’s butt - if it has any smell, he is into it. he also LOVES water and gets in the showers and sinks a lot. 

i hate florida bugs enough that i pay for a pest service but tbh the health of my cats (and me) is more important. 

are pesticides actually safe for people and pets? should i let the company spray inside - or even just in my bathroom - even though my cats love it in there and the baby licks water everywhere he can find it? is there a safer, ant-specific option i should try for now? ",2024-05-08 17:23:43

259,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, wet, hate",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating. I'd be giving up everything I love, even down to the food, weather, and geography.

274,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, wet, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

276,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, wet, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06

Born here, bought a house here, sold a house here, moved to NYC, moved back and now I can’t afford a comparable house because mine went up 175% since I sold it in 2019.

Florida is essentially developed swampland, sure but Florida has a desirable climate, low taxes, and lots of corporations are moving here. Home prices here have gone up FASTER than the average ever since the invention of home air conditioning, florida has always had more inflow for most of y’all’s lives, for a reason.

I own a cabin in Anchorage AK, I bought it to fish, and avoid paying taxes on a work bonus. I’d kill myself if I had to live there. Believe it or not, but most people don’t like the cold. Most of the land area in the US gets pretty cold(below freezing lows for at least 1/3 of the year) and people are free to spend their money and move wherever they want.

Supply and demand forces are at play, many of us who are not homeowners may never own a home here, it sucks BIG, but that’s how it works. Same shit happened in Hawaii, bulldozed native homes to build ostentatious beachfront homes, LA, San Diego, Phoenix, Arizona, you think you’re special?. That’s just the name of game, jit. That’s how capitalism works. Prices don’t go up because it sucks living here. The brutal winters in NYC sucked asshole. The summer “nights” at the cabin suck asshole.

Every place with a appealing climate is gonna get rocked with not affordable CoL, that’s how it works, that’s how it has worked and it’s how it will always work.

Don’t have a gripe because people want to live in a nicer place, with nicer weather, with nicer tax treatment. That’s petty, makes you look childish.

If you’re dead set on hating someone because you’ll never own a home here, hate Airbnb, OpenDoor, and Zillow, don’t hate people because they see an opportunity to live a better life, fuck that.

Snowbirds though… fuck em(because they don’t contribute to society and drive like crap) but once again, what can you do, they got the money, they’re gonna do what they’re gonna do.",2023-01-15 03:22:03
279,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, wet, hate",pesticides inside: are they actually pet safe?,"i use a professional pest control company. they insist their products are pet and child safe as soon as its dry, which they say takes about two hours. 

ive previously asked for an explanation on what happens if the solution gets wet again, whether it be rain or shower moisture or anything else. ive also asked what happens if a cat eats a lizard that been eating bugs. ive never gotten a satisfactory answer - which may just be my own ignorance and paranoia... but it all makes me very nervous. 

i always find dead lizards for a few weeks after they spray outside by the pool. these arent mammals, but theyre not bugs, either. 

this company comes quarterly but i havent let them spray in the house for at least a year, nor inside the caged pool patio where the cats hang out. they do spray around the outside of the house and in the garage. 

so - recently ive been finding tiny ants in my primary bathroom and theyre starting to branch out, as im finding little dead ones elsewhere. 

i adopted two cats last fall. one is ~four years old and the other is eight months. the adult cat doesnt eat things she shouldnt, but the baby excessively sniffs and licks _everything_ like a dog. floors, walls, the other cat’s butt - if it has any smell, he is into it. he also LOVES water and gets in the showers and sinks a lot. 

i hate florida bugs enough that i pay for a pest service but tbh the health of my cats (and me) is more important. 

are pesticides actually safe for people and pets? should i let the company spray inside - or even just in my bathroom - even though my cats love it in there and the baby licks water everywhere he can find it? is there a safer, ant-specific option i should try for now? ",2024-05-08 17:23:43

We live at West Bay Village off on 192 and 5 minutes away from animal kingdom. This place seemed perfect until one week into living there, the toilet over flowed while I was at work. Ever since then we’ve had a leaking toilet. We have called maintenance to fix it and they never permanently fix it. We’ve heard they put other tenants up in a hotel fully paid for, for having the same issue, but they had my partner vacuuming up the water in our own apartment after calling maintenance. They just keep caulking the leak and it keeps lifting. The power goes out occasionally, the wifi will be out for days at a time. The grassy areas are loaded with animal feces. Last week there was a sewage leak and there was wet and used toilet paper in the grass for days. In the laundry room, there must have been a leak because ceiling tiles fell out and remain on top of the dryers covered in mold. The pool was demolished in February I believe, we were told it would take 2-3 weeks to fix and after pouring the concrete the pool has not been worked on in three weeks. The elevator works when it wants to and hasn’t passed an inspection since 2020. There is caution tape around the peppery on things that need fixing or are broken yet nothing has been done (the tape was put there in December.)

While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous.

Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

Is there a chance the state will become politically moderate again as it was in the past, or has the anti-LGBT lunacy really taken over the majority of the population? Just about every post/comment here is filled with negativity about the political situation, and it seems like the political shift is mostly due to the northern region (which has always been conservative), and the number of older people moving there since Covid.

291,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, wet, enjoy",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

294,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, wet, enjoy",Happy Hurricane Season!,"Hurricane season starts June 1, and this one will be a doozy.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating.

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

My fiancé and I are getting married in September, and he really really really wants to honeymoon in Florida. Originally we were going to do Vegas, but we are going there in October for a concert anyway, so he doesn’t wanna “double dip” and wants to go somewhere different. 

I’ve never been outside of the western half of the United States other than Germany, and am very used to mountains and alligator free lakes, and I’ve never seen the ocean. But the part I’m worried about the most is the HUMIDITY and wet heat. My state (Montana) is dry heat. So it’s usually more manageable. 

I am a *large* woman and the whitest of white without being a redhead, so I’m concerned about getting swamp ass (that I already get here in the summer) and being miserable the whole trip. 

And though I am excited about seeing the ocean, I’m also terrified of it and probably wouldn’t want to go more than ankle deep because of sharks lol. (I bet I would look like a real nice fat seal) though my fiancé says he’s gonna convince me lol. 

I’m just wondering where in the state is the prettiest as far as beaches go, but also not completely PACKED with people? And what time of year would be best to go to avoid crazy heat and tons of people? We may not honeymoon directly after the wedding, we may wait till after the new year. I’m aware it’s Florida and it’s gonna be busy either way, but I would love to be able to enjoy the beach and stuff without 1000 other people the same day lol. 

Also what kind of tourist stuff would be recommended? Because of my size, I probably wouldn’t fit on a lot of the rides at Disney, so unsure about going there. 

Would you recommend to stay at a resort or a hotel? What should I avoid? Please just give me a good rundown so I can hopefully actually enjoy my time. We will be going for somewhere between 5-7 days.

I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing.

If you are new to Florida, be careful if you go out into an area this morning with flood waters. The water can be deceptive in depth, and debris underneath can be hidden. Also PLEASE watch for downed power lines. THEY CAN STILL BE LIVE. DO NOT TOUCH THEM OR GET NEAR THEM.

338,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, wet, happy",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why?

340,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, wet, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US – all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07

343,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, wet, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‘Dial *FHP for emergency’.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‘soon’.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it’s not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can’t see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‘escorting’ a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‘wide load’ sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm…) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while…. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, “Now that you’ve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?”  The response: “Sir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.” I’ll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy’s awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don’t need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‘fund raiser mode’, but the time I actually need one?

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything.

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03

362,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, love",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

However reading about it it seems like a rainy month and it makes me think it might not be the best time to visit?

Please give me some advice! I would really like to go to Florida but maybe it's better to visit some other time of year?

Here's a link to one of the news articles. Basically the Community has storm drains that the easement runs next to this woman's property and it needed repairs from the sounds of it. From what I have read it sounds like she bought the property in 2012 and the storm drainage system was put in in the 1980s, her argument is they didn't ask permission from her to put in the storm drains. So she single-handedly required everybody in the neighborhood to purchase flood insurance.

I'm just posting this because I'm astonished that someone can get away with damaging public infrastructure and it's a civil matter rather than criminal even though many homeowners have been harmed because of her actions.

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside!

Many thanks again!!

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table.

384,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, love",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

385,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, love",Moved to Miami and here’s my Take. (Warning),"So after living and Moving out of Miami here’s my not so great take on it.
*Low Pay high cost of living/Slave State
(I felt like I worked in an all inclusive)
*Vacation vs Living here is completely different 
(I obviously expected this but it’s really really different.)
*People say the “N” word a lot like overtly
* Driving reminded me of driving in Costa Rica obviously better paved but really reckless.
* A lot of Spanish which was good because I knew a bit and learned a lot.
*Service wise people try to take advantage of you almost all the time.
*The weather is Brutal
(The constant heat, rain, floods, hurricane warnings which they make it seem like the worlds going to end and puts your nerves on edge) Did I mention flood driving… Anxiety on a new level lol
*Mosquitos run in packs and I’ve never been so bit up in my life, keep bug spray on you.
*Top 10 Cockroach infestation in the country
* People weren’t the kindest out here that’s for sure and I was treated super weird going into certain restaurants not knowing Spanish.
*Allergies
(I hardly have allergies but apparently the mold due to the high humidity and pollen was pretty intense)
This seems to be what I was told which it’s a great retirement place.
I recently moved out, went back to where I can pay 1400 for a 1 bedroom, Make more money, save money and visit Miami for a few weeks and head back home to continue saving money for my retirement. Moving there was a whirlwind and if you can make it out there good for you but nothing in the world would make me want to move back unless I hit the lotto and even then I don’t like the hurricanes and flooding so I’d still probably pass and only vacation there. You’ll loose years of your life trying to keep up with bills along with the lifestyle.
Anyways this is my personal experience, I thought I’d share just in case someone was looking into moving there. 
Oh also the employment market is overtly saturated, keep in mind that about 22Million people live in Florida so they can easily find someone to underpay for the position you applied for and they have people lined up for it.

It does not make it easier to see you. Are you distressed? Pull over. The driving in this state is always entertaining

Edit: Thanks for making this post blowup, I’ve never had so many comments before, this was fun.

I retract my “It does not make it easier to see you” comment, touché it does make it easier to see, however, I still think it’s a terrible idea and can cause confusion in an already hazardous situation. It’s not advisable by experts. 

Florida made it legal is 2021 to drive with hazards on roads 55mph in unsafe driving conditions, just because it’s a law here, doesn’t mean it’s best practice.

I love the questions of “why does this bother you” cause it was a Sunday night and I felt like addressing something trivial in the grand scheme of things but also unsafe.

Lastly, if you have to drive slower, that’s what the right lane is for or if you have to go really slow, pull over and wait it out, you probably shouldn’t be driving. ",2023-12-10 23:36:36

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

But I have this fear, it always seems like everybody is talking about leaving Florida, but they never seem to actually do it.  Furthermore, people who do, it often seems like they end up back in short time.  One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.  

So what I am asking here, is there any success stories from former Floridians who moved away and loved it? Or just anybody who can share some experiences? I deeply fear falling into the ""grass is greener"" trap, but then finding out the grass is yellow everywhere.  But I do feel like in my heart of hearts deep down I should relocate before my mental sanity flies off the handle in extremely crowded and busy area I live.",2023-04-30 17:30:36

I've been so focused on my disgust of DeSantis and the policy makers here, the school board in Sarasota where my children go to school and so on that I've stopped taking time to appreciate some of the special things about Florida that I love.  So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

Here's a link to one of the news articles. Basically the Community has storm drains that the easement runs next to this woman's property and it needed repairs from the sounds of it. From what I have read it sounds like she bought the property in 2012 and the storm drainage system was put in in the 1980s, her argument is they didn't ask permission from her to put in the storm drains. So she single-handedly required everybody in the neighborhood to purchase flood insurance.

419,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, hate",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

420,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, hate",Moved to Miami and here’s my Take. (Warning),"So after living and Moving out of Miami here’s my not so great take on it.
*Low Pay high cost of living/Slave State
(I felt like I worked in an all inclusive)
*Vacation vs Living here is completely different 
(I obviously expected this but it’s really really different.)
*People say the “N” word a lot like overtly
* Driving reminded me of driving in Costa Rica obviously better paved but really reckless.
* A lot of Spanish which was good because I knew a bit and learned a lot.
*Service wise people try to take advantage of you almost all the time.
*The weather is Brutal
(The constant heat, rain, floods, hurricane warnings which they make it seem like the worlds going to end and puts your nerves on edge) Did I mention flood driving… Anxiety on a new level lol
*Mosquitos run in packs and I’ve never been so bit up in my life, keep bug spray on you.
*Top 10 Cockroach infestation in the country
* People weren’t the kindest out here that’s for sure and I was treated super weird going into certain restaurants not knowing Spanish.
*Allergies
(I hardly have allergies but apparently the mold due to the high humidity and pollen was pretty intense)
This seems to be what I was told which it’s a great retirement place.
I recently moved out, went back to where I can pay 1400 for a 1 bedroom, Make more money, save money and visit Miami for a few weeks and head back home to continue saving money for my retirement. Moving there was a whirlwind and if you can make it out there good for you but nothing in the world would make me want to move back unless I hit the lotto and even then I don’t like the hurricanes and flooding so I’d still probably pass and only vacation there. You’ll loose years of your life trying to keep up with bills along with the lifestyle.
Anyways this is my personal experience, I thought I’d share just in case someone was looking into moving there. 
Oh also the employment market is overtly saturated, keep in mind that about 22Million people live in Florida so they can easily find someone to underpay for the position you applied for and they have people lined up for it.

So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

freaking love it out there",2023-07-19 15:00:23

429,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, hate",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

Im finishing 3 months this year in Silicon Valley for another internship.

.....do you people realize all these things are like 10x worse in California?

cost of living, forget about it, insurance, forget about it, weather? how many years have these wildfires been happening?

For christs sake, you people have NO INCOME TAX!!!! Only a handful of states in the US have this privilege, and florida is the only one with good beaches. No income tax, wonderful destinations, plenty of jobs, yall have alot to be grateful for.  Id KILL for no income tax, thats literally a gift from god. Most people have to fight tooth and nail to evade taxes, but your government just hands it to you on a silver platter. Ive lived in florida, and ive lived in the sapphire blue toilet bowl on the other side of the country, trust me, Id take FL any day.

Im not trying to paint this as a left or right thing, I identify as socially left and economically right, so I am  not taking a side here. but seriously yall need to appreciate what you have that us in other states (CA, NC,SC) dont have at all.

I understand some of yall dont like desantis and dont like his social policy, fair enough (although that new alimony law should have won some of you socially left people over, alimony is a patriarchal construct in the first place)

but come on, what NON-SOCIAL (I repeat, NON-SOCIAL) policies do you have or not have in florida that you think california does better? as someone whos lived in both, Im genuinely curious

Not just that it's cool, but I live for being able to leave my windows open.  Even when it's cold I have them cracked.  But then the temps begin to edge up and suddenly highs are in the upper 80s.  Then it's time to batten down the hatches, knowing that I won't be able to open my windows for at least another 7 months, until after Halloween or later.  

I don't hate the summer and I love Florida all year round.  But I especially love the cool air -- being able to smell flowers, listen to birds without the sound of the A/C, smell the rain, have a fresh breeze blowing thru.

going to visit Florida for the first time in September. I'm from Germany and have no other time so it has to be then. I'm a bit scared of Hurrican season but i try to stay positive.

On the last days we stay in Sarasota and Tampa and then heading back to Orlando.

  
Only things we have planned to maybe visit a Dolphins game (currently the prices are really high) and maybe a Bucs game. Maybe Disneyland too.

Dream would be also to do a snorkeling trip but I don't know how the weather will be.

And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.

447,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

449,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06

Sure,  I disagree with it, it's always democratic point of view. There doesn't seem to be any republican points of view. However,  I want to point out that there is more to it than politics 

Personally,  I love Florida. Albeit it I'm from totally different state more northern.  The weather is perfect. The temperature is great,  people are nice,  nothing is ""forced"" politics,  or religion. I'm enjoying a lot of the perks here. Housing is decent,  untilies aren't outrageous.

Born here, bought a house here, sold a house here, moved to NYC, moved back and now I can’t afford a comparable house because mine went up 175% since I sold it in 2019.

I’m 37 and I live with my parents. I make 67,000 a year and cannot afford my own place, I SHOULD HATE transplants according to y’all’s, but guess what? I don’t. You know why? Because that’s the name of the game, that’s right.

Florida is essentially developed swampland, sure but Florida has a desirable climate, low taxes, and lots of corporations are moving here. Home prices here have gone up FASTER than the average ever since the invention of home air conditioning, florida has always had more inflow for most of y’all’s lives, for a reason.

I own a cabin in Anchorage AK, I bought it to fish, and avoid paying taxes on a work bonus. I’d kill myself if I had to live there. Believe it or not, but most people don’t like the cold. Most of the land area in the US gets pretty cold(below freezing lows for at least 1/3 of the year) and people are free to spend their money and move wherever they want.

Supply and demand forces are at play, many of us who are not homeowners may never own a home here, it sucks BIG, but that’s how it works. Same shit happened in Hawaii, bulldozed native homes to build ostentatious beachfront homes, LA, San Diego, Phoenix, Arizona, you think you’re special?. That’s just the name of game, jit. That’s how capitalism works. Prices don’t go up because it sucks living here. The brutal winters in NYC sucked asshole. The summer “nights” at the cabin suck asshole.

Every place with a appealing climate is gonna get rocked with not affordable CoL, that’s how it works, that’s how it has worked and it’s how it will always work.

Don’t have a gripe because people want to live in a nicer place, with nicer weather, with nicer tax treatment. That’s petty, makes you look childish.

If you’re dead set on hating someone because you’ll never own a home here, hate Airbnb, OpenDoor, and Zillow, don’t hate people because they see an opportunity to live a better life, fuck that.

Snowbirds though… fuck em(because they don’t contribute to society and drive like crap) but once again, what can you do, they got the money, they’re gonna do what they’re gonna do.",2023-01-15 03:22:03

i always find dead lizards for a few weeks after they spray outside by the pool. these arent mammals, but theyre not bugs, either. 

this company comes quarterly but i havent let them spray in the house for at least a year, nor inside the caged pool patio where the cats hang out. they do spray around the outside of the house and in the garage. 

so - recently ive been finding tiny ants in my primary bathroom and theyre starting to branch out, as im finding little dead ones elsewhere. 

i adopted two cats last fall. one is ~four years old and the other is eight months. the adult cat doesnt eat things she shouldnt, but the baby excessively sniffs and licks _everything_ like a dog. floors, walls, the other cat’s butt - if it has any smell, he is into it. he also LOVES water and gets in the showers and sinks a lot. 

i hate florida bugs enough that i pay for a pest service but tbh the health of my cats (and me) is more important. 

are pesticides actually safe for people and pets? should i let the company spray inside - or even just in my bathroom - even though my cats love it in there and the baby licks water everywhere he can find it? is there a safer, ant-specific option i should try for now? ",2024-05-08 17:23:43

466,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, enjoy",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal.

He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough.

Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though.

I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.
 
I’m curious what you all have to say.",2024-06-12 14:37:32
482,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, enjoy",Moved to Miami and here’s my Take. (Warning),"So after living and Moving out of Miami here’s my not so great take on it.
*Low Pay high cost of living/Slave State
(I felt like I worked in an all inclusive)
*Vacation vs Living here is completely different 
(I obviously expected this but it’s really really different.)
*People say the “N” word a lot like overtly
* Driving reminded me of driving in Costa Rica obviously better paved but really reckless.
* A lot of Spanish which was good because I knew a bit and learned a lot.
*Service wise people try to take advantage of you almost all the time.
*The weather is Brutal
(The constant heat, rain, floods, hurricane warnings which they make it seem like the worlds going to end and puts your nerves on edge) Did I mention flood driving… Anxiety on a new level lol
*Mosquitos run in packs and I’ve never been so bit up in my life, keep bug spray on you.
*Top 10 Cockroach infestation in the country
* People weren’t the kindest out here that’s for sure and I was treated super weird going into certain restaurants not knowing Spanish.
*Allergies
(I hardly have allergies but apparently the mold due to the high humidity and pollen was pretty intense)
This seems to be what I was told which it’s a great retirement place.
I recently moved out, went back to where I can pay 1400 for a 1 bedroom, Make more money, save money and visit Miami for a few weeks and head back home to continue saving money for my retirement. Moving there was a whirlwind and if you can make it out there good for you but nothing in the world would make me want to move back unless I hit the lotto and even then I don’t like the hurricanes and flooding so I’d still probably pass and only vacation there. You’ll loose years of your life trying to keep up with bills along with the lifestyle.
Anyways this is my personal experience, I thought I’d share just in case someone was looking into moving there. 
Oh also the employment market is overtly saturated, keep in mind that about 22Million people live in Florida so they can easily find someone to underpay for the position you applied for and they have people lined up for it. Not me, I’d choose financial liberty and low cost of living every time.",2023-12-17 23:25:01

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating.

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

But, are there any other choices?  Are there any indoor paints, coatings, periodic treatments (spray drywall with Rain-X or other water sealer??), etc. that might improve the mold-resistance of indoor materials to tolerate humidity up to 80% without mold growing on it?

(The building was built around 2006.  Original floors are wood/tile and still look new.  So, AFAIK, the higher risk is the mold peeling the paint and/or invading the walls.)

529,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, dislike",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

530,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, dislike",Moved to Miami and here’s my Take. (Warning),"So after living and Moving out of Miami here’s my not so great take on it.
*Low Pay high cost of living/Slave State
(I felt like I worked in an all inclusive)
*Vacation vs Living here is completely different 
(I obviously expected this but it’s really really different.)
*People say the “N” word a lot like overtly
* Driving reminded me of driving in Costa Rica obviously better paved but really reckless.
* A lot of Spanish which was good because I knew a bit and learned a lot.
*Service wise people try to take advantage of you almost all the time.
*The weather is Brutal
(The constant heat, rain, floods, hurricane warnings which they make it seem like the worlds going to end and puts your nerves on edge) Did I mention flood driving… Anxiety on a new level lol
*Mosquitos run in packs and I’ve never been so bit up in my life, keep bug spray on you.
*Top 10 Cockroach infestation in the country
* People weren’t the kindest out here that’s for sure and I was treated super weird going into certain restaurants not knowing Spanish.
*Allergies
(I hardly have allergies but apparently the mold due to the high humidity and pollen was pretty intense)
This seems to be what I was told which it’s a great retirement place.
I recently moved out, went back to where I can pay 1400 for a 1 bedroom, Make more money, save money and visit Miami for a few weeks and head back home to continue saving money for my retirement. Moving there was a whirlwind and if you can make it out there good for you but nothing in the world would make me want to move back unless I hit the lotto and even then I don’t like the hurricanes and flooding so I’d still probably pass and only vacation there. You’ll loose years of your life trying to keep up with bills along with the lifestyle.
Anyways this is my personal experience, I thought I’d share just in case someone was looking into moving there. 
Oh also the employment market is overtly saturated, keep in mind that about 22Million people live in Florida so they can easily find someone to underpay for the position you applied for and they have people lined up for it.

534,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, dislike",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

going to visit Florida for the first time in September. I'm from Germany and have no other time so it has to be then. I'm a bit scared of Hurrican season but i try to stay positive.

On the last days we stay in Sarasota and Tampa and then heading back to Orlando.

  
Only things we have planned to maybe visit a Dolphins game (currently the prices are really high) and maybe a Bucs game. Maybe Disneyland too.

Dream would be also to do a snorkeling trip but I don't know how the weather will be.

Please give me some advice! I would really like to go to Florida but maybe it's better to visit some other time of year?

People do not care if they’ll run you over(they’ll get away with it) it was incredibly frustrating because I liked the workout.i like getting exercise when I can get, and the weather is getting tolerable

I’ve never been shown a greater amount of disrespect by the general public than on a bicycle. Nobody yields, nobody gives space, people will purposely vroom past you, it seriously felt like I was vilified by society like I was some murderer.

No i wasn’t one of those annoying bicyclists that ride in the middle of the road or one that has a chip on their shoulder. I’m 20 years old, riding my bike to the library or a friends house so I can go use the computer to do schoolwork because I can’t do it at home. I always rode on the sidewalk whenever possible but there’s sometimes no sidewalk. And I’ve almost been hit a couple of times. Dead before I can legally drink because I don’t have a car was a wild thought. I will never ever ride a bike on public areas again. I have a car again, and seriously it takes zero effort to let a bicycle cross the fucking street or give them some space. What is wrong with our country?

572,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, annoying",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

going to visit Florida for the first time in September. I'm from Germany and have no other time so it has to be then. I'm a bit scared of Hurrican season but i try to stay positive.

On the last days we stay in Sarasota and Tampa and then heading back to Orlando.

586,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, annoying",An Open Letter to Spring Breakers. Come to Iceland. It's Wilder.,"# An Open Letter to Every Drunk Spring Breaker in Miami

By an Iceland-ish Friend

Dear Drunk College Students,

Going to Florida for one wild and crazy week a year makes sense. It is a very pretty place, with its palm trees and beaches and elderly population. You can eat breakfast at any time of the day and sometimes alligators cross the road. 

Do you know what crosses the road in Iceland my dear drunk friends? WILD HORSES and RAINBOWS. I don’t want to be a soggy beach blanket but perhaps it’s time to consider a more exotic destination for Spring Break, somewhere you can really go wild. Iceland baby!

You want to drink until you blackout and wake up with a strange sexy person in a mysterious and sexy place? We do that all the time but we drink Brennivin while lounging nuuude in geothermal jacuzzis and later, after we make love to an attractive person who we have verified we are not related to, we sometimes wake up under the Northern Lights. Vape that, Miami. 

One time, my cousin got me so drunk I browned out, I think that’s what you call it, and I came to on top of an active volcano. And let me tell you, there’s no cure for a hangover like running for your life from red hot lava, if you get my flow, my lava flow?

Doesn’t our country sound like an enchanting place? We don’t even need drugs here because we believe in fairies and frost giants and are home to dozens of rainbows each day. But wait, there’s more! We have ice diamond beaches, geysers, glaciers, the majestic Vestrahorn Mountains, puffin colonies, waterfalls, fermented shark, more waterfalls, Björk, and Black Death drink.

Ok ok, so your friends will all be in Flooorida or something. But according to my readings, Florida is sinking! Dearest drunks, it’s sliding into the ocean. What will happen to you if you’re dancing nudey groovy and suddenly dolphins swim by? Americans are very special but I’m pretty sure you don’t have gills. This is not the Little Mermaid. Stingrays and dolphins will be happy partying in your abandoned underwater South Beach dance clubs while you search for a new submarine condo.

I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to be negative. I take that back. Let’s start over ok? No more end of times talk. 

Don’t you spend enough time with your Spring Break friends already? Aren’t you a teensy weensy bit curious to explore our fascinating Icelandic gene pool? Everyone here is good looking, friendly, and extremely strong. It’s really great! 

If we were a little genetically more diverse I wouldn’t even be writing you this letter. See dear drunks, we have a little problem. Well it’s not a problem so much as it is an annoyance. We are a small country right? Very charming, no? Well, when you’re small, you have a lot more cousins than you think - almost all of us are at least a little bit related. Some smartypants even built an app to help us avoid smooches in the family tree, thanks be to Freyja.

But what would be really super cool would be if you would bring like, a whole lot of sexy American people to Iceland for Spring Break. Maybe you’ll like it and want to stay or we can all fall in love or you know, something. 

So please forget about Miami and Cancun and that beach in Texas and come Spring Break in Iceland. 

P.S. Don’t forget your sunscreen, rain poncho, wool socks, and party pants! See you soon!

From what I have read it sounds like she bought the property in 2012 and the storm drainage system was put in in the 1980s, her argument is they didn't ask permission from her to put in the storm drains. So she single-handedly required everybody in the neighborhood to purchase flood insurance.

Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.
 
I’m curious what you all have to say.",2024-06-12 14:37:32
610,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, happy",Moved to Miami and here’s my Take. (Warning),"So after living and Moving out of Miami here’s my not so great take on it.
*Low Pay high cost of living/Slave State
(I felt like I worked in an all inclusive)
*Vacation vs Living here is completely different 
(I obviously expected this but it’s really really different.)
*People say the “N” word a lot like overtly
* Driving reminded me of driving in Costa Rica obviously better paved but really reckless.
* A lot of Spanish which was good because I knew a bit and learned a lot.
*Service wise people try to take advantage of you almost all the time.
*The weather is Brutal
(The constant heat, rain, floods, hurricane warnings which they make it seem like the worlds going to end and puts your nerves on edge) Did I mention flood driving… Anxiety on a new level lol
*Mosquitos run in packs and I’ve never been so bit up in my life, keep bug spray on you.
*Top 10 Cockroach infestation in the country
* People weren’t the kindest out here that’s for sure and I was treated super weird going into certain restaurants not knowing Spanish.
*Allergies
(I hardly have allergies but apparently the mold due to the high humidity and pollen was pretty intense)
This seems to be what I was told which it’s a great retirement place.
I recently moved out, went back to where I can pay 1400 for a 1 bedroom, Make more money, save money and visit Miami for a few weeks and head back home to continue saving money for my retirement. Moving there was a whirlwind and if you can make it out there good for you but nothing in the world would make me want to move back unless I hit the lotto and even then I don’t like the hurricanes and flooding so I’d still probably pass and only vacation there. You’ll loose years of your life trying to keep up with bills along with the lifestyle.
Anyways this is my personal experience, I thought I’d share just in case someone was looking into moving there. 
Oh also the employment market is overtly saturated, keep in mind that about 22Million people live in Florida so they can easily find someone to underpay for the position you applied for and they have people lined up for it. Not me, I’d choose financial liberty and low cost of living every time.",2023-12-17 23:25:01

I live here and personally I don't like it. I hate the southern conservative lifestyle. I've always been a city guy and Pensacola isn't considered a city at least in my opinion it's a town. I also really hate the southern accent, can't really put my finger on why I just don't like it. There's really just nothing to do here. I'm currently in a bigger city rn and I'll be returning to Pensacola in a month which I'm dreading. I'm more happy in bigger cities. But yeah that's about it what do you guys think?

616,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, happy",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

going to visit Florida for the first time in September. I'm from Germany and have no other time so it has to be then. I'm a bit scared of Hurrican season but i try to stay positive. 

Flying to Orlando then going to Miami on the next day. Staying there a couple of days and then going to Marathon (Key West) for 3 days. After that we either do a stop in the Everglades (in a nearby hotel) and then we heading to naples.

On the last days we stay in Sarasota and Tampa and then heading back to Orlando.

  
Only things we have planned to maybe visit a Dolphins game (currently the prices are really high) and maybe a Bucs game. Maybe Disneyland too.

Dream would be also to do a snorkeling trip but I don't know how the weather will be.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03
625,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US – all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07

630,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‘Dial *FHP for emergency’.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‘soon’.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it’s not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can’t see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‘escorting’ a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‘wide load’ sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm…) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while…. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, “Now that you’ve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?”  The response: “Sir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.” I’ll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy’s awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don’t need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‘fund raiser mode’, but the time I actually need one?

By an Iceland-ish Friend

Dear Drunk College Students,

Going to Florida for one wild and crazy week a year makes sense. It is a very pretty place, with its palm trees and beaches and elderly population. You can eat breakfast at any time of the day and sometimes alligators cross the road. 

Do you know what crosses the road in Iceland my dear drunk friends? WILD HORSES and RAINBOWS. I don’t want to be a soggy beach blanket but perhaps it’s time to consider a more exotic destination for Spring Break, somewhere you can really go wild. Iceland baby!

You want to drink until you blackout and wake up with a strange sexy person in a mysterious and sexy place? We do that all the time but we drink Brennivin while lounging nuuude in geothermal jacuzzis and later, after we make love to an attractive person who we have verified we are not related to, we sometimes wake up under the Northern Lights. Vape that, Miami. 

One time, my cousin got me so drunk I browned out, I think that’s what you call it, and I came to on top of an active volcano. And let me tell you, there’s no cure for a hangover like running for your life from red hot lava, if you get my flow, my lava flow?

Doesn’t our country sound like an enchanting place? We don’t even need drugs here because we believe in fairies and frost giants and are home to dozens of rainbows each day. But wait, there’s more! We have ice diamond beaches, geysers, glaciers, the majestic Vestrahorn Mountains, puffin colonies, waterfalls, fermented shark, more waterfalls, Björk, and Black Death drink.

Ok ok, so your friends will all be in Flooorida or something. But according to my readings, Florida is sinking! Dearest drunks, it’s sliding into the ocean. What will happen to you if you’re dancing nudey groovy and suddenly dolphins swim by? Americans are very special but I’m pretty sure you don’t have gills. This is not the Little Mermaid. Stingrays and dolphins will be happy partying in your abandoned underwater South Beach dance clubs while you search for a new submarine condo.

I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to be negative. I take that back. Let’s start over ok? No more end of times talk. 

Don’t you spend enough time with your Spring Break friends already? Aren’t you a teensy weensy bit curious to explore our fascinating Icelandic gene pool? Everyone here is good looking, friendly, and extremely strong. It’s really great! 

If we were a little genetically more diverse I wouldn’t even be writing you this letter. See dear drunks, we have a little problem. Well it’s not a problem so much as it is an annoyance. We are a small country right? Very charming, no? Well, when you’re small, you have a lot more cousins than you think - almost all of us are at least a little bit related. Some smartypants even built an app to help us avoid smooches in the family tree, thanks be to Freyja.

But what would be really super cool would be if you would bring like, a whole lot of sexy American people to Iceland for Spring Break. Maybe you’ll like it and want to stay or we can all fall in love or you know, something. 

So please forget about Miami and Cancun and that beach in Texas and come Spring Break in Iceland. 

P.S. Don’t forget your sunscreen, rain poncho, wool socks, and party pants! See you soon!

This year, we would like a similar experience but hopefully go a month earlier w even warmer weather. I'm looking for recommendations on similar places to go. I'd love to go to Clearwater again however the girls would like to try a new city.

Requirements are: White powdery beaches. Great food and shopping options all in walking distance. I will have a rental car regardless.

I've researched Destin, Miramar beach, Treasure Island and St Pete. However I'm undecided and I'm sure they are 100s more places we could go.

Here's a link to one of the news articles. Basically the Community has storm drains that the easement runs next to this woman's property and it needed repairs from the sounds of it. From what I have read it sounds like she bought the property in 2012 and the storm drainage system was put in in the 1980s, her argument is they didn't ask permission from her to put in the storm drains. So she single-handedly required everybody in the neighborhood to purchase flood insurance.

I'm just posting this because I'm astonished that someone can get away with damaging public infrastructure and it's a civil matter rather than criminal even though many homeowners have been harmed because of her actions.

Lots of rain, but zero lightning. At least not where I’ve been. Today we drove Sarasota to Tampa- rain clouds were everywhere- but like I mentioned- dispersed. And zero lightning.

654,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, annoyed",Moved to Miami and here’s my Take. (Warning),"So after living and Moving out of Miami here’s my not so great take on it.
*Low Pay high cost of living/Slave State
(I felt like I worked in an all inclusive)
*Vacation vs Living here is completely different 
(I obviously expected this but it’s really really different.)
*People say the “N” word a lot like overtly
* Driving reminded me of driving in Costa Rica obviously better paved but really reckless.
* A lot of Spanish which was good because I knew a bit and learned a lot.
*Service wise people try to take advantage of you almost all the time.
*The weather is Brutal
(The constant heat, rain, floods, hurricane warnings which they make it seem like the worlds going to end and puts your nerves on edge) Did I mention flood driving… Anxiety on a new level lol
*Mosquitos run in packs and I’ve never been so bit up in my life, keep bug spray on you.
*Top 10 Cockroach infestation in the country
* People weren’t the kindest out here that’s for sure and I was treated super weird going into certain restaurants not knowing Spanish.
*Allergies
(I hardly have allergies but apparently the mold due to the high humidity and pollen was pretty intense)
This seems to be what I was told which it’s a great retirement place.
I recently moved out, went back to where I can pay 1400 for a 1 bedroom, Make more money, save money and visit Miami for a few weeks and head back home to continue saving money for my retirement. Moving there was a whirlwind and if you can make it out there good for you but nothing in the world would make me want to move back unless I hit the lotto and even then I don’t like the hurricanes and flooding so I’d still probably pass and only vacation there. You’ll loose years of your life trying to keep up with bills along with the lifestyle.
Anyways this is my personal experience, I thought I’d share just in case someone was looking into moving there. 
Oh also the employment market is overtly saturated, keep in mind that about 22Million people live in Florida so they can easily find someone to underpay for the position you applied for and they have people lined up for it. Not me, I’d choose financial liberty and low cost of living every time.",2023-12-17 23:25:01

I’ve never been shown a greater amount of disrespect by the general public than on a bicycle. Nobody yields, nobody gives space, people will purposely vroom past you, it seriously felt like I was vilified by society like I was some murderer.

No i wasn’t one of those annoying bicyclists that ride in the middle of the road or one that has a chip on their shoulder. I’m 20 years old, riding my bike to the library or a friends house so I can go use the computer to do schoolwork because I can’t do it at home. I always rode on the sidewalk whenever possible but there’s sometimes no sidewalk. And I’ve almost been hit a couple of times. Dead before I can legally drink because I don’t have a car was a wild thought. I will never ever ride a bike on public areas again.

660,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, annoyed",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

673,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, annoyed",An Open Letter to Spring Breakers. Come to Iceland. It's Wilder.,"# An Open Letter to Every Drunk Spring Breaker in Miami

By an Iceland-ish Friend

Dear Drunk College Students,

Going to Florida for one wild and crazy week a year makes sense. It is a very pretty place, with its palm trees and beaches and elderly population. You can eat breakfast at any time of the day and sometimes alligators cross the road. 

Do you know what crosses the road in Iceland my dear drunk friends? WILD HORSES and RAINBOWS. I don’t want to be a soggy beach blanket but perhaps it’s time to consider a more exotic destination for Spring Break, somewhere you can really go wild. Iceland baby!

You want to drink until you blackout and wake up with a strange sexy person in a mysterious and sexy place? We do that all the time but we drink Brennivin while lounging nuuude in geothermal jacuzzis and later, after we make love to an attractive person who we have verified we are not related to, we sometimes wake up under the Northern Lights. Vape that, Miami. 

One time, my cousin got me so drunk I browned out, I think that’s what you call it, and I came to on top of an active volcano. And let me tell you, there’s no cure for a hangover like running for your life from red hot lava, if you get my flow, my lava flow?

Doesn’t our country sound like an enchanting place? We don’t even need drugs here because we believe in fairies and frost giants and are home to dozens of rainbows each day. But wait, there’s more! We have ice diamond beaches, geysers, glaciers, the majestic Vestrahorn Mountains, puffin colonies, waterfalls, fermented shark, more waterfalls, Björk, and Black Death drink.

Ok ok, so your friends will all be in Flooorida or something. But according to my readings, Florida is sinking! Dearest drunks, it’s sliding into the ocean. What will happen to you if you’re dancing nudey groovy and suddenly dolphins swim by? Americans are very special but I’m pretty sure you don’t have gills. This is not the Little Mermaid. Stingrays and dolphins will be happy partying in your abandoned underwater South Beach dance clubs while you search for a new submarine condo.

I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to be negative. I take that back. Let’s start over ok? No more end of times talk. 

Don’t you spend enough time with your Spring Break friends already? Aren’t you a teensy weensy bit curious to explore our fascinating Icelandic gene pool? Everyone here is good looking, friendly, and extremely strong. It’s really great! 

If we were a little genetically more diverse I wouldn’t even be writing you this letter. See dear drunks, we have a little problem. Well it’s not a problem so much as it is an annoyance. We are a small country right? Very charming, no? Well, when you’re small, you have a lot more cousins than you think - almost all of us are at least a little bit related. Some smartypants even built an app to help us avoid smooches in the family tree, thanks be to Freyja.

But what would be really super cool would be if you would bring like, a whole lot of sexy American people to Iceland for Spring Break. Maybe you’ll like it and want to stay or we can all fall in love or you know, something. 

So please forget about Miami and Cancun and that beach in Texas and come Spring Break in Iceland.

This year, we would like a similar experience but hopefully go a month earlier w even warmer weather. I'm looking for recommendations on similar places to go. I'd love to go to Clearwater again however the girls would like to try a new city.

Here's a link to one of the news articles. Basically the Community has storm drains that the easement runs next to this woman's property and it needed repairs from the sounds of it. From what I have read it sounds like she bought the property in 2012 and the storm drainage system was put in in the 1980s, her argument is they didn't ask permission from her to put in the storm drains. So she single-handedly required everybody in the neighborhood to purchase flood insurance.

I'm just posting this because I'm astonished that someone can get away with damaging public infrastructure and it's a civil matter rather than criminal even though many homeowners have been harmed because of her actions.

694,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, comfortable",Moved to Miami and here’s my Take. (Warning),"So after living and Moving out of Miami here’s my not so great take on it.
*Low Pay high cost of living/Slave State
(I felt like I worked in an all inclusive)
*Vacation vs Living here is completely different 
(I obviously expected this but it’s really really different.)
*People say the “N” word a lot like overtly
* Driving reminded me of driving in Costa Rica obviously better paved but really reckless.
* A lot of Spanish which was good because I knew a bit and learned a lot.
*Service wise people try to take advantage of you almost all the time.
*The weather is Brutal
(The constant heat, rain, floods, hurricane warnings which they make it seem like the worlds going to end and puts your nerves on edge) Did I mention flood driving… Anxiety on a new level lol
*Mosquitos run in packs and I’ve never been so bit up in my life, keep bug spray on you.
*Top 10 Cockroach infestation in the country
* People weren’t the kindest out here that’s for sure and I was treated super weird going into certain restaurants not knowing Spanish.
*Allergies
(I hardly have allergies but apparently the mold due to the high humidity and pollen was pretty intense)
This seems to be what I was told which it’s a great retirement place.
I recently moved out, went back to where I can pay 1400 for a 1 bedroom, Make more money, save money and visit Miami for a few weeks and head back home to continue saving money for my retirement. Moving there was a whirlwind and if you can make it out there good for you but nothing in the world would make me want to move back unless I hit the lotto and even then I don’t like the hurricanes and flooding so I’d still probably pass and only vacation there. You’ll loose years of your life trying to keep up with bills along with the lifestyle.
Anyways this is my personal experience, I thought I’d share just in case someone was looking into moving there. 
Oh also the employment market is overtly saturated, keep in mind that about 22Million people live in Florida so they can easily find someone to underpay for the position you applied for and they have people lined up for it. Not me, I’d choose financial liberty and low cost of living every time.",2023-12-17 23:25:01

698,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, comfortable",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

going to visit Florida for the first time in September. I'm from Germany and have no other time so it has to be then. I'm a bit scared of Hurrican season but i try to stay positive.

On the last days we stay in Sarasota and Tampa and then heading back to Orlando.

727,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, love",Quick Update on the Biden-Harris Administration’s Response to Hurricane Milton.,"President Biden has directed his Administration to do everything possible to prepare for Hurricane Milton:

* President Biden granted emergency declarations to the State of Florida and the Seminole Tribe of Florida to help cover costs for life-safety and life-sustaining actions ahead of the storm
* FEMA surged search and rescue teams, water, food, power generators, and ambulances to the region
* FEMA is prepared to coordinate a full-fledged federal response
* Administrator Deanne Criswell will be in Florida to oversee the response

Evacuation orders are in effect in multiple counties. If you are in evacuation zones and have not left the area yet, you should do so immediately for your safety. Emergency shelters are open and transportation assistance is available. If you can’t evacuate, or need a safe place to go, text SHELTER & your zip code to 4-3-3-6-2 to get a list of open shelters near you.

We will be there with you as you weather this new storm.

**Update 1 – October 10, 2024**

* President Biden and Vice President Harris have been in constant contact with State and local officials
* President Biden has directed:
   * Defense Secretary Austin to provide a range of military capabilities to Florida
   * FEMA to open disaster recovery centers across the impacted communities right away
   * Federal agencies to mobilize resources, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s mortgage relief for impacted homeowners
* The U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are assessing how fast they can reopen the Port of Tampa to get fuel, food, water, and other basic goods flowing into the area again
* The Federal Aviation Administration has authorized Florida Power and Light to fly large drones to quickly assess damage so ground crews can restore power more quickly
* More than 50,000 powerline workers have come from around the U.S. and Canada to restore power
* FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell has been on the ground since last night and will continue to work with State and local partners to determine any unmet needs
* More than 1,000 federal personnel are on the ground

We know from previous hurricanes that it’s often the case that more lives are lost in the days following the storm than the actual storm itself. We strongly encourage everyone impacted by this storm to stay inside and off the roads – as downed power lines, debris, and road washouts are creating dangerous conditions. Please continue to shelter in place until local leaders give an all-clear.

We will continue to do everything in our power to help you recover and rebuild.

**Update 2 – October 11, 2024**

* More than 2,600 federal personnel remain on the ground
* Search and Rescue teams have supported more than 4,200 rescues and assists
* 50,000 workers are restoring power. Milton left over 3 million people without power – because of the dedication of these workers, more than 1 million people have had their power restored so far
* 1.2 million meals have been delivered, with another 1.6 million slated to be delivered today
* FEMA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Florida National Guard are on the ground helping the State clear debris to reopen roads for critical deliveries of food, water, tarps, and lifesaving supplies
* The U.S. Coast Guard continues to lead the effort to assess how fast we can reopen the Port of Tampa for essential deliveries of goods and fuel

Our Administration continues to reiterate that conspiracy theories and misinformation are harmful to those who most need the help. We will continue to provide all the resources necessary to rescue, recover, and rebuild.",2024-10-09 16:10:30

Here's a link to one of the news articles. Basically the Community has storm drains that the easement runs next to this woman's property and it needed repairs from the sounds of it. From what I have read it sounds like she bought the property in 2012 and the storm drainage system was put in in the 1980s, her argument is they didn't ask permission from her to put in the storm drains. So she single-handedly required everybody in the neighborhood to purchase flood insurance.

I'm just posting this because I'm astonished that someone can get away with damaging public infrastructure and it's a civil matter rather than criminal even though many homeowners have been harmed because of her actions.

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing.

# FAQ

>**Should I leave?**

Run from water, hide from wind. Typically you only need to move tens of miles inland, not hundreds of miles. If you are on an island, not connected to the mainland, causeways will close *after* the storm.

If you are in an Evacuation Zone *you will not be forced to leave.* However Emergency Services will not be running during and possibly well after the storm as passed. If you have an emergency you are on your own until it is safe for Emergency Service to operate. They will not risk their life for yours.

Ultimately it is up to you to leave or not.

&#x200B;

>**What should I prepare?**

[See Disaster Supply Kit](https://www.floridadisaster.org/planprepare/hurricane-supply-checklist/). Please remember pets are family too! Include them in your planning. If you leave, please take them with you.

Bring in anything outside that isn't nailed down. Do not throw patio furniture in the pool - can can both damaged your pool and the furniture (rust).

If you do any tree trimming in the days leading up to the storm ***DO NOT*** leave it on the curb, bring it into your garage. All you will do is make an easy flying projectile to your house and neighbor's houses.

&#x200B;

>**How long should I expect to be without power?**

The best place to ask is your neighbors. If they've been around for a few storms they generally have a good gauge on how long they are usually without power after a storm.

FPL & Duke work on getting power back to the most people the fastest. So if you are on a grid with fewer people you may be waiting the longest.

&#x200B;

>**Should I cancel my flight? Will my flight be delayed/cancelled?**

Check the ""Arrival Time of Tropical Force Winds"" if your flight is landing/leaving near that time, expect cancellations.

But I find it entertaining whenever I visit. I live in CT where it’s great and safe but so uneventful it gets boring/depressing, especially since it’s cold from Oct-April.

756,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, love",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

767,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, love",Has anybody here actually left Florida? Where did you end up moving and did you like it?,"Not sure what other subreddit to post this one, so if you know a better subreddit, let me know.

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

But I have this fear, it always seems like everybody is talking about leaving Florida, but they never seem to actually do it.  Furthermore, people who do, it often seems like they end up back in short time.  One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.  

So what I am asking here, is there any success stories from former Floridians who moved away and loved it? Or just anybody who can share some experiences? I deeply fear falling into the ""grass is greener"" trap, but then finding out the grass is yellow everywhere.  But I do feel like in my heart of hearts deep down I should relocate before my mental sanity flies off the handle in extremely crowded and busy area I live.",2023-04-30 17:30:36

770,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, love",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

* President Biden granted emergency declarations to the State of Florida and the Seminole Tribe of Florida to help cover costs for life-safety and life-sustaining actions ahead of the storm
* FEMA surged search and rescue teams, water, food, power generators, and ambulances to the region
* FEMA is prepared to coordinate a full-fledged federal response
* Administrator Deanne Criswell will be in Florida to oversee the response

Evacuation orders are in effect in multiple counties. If you are in evacuation zones and have not left the area yet, you should do so immediately for your safety. Emergency shelters are open and transportation assistance is available. If you can’t evacuate, or need a safe place to go, text SHELTER & your zip code to 4-3-3-6-2 to get a list of open shelters near you.

We will be there with you as you weather this new storm.

**Update 1 – October 10, 2024**

* President Biden and Vice President Harris have been in constant contact with State and local officials
* President Biden has directed:
   * Defense Secretary Austin to provide a range of military capabilities to Florida
   * FEMA to open disaster recovery centers across the impacted communities right away
   * Federal agencies to mobilize resources, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s mortgage relief for impacted homeowners
* The U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are assessing how fast they can reopen the Port of Tampa to get fuel, food, water, and other basic goods flowing into the area again
* The Federal Aviation Administration has authorized Florida Power and Light to fly large drones to quickly assess damage so ground crews can restore power more quickly
* More than 50,000 powerline workers have come from around the U.S. and Canada to restore power
* FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell has been on the ground since last night and will continue to work with State and local partners to determine any unmet needs
* More than 1,000 federal personnel are on the ground

We know from previous hurricanes that it’s often the case that more lives are lost in the days following the storm than the actual storm itself. We strongly encourage everyone impacted by this storm to stay inside and off the roads – as downed power lines, debris, and road washouts are creating dangerous conditions. Please continue to shelter in place until local leaders give an all-clear.

We will continue to do everything in our power to help you recover and rebuild.

**Update 2 – October 11, 2024**

* More than 2,600 federal personnel remain on the ground
* Search and Rescue teams have supported more than 4,200 rescues and assists
* 50,000 workers are restoring power. Milton left over 3 million people without power – because of the dedication of these workers, more than 1 million people have had their power restored so far
* 1.2 million meals have been delivered, with another 1.6 million slated to be delivered today
* FEMA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Florida National Guard are on the ground helping the State clear debris to reopen roads for critical deliveries of food, water, tarps, and lifesaving supplies
* The U.S. Coast Guard continues to lead the effort to assess how fast we can reopen the Port of Tampa for essential deliveries of goods and fuel

Our Administration continues to reiterate that conspiracy theories and misinformation are harmful to those who most need the help. We will continue to provide all the resources necessary to rescue, recover, and rebuild.",2024-10-09 16:10:30

Here's a link to one of the news articles. Basically the Community has storm drains that the easement runs next to this woman's property and it needed repairs from the sounds of it. From what I have read it sounds like she bought the property in 2012 and the storm drainage system was put in in the 1980s, her argument is they didn't ask permission from her to put in the storm drains. So she single-handedly required everybody in the neighborhood to purchase flood insurance.

# FAQ

>**Should I leave?**

Run from water, hide from wind. Typically you only need to move tens of miles inland, not hundreds of miles. If you are on an island, not connected to the mainland, causeways will close *after* the storm.

If you are in an Evacuation Zone *you will not be forced to leave.* However Emergency Services will not be running during and possibly well after the storm as passed. If you have an emergency you are on your own until it is safe for Emergency Service to operate. They will not risk their life for yours.

Ultimately it is up to you to leave or not.

&#x200B;

>**What should I prepare?**

[See Disaster Supply Kit](https://www.floridadisaster.org/planprepare/hurricane-supply-checklist/). Please remember pets are family too! Include them in your planning. If you leave, please take them with you.

Bring in anything outside that isn't nailed down. Do not throw patio furniture in the pool - can can both damaged your pool and the furniture (rust).

If you do any tree trimming in the days leading up to the storm ***DO NOT*** leave it on the curb, bring it into your garage. All you will do is make an easy flying projectile to your house and neighbor's houses.

&#x200B;

>**How long should I expect to be without power?**

The best place to ask is your neighbors. If they've been around for a few storms they generally have a good gauge on how long they are usually without power after a storm.

FPL & Duke work on getting power back to the most people the fastest. So if you are on a grid with fewer people you may be waiting the longest.

&#x200B;

>**Should I cancel my flight? Will my flight be delayed/cancelled?**

Check the ""Arrival Time of Tropical Force Winds"" if your flight is landing/leaving near that time, expect cancellations.

799,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, hate",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

804,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, hate","Higher insurance rates, or at the least higher costs of home ownership/living here, are here to stay no matter what we do to fix it.","Hi, licensed insurance agent here. Yes you hate me, yes I'm sorry.

So yeah, the purpose of insurance is to transfer risk of loss to then pool said risk into larger groups. This risk is calculated, then priced for, by combining the size of the loss with the probability of it happening. This may seem weirdly academic, but it is important to understand this. Insurance companies charge premiums both to make a profit and to pool funds to eventually compensate homeowners. Whether private/public or with a profit motive or without, this is how insurance works. You pay money to transfer your risk of loss to another entity that if that loss occurred can absorb said loss.

Unfortunately, Climate change is eventually going to mean that no sane business will have any desire to accept this transference of risk without a massive increase in premiums. Our poor stewardship of the earth over the last century means that the risk of loss we face as Florida homeowners has and will continue to increase. As both the size of the loss (huge mcmansions around every corner) and probability of the loss due to climate change continues to increase, premium increases are inevitable. No insurance entity is stupid, they pay people a lot of money to calculate the increased risks of bigger and more frequent storms. The premium increases reflect a reality of the world, not (just) corporate greed (but lets be real where there is corps there is greed, but this doesn't change the economic realities that underlay the practice of offering insurance).

Socializing the risk through public insurance does nothing to actually decrease the risk, which will still need to be paid for, just publicly and collectively. If you cut all the profits out of the system, we're not going to see the same rates we saw 20 or even 10 years ago, even accounting for inflation. A more robust public option (which I favor) can't fix this, and will naturally result in higher taxes in some form, be it sales taxes, property taxes or a dreaded state income tax. The risk has gone up. Everyone can see that, this is going to cost more no matter how we structure it.

Good stewardship from governmental entities (lol lmao even) could ease the pain and make this a more orderly transition (into oblivion....), but beyond that there is no putting the genie back in the bottle. The storm gods are angrier then ever, coming for our homes and if we want to made whole for those losses, it's gonna cost all us a lot more money to do.

So yeah, maybe it is time to pack up, sell the home and move out. Personally, I'll be renting for the rest of my life in Florida. If the rents get too high due to bleed through costs, well I can cut and run for greener pastures a lot easier. I'll still lose money, but at least I won't have to try and convince some poor schmuck to take the ticking time bomb that is Florida homeownership out of my hands. There is no fixing this. This problem is bigger than just our state.

We're stuck in a vortex of corp greed, bad governance and economic realities that won't change even if we fix the first two. This ships going down or at least costing a lot more to fix. Brush up on your ""Nearer, My God, to Thee"", because the good times are gone, the okay times are here and you don't even wanna know about the bad times.

TLDR: Get out while you can or at least don't buy in, either way we're all fucked.",2023-08-30 17:40:43

Nice to see some justice in our country again and helping me look at the better side of things.  I've been so focused on my disgust of DeSantis and the policy makers here, the school board in Sarasota where my children go to school and so on that I've stopped taking time to appreciate some of the special things about Florida that I love.  So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

freaking love it out there",2023-07-19 15:00:23

Im finishing 3 months this year in Silicon Valley for another internship.

I have to know, what is with all the hatred on this sub? Some of the common points I see when people are hating on Fl are 1) cost of living, 2) weather, 3) insurance companies leaving.

.....do you people realize all these things are like 10x worse in California?

cost of living, forget about it, insurance, forget about it, weather? how many years have these wildfires been happening?

For christs sake, you people have NO INCOME TAX!!!! Only a handful of states in the US have this privilege, and florida is the only one with good beaches. No income tax, wonderful destinations, plenty of jobs, yall have alot to be grateful for.  Id KILL for no income tax, thats literally a gift from god. Most people have to fight tooth and nail to evade taxes, but your government just hands it to you on a silver platter. Ive lived in florida, and ive lived in the sapphire blue toilet bowl on the other side of the country, trust me, Id take FL any day.

Im not trying to paint this as a left or right thing, I identify as socially left and economically right, so I am  not taking a side here. but seriously yall need to appreciate what you have that us in other states (CA, NC,SC) dont have at all.

I understand some of yall dont like desantis and dont like his social policy, fair enough (although that new alimony law should have won some of you socially left people over, alimony is a patriarchal construct in the first place)

but come on, what NON-SOCIAL (I repeat, NON-SOCIAL) policies do you have or not have in florida that you think california does better? as someone whos lived in both, Im genuinely curious

Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03

* President Biden granted emergency declarations to the State of Florida and the Seminole Tribe of Florida to help cover costs for life-safety and life-sustaining actions ahead of the storm
* FEMA surged search and rescue teams, water, food, power generators, and ambulances to the region
* FEMA is prepared to coordinate a full-fledged federal response
* Administrator Deanne Criswell will be in Florida to oversee the response

Evacuation orders are in effect in multiple counties. If you are in evacuation zones and have not left the area yet, you should do so immediately for your safety. Emergency shelters are open and transportation assistance is available. If you can’t evacuate, or need a safe place to go, text SHELTER & your zip code to 4-3-3-6-2 to get a list of open shelters near you.

We will be there with you as you weather this new storm.

**Update 1 – October 10, 2024**

* President Biden and Vice President Harris have been in constant contact with State and local officials
* President Biden has directed:
   * Defense Secretary Austin to provide a range of military capabilities to Florida
   * FEMA to open disaster recovery centers across the impacted communities right away
   * Federal agencies to mobilize resources, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s mortgage relief for impacted homeowners
* The U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are assessing how fast they can reopen the Port of Tampa to get fuel, food, water, and other basic goods flowing into the area again
* The Federal Aviation Administration has authorized Florida Power and Light to fly large drones to quickly assess damage so ground crews can restore power more quickly
* More than 50,000 powerline workers have come from around the U.S. and Canada to restore power
* FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell has been on the ground since last night and will continue to work with State and local partners to determine any unmet needs
* More than 1,000 federal personnel are on the ground

We know from previous hurricanes that it’s often the case that more lives are lost in the days following the storm than the actual storm itself. We strongly encourage everyone impacted by this storm to stay inside and off the roads – as downed power lines, debris, and road washouts are creating dangerous conditions. Please continue to shelter in place until local leaders give an all-clear.

We will continue to do everything in our power to help you recover and rebuild.

**Update 2 – October 11, 2024**

* More than 2,600 federal personnel remain on the ground
* Search and Rescue teams have supported more than 4,200 rescues and assists
* 50,000 workers are restoring power. Milton left over 3 million people without power – because of the dedication of these workers, more than 1 million people have had their power restored so far
* 1.2 million meals have been delivered, with another 1.6 million slated to be delivered today
* FEMA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Florida National Guard are on the ground helping the State clear debris to reopen roads for critical deliveries of food, water, tarps, and lifesaving supplies
* The U.S. Coast Guard continues to lead the effort to assess how fast we can reopen the Port of Tampa for essential deliveries of goods and fuel

Our Administration continues to reiterate that conspiracy theories and misinformation are harmful to those who most need the help. We will continue to provide all the resources necessary to rescue, recover, and rebuild.",2024-10-09 16:10:30

845,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, enjoy",What has happened to Florida?,"I grew up in FL and moved away when I was 20. While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous. 

What happened to Florida? Its literally become the playground for the far right. I dont even associate it with Publix, alligators, oranges, beaches, dolphins and Jimmy Buffett music anymore.",2023-07-03 14:00:21

Here's a link to one of the news articles. Basically the Community has storm drains that the easement runs next to this woman's property and it needed repairs from the sounds of it. From what I have read it sounds like she bought the property in 2012 and the storm drainage system was put in in the 1980s, her argument is they didn't ask permission from her to put in the storm drains. So she single-handedly required everybody in the neighborhood to purchase flood insurance.

I'm just posting this because I'm astonished that someone can get away with damaging public infrastructure and it's a civil matter rather than criminal even though many homeowners have been harmed because of her actions.

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing.

# FAQ

>**Should I leave?**

Run from water, hide from wind. Typically you only need to move tens of miles inland, not hundreds of miles. If you are on an island, not connected to the mainland, causeways will close *after* the storm.

If you are in an Evacuation Zone *you will not be forced to leave.* However Emergency Services will not be running during and possibly well after the storm as passed. If you have an emergency you are on your own until it is safe for Emergency Service to operate. They will not risk their life for yours.

Ultimately it is up to you to leave or not.

&#x200B;

>**What should I prepare?**

[See Disaster Supply Kit](https://www.floridadisaster.org/planprepare/hurricane-supply-checklist/). Please remember pets are family too! Include them in your planning. If you leave, please take them with you.

Bring in anything outside that isn't nailed down. Do not throw patio furniture in the pool - can can both damaged your pool and the furniture (rust).

If you do any tree trimming in the days leading up to the storm ***DO NOT*** leave it on the curb, bring it into your garage. All you will do is make an easy flying projectile to your house and neighbor's houses.

&#x200B;

>**How long should I expect to be without power?**

The best place to ask is your neighbors. If they've been around for a few storms they generally have a good gauge on how long they are usually without power after a storm.

FPL & Duke work on getting power back to the most people the fastest. So if you are on a grid with fewer people you may be waiting the longest.

&#x200B;

>**Should I cancel my flight? Will my flight be delayed/cancelled?**

Check the ""Arrival Time of Tropical Force Winds"" if your flight is landing/leaving near that time, expect cancellations.

861,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, enjoy",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.
 
I’m curious what you all have to say.",2024-06-12 14:37:32

872,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, enjoy",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating. I'd be giving up everything I love, even down to the food, weather, and geography.

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

* President Biden granted emergency declarations to the State of Florida and the Seminole Tribe of Florida to help cover costs for life-safety and life-sustaining actions ahead of the storm
* FEMA surged search and rescue teams, water, food, power generators, and ambulances to the region
* FEMA is prepared to coordinate a full-fledged federal response
* Administrator Deanne Criswell will be in Florida to oversee the response

Evacuation orders are in effect in multiple counties. If you are in evacuation zones and have not left the area yet, you should do so immediately for your safety. Emergency shelters are open and transportation assistance is available. If you can’t evacuate, or need a safe place to go, text SHELTER & your zip code to 4-3-3-6-2 to get a list of open shelters near you.

We will be there with you as you weather this new storm.

**Update 1 – October 10, 2024**

* President Biden and Vice President Harris have been in constant contact with State and local officials
* President Biden has directed:
   * Defense Secretary Austin to provide a range of military capabilities to Florida
   * FEMA to open disaster recovery centers across the impacted communities right away
   * Federal agencies to mobilize resources, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s mortgage relief for impacted homeowners
* The U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are assessing how fast they can reopen the Port of Tampa to get fuel, food, water, and other basic goods flowing into the area again
* The Federal Aviation Administration has authorized Florida Power and Light to fly large drones to quickly assess damage so ground crews can restore power more quickly
* More than 50,000 powerline workers have come from around the U.S. and Canada to restore power
* FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell has been on the ground since last night and will continue to work with State and local partners to determine any unmet needs
* More than 1,000 federal personnel are on the ground

We know from previous hurricanes that it’s often the case that more lives are lost in the days following the storm than the actual storm itself. We strongly encourage everyone impacted by this storm to stay inside and off the roads – as downed power lines, debris, and road washouts are creating dangerous conditions. Please continue to shelter in place until local leaders give an all-clear.

We will continue to do everything in our power to help you recover and rebuild.

**Update 2 – October 11, 2024**

* More than 2,600 federal personnel remain on the ground
* Search and Rescue teams have supported more than 4,200 rescues and assists
* 50,000 workers are restoring power. Milton left over 3 million people without power – because of the dedication of these workers, more than 1 million people have had their power restored so far
* 1.2 million meals have been delivered, with another 1.6 million slated to be delivered today
* FEMA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Florida National Guard are on the ground helping the State clear debris to reopen roads for critical deliveries of food, water, tarps, and lifesaving supplies
* The U.S. Coast Guard continues to lead the effort to assess how fast we can reopen the Port of Tampa for essential deliveries of goods and fuel

Run from water, hide from wind. Typically you only need to move tens of miles inland, not hundreds of miles. If you are on an island, not connected to the mainland, causeways will close *after* the storm.

If you are in an Evacuation Zone *you will not be forced to leave.* However Emergency Services will not be running during and possibly well after the storm as passed. If you have an emergency you are on your own until it is safe for Emergency Service to operate. They will not risk their life for yours.

Ultimately it is up to you to leave or not.

&#x200B;

>**What should I prepare?**

[See Disaster Supply Kit](https://www.floridadisaster.org/planprepare/hurricane-supply-checklist/). Please remember pets are family too! Include them in your planning. If you leave, please take them with you.

Bring in anything outside that isn't nailed down. Do not throw patio furniture in the pool - can can both damaged your pool and the furniture (rust).

If you do any tree trimming in the days leading up to the storm ***DO NOT*** leave it on the curb, bring it into your garage. All you will do is make an easy flying projectile to your house and neighbor's houses.

&#x200B;

>**How long should I expect to be without power?**

The best place to ask is your neighbors. If they've been around for a few storms they generally have a good gauge on how long they are usually without power after a storm.

FPL & Duke work on getting power back to the most people the fastest. So if you are on a grid with fewer people you may be waiting the longest.

&#x200B;

>**Should I cancel my flight? Will my flight be delayed/cancelled?**

Check the ""Arrival Time of Tropical Force Winds"" if your flight is landing/leaving near that time, expect cancellations.

921,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, dislike",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.
 
I’m curious what you all have to say.",2024-06-12 14:37:32

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‘soon’.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it’s not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can’t see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‘escorting’ a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‘wide load’ sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm…) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while…. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, “Now that you’ve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?”  The response: “Sir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.” I’ll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy’s awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don’t need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‘fund raiser mode’, but the time I actually need one?

BTW- the inside of a lighting bolt is bright yellow.",2023-08-06 19:47:46

962,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, annoying",Quick Update on the Biden-Harris Administration’s Response to Hurricane Milton.,"President Biden has directed his Administration to do everything possible to prepare for Hurricane Milton:

* President Biden granted emergency declarations to the State of Florida and the Seminole Tribe of Florida to help cover costs for life-safety and life-sustaining actions ahead of the storm
* FEMA surged search and rescue teams, water, food, power generators, and ambulances to the region
* FEMA is prepared to coordinate a full-fledged federal response
* Administrator Deanne Criswell will be in Florida to oversee the response

Evacuation orders are in effect in multiple counties. If you are in evacuation zones and have not left the area yet, you should do so immediately for your safety. Emergency shelters are open and transportation assistance is available. If you can’t evacuate, or need a safe place to go, text SHELTER & your zip code to 4-3-3-6-2 to get a list of open shelters near you.

We will be there with you as you weather this new storm.

**Update 1 – October 10, 2024**

* President Biden and Vice President Harris have been in constant contact with State and local officials
* President Biden has directed:
   * Defense Secretary Austin to provide a range of military capabilities to Florida
   * FEMA to open disaster recovery centers across the impacted communities right away
   * Federal agencies to mobilize resources, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s mortgage relief for impacted homeowners
* The U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are assessing how fast they can reopen the Port of Tampa to get fuel, food, water, and other basic goods flowing into the area again
* The Federal Aviation Administration has authorized Florida Power and Light to fly large drones to quickly assess damage so ground crews can restore power more quickly
* More than 50,000 powerline workers have come from around the U.S. and Canada to restore power
* FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell has been on the ground since last night and will continue to work with State and local partners to determine any unmet needs
* More than 1,000 federal personnel are on the ground

We know from previous hurricanes that it’s often the case that more lives are lost in the days following the storm than the actual storm itself. We strongly encourage everyone impacted by this storm to stay inside and off the roads – as downed power lines, debris, and road washouts are creating dangerous conditions. Please continue to shelter in place until local leaders give an all-clear.

We will continue to do everything in our power to help you recover and rebuild.

**Update 2 – October 11, 2024**

* More than 2,600 federal personnel remain on the ground
* Search and Rescue teams have supported more than 4,200 rescues and assists
* 50,000 workers are restoring power. Milton left over 3 million people without power – because of the dedication of these workers, more than 1 million people have had their power restored so far
* 1.2 million meals have been delivered, with another 1.6 million slated to be delivered today
* FEMA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Florida National Guard are on the ground helping the State clear debris to reopen roads for critical deliveries of food, water, tarps, and lifesaving supplies
* The U.S. Coast Guard continues to lead the effort to assess how fast we can reopen the Port of Tampa for essential deliveries of goods and fuel

Our Administration continues to reiterate that conspiracy theories and misinformation are harmful to those who most need the help. We will continue to provide all the resources necessary to rescue, recover, and rebuild.",2024-10-09 16:10:30

Here's a link to one of the news articles. Basically the Community has storm drains that the easement runs next to this woman's property and it needed repairs from the sounds of it. From what I have read it sounds like she bought the property in 2012 and the storm drainage system was put in in the 1980s, her argument is they didn't ask permission from her to put in the storm drains. So she single-handedly required everybody in the neighborhood to purchase flood insurance.

I'm just posting this because I'm astonished that someone can get away with damaging public infrastructure and it's a civil matter rather than criminal even though many homeowners have been harmed because of her actions.

I flared this as weather because anytime it rains these people have to contend with not potentially being able to drive to their homes and they have to sandbag perpetually.",2024-08-05 11:48:51

# FAQ

>**Should I leave?**

Run from water, hide from wind. Typically you only need to move tens of miles inland, not hundreds of miles. If you are on an island, not connected to the mainland, causeways will close *after* the storm.

If you are in an Evacuation Zone *you will not be forced to leave.* However Emergency Services will not be running during and possibly well after the storm as passed. If you have an emergency you are on your own until it is safe for Emergency Service to operate. They will not risk their life for yours.

Ultimately it is up to you to leave or not.

&#x200B;

>**What should I prepare?**

[See Disaster Supply Kit](https://www.floridadisaster.org/planprepare/hurricane-supply-checklist/). Please remember pets are family too! Include them in your planning. If you leave, please take them with you.

Bring in anything outside that isn't nailed down. Do not throw patio furniture in the pool - can can both damaged your pool and the furniture (rust).

If you do any tree trimming in the days leading up to the storm ***DO NOT*** leave it on the curb, bring it into your garage. All you will do is make an easy flying projectile to your house and neighbor's houses.

&#x200B;

>**How long should I expect to be without power?**

The best place to ask is your neighbors. If they've been around for a few storms they generally have a good gauge on how long they are usually without power after a storm.

FPL & Duke work on getting power back to the most people the fastest. So if you are on a grid with fewer people you may be waiting the longest.

&#x200B;

>**Should I cancel my flight? Will my flight be delayed/cancelled?**

Check the ""Arrival Time of Tropical Force Winds"" if your flight is landing/leaving near that time, expect cancellations.

[Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‘soon’.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it’s not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can’t see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‘escorting’ a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‘wide load’ sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm…) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while…. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, “Now that you’ve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?”  The response: “Sir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.” I’ll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy’s awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don’t need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‘fund raiser mode’, but the time I actually need one?

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.)

* President Biden granted emergency declarations to the State of Florida and the Seminole Tribe of Florida to help cover costs for life-safety and life-sustaining actions ahead of the storm
* FEMA surged search and rescue teams, water, food, power generators, and ambulances to the region
* FEMA is prepared to coordinate a full-fledged federal response
* Administrator Deanne Criswell will be in Florida to oversee the response

Evacuation orders are in effect in multiple counties. If you are in evacuation zones and have not left the area yet, you should do so immediately for your safety. Emergency shelters are open and transportation assistance is available. If you can’t evacuate, or need a safe place to go, text SHELTER & your zip code to 4-3-3-6-2 to get a list of open shelters near you.

We will be there with you as you weather this new storm.

**Update 1 – October 10, 2024**

* President Biden and Vice President Harris have been in constant contact with State and local officials
* President Biden has directed:
   * Defense Secretary Austin to provide a range of military capabilities to Florida
   * FEMA to open disaster recovery centers across the impacted communities right away
   * Federal agencies to mobilize resources, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s mortgage relief for impacted homeowners
* The U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are assessing how fast they can reopen the Port of Tampa to get fuel, food, water, and other basic goods flowing into the area again
* The Federal Aviation Administration has authorized Florida Power and Light to fly large drones to quickly assess damage so ground crews can restore power more quickly
* More than 50,000 powerline workers have come from around the U.S. and Canada to restore power
* FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell has been on the ground since last night and will continue to work with State and local partners to determine any unmet needs
* More than 1,000 federal personnel are on the ground

We know from previous hurricanes that it’s often the case that more lives are lost in the days following the storm than the actual storm itself. We strongly encourage everyone impacted by this storm to stay inside and off the roads – as downed power lines, debris, and road washouts are creating dangerous conditions. Please continue to shelter in place until local leaders give an all-clear.

We will continue to do everything in our power to help you recover and rebuild.

**Update 2 – October 11, 2024**

* More than 2,600 federal personnel remain on the ground
* Search and Rescue teams have supported more than 4,200 rescues and assists
* 50,000 workers are restoring power. Milton left over 3 million people without power – because of the dedication of these workers, more than 1 million people have had their power restored so far
* 1.2 million meals have been delivered, with another 1.6 million slated to be delivered today
* FEMA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Florida National Guard are on the ground helping the State clear debris to reopen roads for critical deliveries of food, water, tarps, and lifesaving supplies
* The U.S. Coast Guard continues to lead the effort to assess how fast we can reopen the Port of Tampa for essential deliveries of goods and fuel

Our Administration continues to reiterate that conspiracy theories and misinformation are harmful to those who most need the help. We will continue to provide all the resources necessary to rescue, recover, and rebuild.",2024-10-09 16:10:30

Here's a link to one of the news articles. Basically the Community has storm drains that the easement runs next to this woman's property and it needed repairs from the sounds of it. From what I have read it sounds like she bought the property in 2012 and the storm drainage system was put in in the 1980s, her argument is they didn't ask permission from her to put in the storm drains. So she single-handedly required everybody in the neighborhood to purchase flood insurance.

I'm just posting this because I'm astonished that someone can get away with damaging public infrastructure and it's a civil matter rather than criminal even though many homeowners have been harmed because of her actions.

1039,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, happy",My husband and I lived through our first tornado,"Around 5 PM the day of the hurricane, 3 or so hours before the storm was supposed to affect us at all, my husband and I lived through our first tornado. Just minutes after being outside finishing putting up makeshift shutters and putting things away that could go flying in the hurricane.
I said ""Babe, we've had a long day preparing and neither of us have eaten any food. We REALLY need to go inside"" I said it with some urgency, and even felt that it was important we go inside and rest.
We sat down inside, I took one bite of my food. Then I felt an urge to pray. I put down my food and prayed out loud with my husband for God's protection in the path of this storm and that He would keep us and those in it's path safe. I thanked God for our home and all of our blessings.
A minute or two later, I got a tornado warning on my phone... And all of the sudden, very quickly, the whole trailer (yes, trailer!) is shaking violently, and through one of the windows with unfinished makeshift ""shutters"", I saw it pass through our yard. I screamed at the top of my lungs to my husband to get under something! ""ITS A F^$&@<$ TORNADO, GET DOWN"" I yelled. Minutes before this my mom had been texting me urgently about tornadoes cropping up all over our county. She kept warning me. She said to get a helmet if I hear a train. When the tornado hit, I dove under my heavy desk with my helmet on and waited in the fetal position until I thought it was gone.
And once it had passed, my husband and I went outside to survey the damage...
Almost every tree around our property has been downed. For the record, we basically live in a little rainforest. We used to not be able to see into amy of our neighbor's yards.
One tree fell into the roof but didn't do any major damage. Our plants are all destroyed, backyard has been just torn and shredded to pieces. This tornado ripped stuff up like it was nothing. Meanwhile, in our shanty little trailer, fortified only with shutters we literally made out of garbage we had, my husband and I are perfectly fine. At this point we are both totally in shock.
We decided very quickly to put all of our most valuable possessions together and leave before the actual hurricane hit. Thankfully my brother-in-law and his wife are so hospitable and welcomed us right in.
If all of my things got destroyed but my husband and I are still alive, I'm happy. The tornado was so unexpected and came before the storm was even here. I believe the timing of us going inside and taking cover had to be God's timing. We are so thankful for God's protection and we have plans to help our community and the surrounding communities in the aftermath of this monster of a storm.  Others near us were not nearly so lucky. People died in cities all around us. It's so so tragic. Brick homes were taken out by tornadoes in neighborhoods near us. Many people died. Please pray for the families affected by this awful tragedy, and also those still recovering from Hurricane Helene and now dealing with more trouble from Milton. Farther North people had to be evacuated. I have no clue how North Florida is but I can not imagine. I have full plans to go out and do as much disaster relief as possible. A week ago before we knew about Milton, I was passing out flyers trying to get people to donate supplies to Helene's victims. It's all so scary.
Thank you for your thoughts and prayers. So many weren't so lucky as us yesterday and it's not all over yet.
Praying for those who lost homes or worse, family... God bless these people. Thanking God for his provision and timing today.",2024-10-12 13:57:42

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19

I touched Snow in '76, I remember the three year drought. We have ridden out every hurricane, due to great luck and a calming sense of preparation and resolve. Last year around this time, a storm flooded the low areas. Sponge Docks lost many businesses. And the drive through during clean up, and see people's personal posessions strewn along the curb, in moldy piles awaiting pickup. 
 Here we are, the same houses, the same streets, and more. Much worse than last time. How many times? A serious question for those rebuilding the same way, in the same place. With no consideration for the location, and actual materials.

It's like retro fitting for earthquake on old buildings. No first floor wood flooring, tile would be nice. That sort of thing.

# FAQ

>**Should I leave?**

Run from water, hide from wind. Typically you only need to move tens of miles inland, not hundreds of miles. If you are on an island, not connected to the mainland, causeways will close *after* the storm.

If you are in an Evacuation Zone *you will not be forced to leave.* However Emergency Services will not be running during and possibly well after the storm as passed. If you have an emergency you are on your own until it is safe for Emergency Service to operate. They will not risk their life for yours.

Ultimately it is up to you to leave or not.

&#x200B;

>**What should I prepare?**

[See Disaster Supply Kit](https://www.floridadisaster.org/planprepare/hurricane-supply-checklist/). Please remember pets are family too! Include them in your planning. If you leave, please take them with you.

Bring in anything outside that isn't nailed down. Do not throw patio furniture in the pool - can can both damaged your pool and the furniture (rust).

If you do any tree trimming in the days leading up to the storm ***DO NOT*** leave it on the curb, bring it into your garage. All you will do is make an easy flying projectile to your house and neighbor's houses.

&#x200B;

>**How long should I expect to be without power?**

The best place to ask is your neighbors. If they've been around for a few storms they generally have a good gauge on how long they are usually without power after a storm.

FPL & Duke work on getting power back to the most people the fastest. So if you are on a grid with fewer people you may be waiting the longest.

&#x200B;

>**Should I cancel my flight? Will my flight be delayed/cancelled?**

Check the ""Arrival Time of Tropical Force Winds"" if your flight is landing/leaving near that time, expect cancellations.

1053,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, happy",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.
 
I’m curious what you all have to say.",2024-06-12 14:37:32

1075,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US – all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07

1088,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, annoyed",Quick Update on the Biden-Harris Administration’s Response to Hurricane Milton.,"President Biden has directed his Administration to do everything possible to prepare for Hurricane Milton:

* President Biden granted emergency declarations to the State of Florida and the Seminole Tribe of Florida to help cover costs for life-safety and life-sustaining actions ahead of the storm
* FEMA surged search and rescue teams, water, food, power generators, and ambulances to the region
* FEMA is prepared to coordinate a full-fledged federal response
* Administrator Deanne Criswell will be in Florida to oversee the response

Evacuation orders are in effect in multiple counties. If you are in evacuation zones and have not left the area yet, you should do so immediately for your safety. Emergency shelters are open and transportation assistance is available. If you can’t evacuate, or need a safe place to go, text SHELTER & your zip code to 4-3-3-6-2 to get a list of open shelters near you.

We will be there with you as you weather this new storm.

**Update 1 – October 10, 2024**

* President Biden and Vice President Harris have been in constant contact with State and local officials
* President Biden has directed:
   * Defense Secretary Austin to provide a range of military capabilities to Florida
   * FEMA to open disaster recovery centers across the impacted communities right away
   * Federal agencies to mobilize resources, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s mortgage relief for impacted homeowners
* The U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are assessing how fast they can reopen the Port of Tampa to get fuel, food, water, and other basic goods flowing into the area again
* The Federal Aviation Administration has authorized Florida Power and Light to fly large drones to quickly assess damage so ground crews can restore power more quickly
* More than 50,000 powerline workers have come from around the U.S. and Canada to restore power
* FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell has been on the ground since last night and will continue to work with State and local partners to determine any unmet needs
* More than 1,000 federal personnel are on the ground

We know from previous hurricanes that it’s often the case that more lives are lost in the days following the storm than the actual storm itself. We strongly encourage everyone impacted by this storm to stay inside and off the roads – as downed power lines, debris, and road washouts are creating dangerous conditions. Please continue to shelter in place until local leaders give an all-clear.

We will continue to do everything in our power to help you recover and rebuild.

**Update 2 – October 11, 2024**

* More than 2,600 federal personnel remain on the ground
* Search and Rescue teams have supported more than 4,200 rescues and assists
* 50,000 workers are restoring power. Milton left over 3 million people without power – because of the dedication of these workers, more than 1 million people have had their power restored so far
* 1.2 million meals have been delivered, with another 1.6 million slated to be delivered today
* FEMA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Florida National Guard are on the ground helping the State clear debris to reopen roads for critical deliveries of food, water, tarps, and lifesaving supplies
* The U.S. Coast Guard continues to lead the effort to assess how fast we can reopen the Port of Tampa for essential deliveries of goods and fuel

Our Administration continues to reiterate that conspiracy theories and misinformation are harmful to those who most need the help. We will continue to provide all the resources necessary to rescue, recover, and rebuild.",2024-10-09 16:10:30

Here's a link to one of the news articles. Basically the Community has storm drains that the easement runs next to this woman's property and it needed repairs from the sounds of it. From what I have read it sounds like she bought the property in 2012 and the storm drainage system was put in in the 1980s, her argument is they didn't ask permission from her to put in the storm drains. So she single-handedly required everybody in the neighborhood to purchase flood insurance.

I'm just posting this because I'm astonished that someone can get away with damaging public infrastructure and it's a civil matter rather than criminal even though many homeowners have been harmed because of her actions.

I flared this as weather because anytime it rains these people have to contend with not potentially being able to drive to their homes and they have to sandbag perpetually.",2024-08-05 11:48:51

# FAQ

>**Should I leave?**

Run from water, hide from wind. Typically you only need to move tens of miles inland, not hundreds of miles. If you are on an island, not connected to the mainland, causeways will close *after* the storm.

If you are in an Evacuation Zone *you will not be forced to leave.* However Emergency Services will not be running during and possibly well after the storm as passed. If you have an emergency you are on your own until it is safe for Emergency Service to operate. They will not risk their life for yours.

Ultimately it is up to you to leave or not.

&#x200B;

>**What should I prepare?**

[See Disaster Supply Kit](https://www.floridadisaster.org/planprepare/hurricane-supply-checklist/). Please remember pets are family too! Include them in your planning. If you leave, please take them with you.

Bring in anything outside that isn't nailed down. Do not throw patio furniture in the pool - can can both damaged your pool and the furniture (rust).

If you do any tree trimming in the days leading up to the storm ***DO NOT*** leave it on the curb, bring it into your garage. All you will do is make an easy flying projectile to your house and neighbor's houses.

&#x200B;

>**How long should I expect to be without power?**

The best place to ask is your neighbors. If they've been around for a few storms they generally have a good gauge on how long they are usually without power after a storm.

FPL & Duke work on getting power back to the most people the fastest. So if you are on a grid with fewer people you may be waiting the longest.

&#x200B;

>**Should I cancel my flight? Will my flight be delayed/cancelled?**

Check the ""Arrival Time of Tropical Force Winds"" if your flight is landing/leaving near that time, expect cancellations.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03

1138,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, annoyed",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‘Dial *FHP for emergency’.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‘soon’.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it’s not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can’t see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‘escorting’ a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‘wide load’ sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm…) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while…. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, “Now that you’ve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?”  The response: “Sir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.” I’ll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy’s awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don’t need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‘fund raiser mode’, but the time I actually need one?

* President Biden granted emergency declarations to the State of Florida and the Seminole Tribe of Florida to help cover costs for life-safety and life-sustaining actions ahead of the storm
* FEMA surged search and rescue teams, water, food, power generators, and ambulances to the region
* FEMA is prepared to coordinate a full-fledged federal response
* Administrator Deanne Criswell will be in Florida to oversee the response

Evacuation orders are in effect in multiple counties. If you are in evacuation zones and have not left the area yet, you should do so immediately for your safety. Emergency shelters are open and transportation assistance is available. If you can’t evacuate, or need a safe place to go, text SHELTER & your zip code to 4-3-3-6-2 to get a list of open shelters near you.

We will be there with you as you weather this new storm.

**Update 1 – October 10, 2024**

* President Biden and Vice President Harris have been in constant contact with State and local officials
* President Biden has directed:
   * Defense Secretary Austin to provide a range of military capabilities to Florida
   * FEMA to open disaster recovery centers across the impacted communities right away
   * Federal agencies to mobilize resources, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s mortgage relief for impacted homeowners
* The U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are assessing how fast they can reopen the Port of Tampa to get fuel, food, water, and other basic goods flowing into the area again
* The Federal Aviation Administration has authorized Florida Power and Light to fly large drones to quickly assess damage so ground crews can restore power more quickly
* More than 50,000 powerline workers have come from around the U.S. and Canada to restore power
* FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell has been on the ground since last night and will continue to work with State and local partners to determine any unmet needs
* More than 1,000 federal personnel are on the ground

We know from previous hurricanes that it’s often the case that more lives are lost in the days following the storm than the actual storm itself. We strongly encourage everyone impacted by this storm to stay inside and off the roads – as downed power lines, debris, and road washouts are creating dangerous conditions. Please continue to shelter in place until local leaders give an all-clear.

We will continue to do everything in our power to help you recover and rebuild.

**Update 2 – October 11, 2024**

* More than 2,600 federal personnel remain on the ground
* Search and Rescue teams have supported more than 4,200 rescues and assists
* 50,000 workers are restoring power. Milton left over 3 million people without power – because of the dedication of these workers, more than 1 million people have had their power restored so far
* 1.2 million meals have been delivered, with another 1.6 million slated to be delivered today
* FEMA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Florida National Guard are on the ground helping the State clear debris to reopen roads for critical deliveries of food, water, tarps, and lifesaving supplies
* The U.S. Coast Guard continues to lead the effort to assess how fast we can reopen the Port of Tampa for essential deliveries of goods and fuel

Our Administration continues to reiterate that conspiracy theories and misinformation are harmful to those who most need the help. We will continue to provide all the resources necessary to rescue, recover, and rebuild.",2024-10-09 16:10:30

The heat is only getting hotter, summer after summer, which is the trend.

Hurricanes and storms are getting more catastrophic. Each year is playing Russian roulette in terms of what part of the state is getting ""the big one"". 


I live in a coastal city, which is experiencing more frequent flooding of the streets, especially during King tides, which are worse than ever these last few years. 


Property values and rent are out of control. 


Homeowners insurance is laughable right now. How many insurance companies have stopped doing business in the state? How is this sustainable or affordable long term?


The republican leadership in this state is doing NOTHING about any of the following above and essentially are ignoring the big fat elephant in the state. 


Why would any business or person wish to invest in this state long-term knowing that all of these issues are going to get worse if they're not addressed?

# FAQ

>**Should I leave?**

Run from water, hide from wind. Typically you only need to move tens of miles inland, not hundreds of miles. If you are on an island, not connected to the mainland, causeways will close *after* the storm.

If you are in an Evacuation Zone *you will not be forced to leave.* However Emergency Services will not be running during and possibly well after the storm as passed. If you have an emergency you are on your own until it is safe for Emergency Service to operate. They will not risk their life for yours.

Ultimately it is up to you to leave or not.

&#x200B;

>**What should I prepare?**

[See Disaster Supply Kit](https://www.floridadisaster.org/planprepare/hurricane-supply-checklist/). Please remember pets are family too! Include them in your planning. If you leave, please take them with you.

Bring in anything outside that isn't nailed down. Do not throw patio furniture in the pool - can can both damaged your pool and the furniture (rust).

If you do any tree trimming in the days leading up to the storm ***DO NOT*** leave it on the curb, bring it into your garage. All you will do is make an easy flying projectile to your house and neighbor's houses.

>**How long should I expect to be without power?**

The best place to ask is your neighbors. If they've been around for a few storms they generally have a good gauge on how long they are usually without power after a storm.

FPL & Duke work on getting power back to the most people the fastest. So if you are on a grid with fewer people you may be waiting the longest.

&#x200B;

>**Should I cancel my flight? Will my flight be delayed/cancelled?**

Check the ""Arrival Time of Tropical Force Winds"" if your flight is landing/leaving near that time, expect cancellations.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03

1195,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, comfortable",Which room would be safer?,"Hi, so my NE Florida family is staying at home for the storm. We don’t live in a flood zone so the onto threat is winds. Apparently we’re getting at least 40 MPH sustained winds and 60 MPH gusts. That wouldn’t be too bad, except we live in a neighborhood with lots of trees and have woods behind our house. And the winds will be pushing the trees towards us.

We’re debating whether to sleep in the bedroom or living room. I’ve put together some pros and cons for both.

**Bedroom**

Pros:

* Will actually be able to sleep
* Has less windows than living room
* Right next to tornado safe room

Cons:

* Faces woods, very much in reach of trees
* Almost died in Irma here due to falling tree

**Living room**

Pros:

* Can’t be hit by any trees
* Easier to see what’s happening from here

Cons:

* Probably won’t sleep at all
* Has more windows
* A bit farther from safe room (only by a few seconds, but those seconds can matter)

What do y‘all think? I feel like the bedroom would be more comfortable since it actually has a bed we can sleep on, but the living room would be safer.

EDIT: Oh, yeah. I realized another problem with the living room. We have an insane kitten who loves to attack our other cats. So we lock him in the bedroom at night. But if nobody’s in there, we can’t do that. ",2024-10-08 18:37:47

1202,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, storm, comfortable",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‘Dial *FHP for emergency’.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‘soon’.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it’s not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can’t see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‘escorting’ a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‘wide load’ sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm…) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while…. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, “Now that you’ve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?”  The response: “Sir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.” I’ll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy’s awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don’t need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‘fund raiser mode’, but the time I actually need one?

The first of my ancestors arrived to survey the Everglades. I’ve tried to leave but I just find this place to be too magical not to return to. 

The manatees in the springs. The alligators so old and so perfect that evolution found no need to change them in 8 million years. The ocean and all its fruit. The sunny winters and thunderstorms in the summer. The cypress trees towering above the swamps and tanned rivers. The Spanish moss hanging from old oaks so gracefully it feels like a painting from one’s dreams- I just can’t imagine wanting to be anywhere else and so I stay, raising my families 8th generation of Floridan, lending a hand to my fellow Floridians as we rebuild. 

There are enough threads on why people hate Florida or anxious to tell someone why they’re leaving, so I’m curious, why do you stay? Tell me what you love so much that ties you to our beloved land? Please, save the negativity for another thread, there is enough of them. ",2024-10-01 18:10:44

I want to update you with my new plans to visit your country. I got very many tips in the open comments and also in the privates. Link to the post before below.

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19

I'm from Texas and I totally get the misconceptions that certain states get but I was blown away in Florida. 

I spent a month in FTL then a week in Sarasota and night in Tallahassee. I'd love to spend more time in Tampa and Tallahassee! Tampa seems like a chiller/smaller Dallas on the ocean, with slightly more culture lol. Tallahassee is so incredibly beautiful with all the greenery and live oaks! 

There's so much to do! South Florida has so much access, to the Keys, Everglades, 2 major cruise ports, 3 large airports, amazing beaches, food, I could go on... 

Overall I was impressed with people! Everyone was so nice and chill! The drivers are insane (as they are in Dallas) but I found people were so much more genuinely nice than anticipated. (I blame Miami for the bad rap). 

All the nature and world class beaches really are just so amazing. FTL really has great access to beaches. And while I know the iguanas are invasive, I love lizards and found them fascinating. 

Side note: your summers are a notch down compared to Texas. Yes its hot. Yes it's humid. But at least yall get regular days of clouds or thunderstorms. That's exceedingly rare in Texas. you can't skimp on that sunscreen or hat though! The sun is no joke.

I feel like we are not taking care of Florida. We are changing it into something unenjoyable. I feel like some people are caught up in making Florida ""theirs"", when in reality, Florida is for not just one. Florida is a piece of land that is extremely diverse in plants and animals.

1226,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, thunderstorm, love",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

But I have this fear, it always seems like everybody is talking about leaving Florida, but they never seem to actually do it.  Furthermore, people who do, it often seems like they end up back in short time.  One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.  

So what I am asking here, is there any success stories from former Floridians who moved away and loved it? Or just anybody who can share some experiences? I deeply fear falling into the ""grass is greener"" trap, but then finding out the grass is yellow everywhere.

1233,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, thunderstorm, love",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I’m 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami’s airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! 👀 wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I’ve ever been too, and I’ve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I’ve ever experienced; and I’ve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I’m going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I’m heading to Tampa which I’m very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! 😋

Anywho, just wanted to holler and tell you how cool I thought this state was, not being in the touristy Orlando spots. I hope to come down here and go camping in panther country some day. I had no idea panther crossing were a real thing before today?! I’m just blown away with how much there is to do, and eat down here–it’s endless! What a cool f’n place.

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating. I'd be giving up everything I love, even down to the food, weather, and geography.

1255,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, thunderstorm, love",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

1259,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, thunderstorm, love",Please Help Us Understand How Communities Respond to Disasters!,"Hi Reddit! 👋 We're participating in a hackathon focused on improving community resilience during natural disasters, and we need your insights! When extreme weather events hit—floods, hurricanes, wildfires—evacuations and rescues become critical, but sometimes, resources and helping hands are limited. We're exploring ideas to strengthen our communities and would love to hear from you.

**The Concept:** Imagine a community where, in times of disaster, those with the means (vehicles, boats, safe spaces) not only ensure their own evacuation but also assist others in need. This support wouldn’t just be voluntary; there would be incentives—things like tax breaks, gift cards, or community points that could be redeemed for local benefits.

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **If you had resources to help during a disaster (like a truck, extra room, etc.), would incentives motivate you to help others evacuate?**
2. **What types of incentives do you think would encourage people in your community to step up in times of crisis?**
3. **What barriers would prevent you from helping others in a disaster situation?**
4. **What’s one thing you think your community could do better to be prepared for an emergency?**

Your feedback could help shape a new solution that empowers communities to be more resilient in the face of climate challenges. If you have personal stories, ideas, or thoughts on the incentives system, please drop a comment below!

Hurricanes aren’t new & people have always chose to live here despite their ferociousness. Why will vary person to person so I can only answer for myself. 

I’m 7th generation and my family was here before the civil war. My roots go so deep my great grandmother was even raised in a lighthouse her sister (my great aunt) husband operated and maintained. The first of my ancestors arrived to survey the Everglades. I’ve tried to leave but I just find this place to be too magical not to return to. 

The manatees in the springs. The alligators so old and so perfect that evolution found no need to change them in 8 million years. The ocean and all its fruit. The sunny winters and thunderstorms in the summer. The cypress trees towering above the swamps and tanned rivers. The Spanish moss hanging from old oaks so gracefully it feels like a painting from one’s dreams- I just can’t imagine wanting to be anywhere else and so I stay, raising my families 8th generation of Floridan, lending a hand to my fellow Floridians as we rebuild.

1273,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, thunderstorm, hate",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

Nice to see some justice in our country again and helping me look at the better side of things.  I've been so focused on my disgust of DeSantis and the policy makers here, the school board in Sarasota where my children go to school and so on that I've stopped taking time to appreciate some of the special things about Florida that I love.  So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

My husband and I are planning to go somewhere for my spring break - end of March.  I know this is prime spring breaker time.  We would love to be somewhere away from drunk college kids and screaming children (no kids of our own and I'm a teacher so I need a break from them).  No interest in any theme parks or nightlife.  We love national parks, hiking, wildlife, botanical gardens, maybe a nice seafood dinner or two (but don't mind cooking for ourselves).  I know basically every beach will be crowded at this time, and we'd be willing to deal with that for a couple of beach days as long as it was a more chill vibe.  We thought it'd be cool to try our hand at snorkeling.  A boat ride of some sort would be cool.

Any recommendations for areas to look into?  We'd prefer an airbnb or private home rental (if it had a private pool I'd be in absolute heaven) and will probably rent a car after flying in.

So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do?

1290,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, thunderstorm, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

1291,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, thunderstorm, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06

Florida is essentially developed swampland, sure but Florida has a desirable climate, low taxes, and lots of corporations are moving here. Home prices here have gone up FASTER than the average ever since the invention of home air conditioning, florida has always had more inflow for most of y’all’s lives, for a reason.

I own a cabin in Anchorage AK, I bought it to fish, and avoid paying taxes on a work bonus. I’d kill myself if I had to live there. Believe it or not, but most people don’t like the cold. Most of the land area in the US gets pretty cold(below freezing lows for at least 1/3 of the year) and people are free to spend their money and move wherever they want.

Supply and demand forces are at play, many of us who are not homeowners may never own a home here, it sucks BIG, but that’s how it works. Same shit happened in Hawaii, bulldozed native homes to build ostentatious beachfront homes, LA, San Diego, Phoenix, Arizona, you think you’re special?. That’s just the name of game, jit. That’s how capitalism works. Prices don’t go up because it sucks living here. The brutal winters in NYC sucked asshole. The summer “nights” at the cabin suck asshole.

Every place with a appealing climate is gonna get rocked with not affordable CoL, that’s how it works, that’s how it has worked and it’s how it will always work.

Don’t have a gripe because people want to live in a nicer place, with nicer weather, with nicer tax treatment. That’s petty, makes you look childish.

If you’re dead set on hating someone because you’ll never own a home here, hate Airbnb, OpenDoor, and Zillow, don’t hate people because they see an opportunity to live a better life, fuck that.

Snowbirds though… fuck em(because they don’t contribute to society and drive like crap) but once again, what can you do, they got the money, they’re gonna do what they’re gonna do.",2023-01-15 03:22:03

While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous.

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19

1308,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, thunderstorm, enjoy",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

Is there a chance the state will become politically moderate again as it was in the past, or has the anti-LGBT lunacy really taken over the majority of the population? Just about every post/comment here is filled with negativity about the political situation, and it seems like the political shift is mostly due to the northern region (which has always been conservative), and the number of older people moving there since Covid.

1311,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, thunderstorm, enjoy",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do?

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

I want to update you with my new plans to visit your country. I got very many tips in the open comments and also in the privates. Link to the post before below.

https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/s/zPy0XbmLln

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19

1375,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, thunderstorm, happy",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03

1382,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, thunderstorm, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US – all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07

1384,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, thunderstorm, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‘Dial *FHP for emergency’.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‘soon’.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it’s not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can’t see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‘escorting’ a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‘wide load’ sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm…) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while…. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, “Now that you’ve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?”  The response: “Sir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.” I’ll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy’s awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don’t need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‘fund raiser mode’, but the time I actually need one?

BTW- the inside of a lighting bolt is bright yellow.",2023-08-06 19:47:46

People do not care if they’ll run you over(they’ll get away with it) it was incredibly frustrating because I liked the workout.i like getting exercise when I can get, and the weather is getting tolerable

I’ve never been shown a greater amount of disrespect by the general public than on a bicycle. Nobody yields, nobody gives space, people will purposely vroom past you, it seriously felt like I was vilified by society like I was some murderer.

No i wasn’t one of those annoying bicyclists that ride in the middle of the road or one that has a chip on their shoulder. I’m 20 years old, riding my bike to the library or a friends house so I can go use the computer to do schoolwork because I can’t do it at home. I always rode on the sidewalk whenever possible but there’s sometimes no sidewalk. And I’ve almost been hit a couple of times. Dead before I can legally drink because I don’t have a car was a wild thought. I will never ever ride a bike on public areas again. I have a car again, and seriously it takes zero effort to let a bicycle cross the fucking street or give them some space. What is wrong with our country?

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19

I feel like we are not taking care of Florida. We are changing it into something unenjoyable. I feel like some people are caught up in making Florida ""theirs"", when in reality, Florida is for not just one. Florida is a piece of land that is extremely diverse in plants and animals. Florida is for observation only.

I think Florida should be protected from demolition. We should all protect Florida from the bleaching that some people are bringing. The plants and animals can't vote or talk, so we need to do it for them. Protect Florida!!!!!!!!!!!",2023-05-12 18:59:29

But I find it entertaining whenever I visit. I live in CT where it’s great and safe but so uneventful it gets boring/depressing, especially since it’s cold from Oct-April. So whenever I visit FL (Tampa Bay and Miami) I feel “alive”. From what I’ve seen is just a normal state where people live normal lives, nothing out of this world. I’m sure it’s different when you live there. Besides the weather, what’s so bad about it?

1423,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, misty, love",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

But I have this fear, it always seems like everybody is talking about leaving Florida, but they never seem to actually do it.  Furthermore, people who do, it often seems like they end up back in short time.  One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.  

So what I am asking here, is there any success stories from former Floridians who moved away and loved it? Or just anybody who can share some experiences? I deeply fear falling into the ""grass is greener"" trap, but then finding out the grass is yellow everywhere.  But I do feel like in my heart of hearts deep down I should relocate before my mental sanity flies off the handle in extremely crowded and busy area I live.",2023-04-30 17:30:36

1429,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, misty, love",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

We would love to be somewhere away from drunk college kids and screaming children (no kids of our own and I'm a teacher so I need a break from them).  No interest in any theme parks or nightlife.  We love national parks, hiking, wildlife, botanical gardens, maybe a nice seafood dinner or two (but don't mind cooking for ourselves).  I know basically every beach will be crowded at this time, and we'd be willing to deal with that for a couple of beach days as long as it was a more chill vibe.  We thought it'd be cool to try our hand at snorkeling.  A boat ride of some sort would be cool.

Any recommendations for areas to look into?  We'd prefer an airbnb or private home rental (if it had a private pool I'd be in absolute heaven) and will probably rent a car after flying in.

We are in early 40s and considering buying a land (may be 2-4 ac lot) and get it constructed and use most of the portion in gardening and growing our own food.

Generally 2ac or more lots are available in outskirts of these cities. we like more of the rural communities and we might be Ok with this. Do we need to worry about security concerns in outskirts?

1441,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, misty, love",Just did a great work trip through Florida! What a cool state.,"Hello Floridians of Reddit!

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I’m 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami’s airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! 👀 wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I’ve ever been too, and I’ve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I’ve ever experienced; and I’ve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I’m going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I’m heading to Tampa which I’m very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! 😋

Anywho, just wanted to holler and tell you how cool I thought this state was, not being in the touristy Orlando spots. I hope to come down here and go camping in panther country some day. I had no idea panther crossing were a real thing before today?! I’m just blown away with how much there is to do, and eat down here–it’s endless! What a cool f’n place. It was 35* and snowing when I left Utah. Y’all have it to good!",2023-03-23 21:46:57

When I visited my sister in October, I liked how it felt like vacation…but was kind of uncomfortable. The humidity was insane, my allergies were on max, and I was itchy as soon as I walked out the door. 

My sister is trying to convince me to move down to Orlando where she lives, but she makes nearly 6 figures in a remote position in a company based in NYC. I don’t make that much money. She’s trying to sell me a dream and tells me I’m “scared” and overthinking when I think I’m being cautious lol. I also have to consider expenses. 

My other options are Northern Virginia, DC, PA, NJ. 

I was looking through the sub and instead of asking about pros and cons, tell me why you’re leaving. I’d love to hear from those of you who moved from the Northeast and are leaving the state. 

Mostly so that I can give my sister actual reasons she can’t argue about because she can’t take “no” as an answer.

I know I’ll get downvoted based on “we’re full!” Lol 😂

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating.

1449,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, misty, love",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

1453,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, misty, love",Please Help Us Understand How Communities Respond to Disasters!,"Hi Reddit! 👋 We're participating in a hackathon focused on improving community resilience during natural disasters, and we need your insights! When extreme weather events hit—floods, hurricanes, wildfires—evacuations and rescues become critical, but sometimes, resources and helping hands are limited. We're exploring ideas to strengthen our communities and would love to hear from you.

**The Concept:** Imagine a community where, in times of disaster, those with the means (vehicles, boats, safe spaces) not only ensure their own evacuation but also assist others in need. This support wouldn’t just be voluntary; there would be incentives—things like tax breaks, gift cards, or community points that could be redeemed for local benefits.

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **If you had resources to help during a disaster (like a truck, extra room, etc.), would incentives motivate you to help others evacuate?**
2. **What types of incentives do you think would encourage people in your community to step up in times of crisis?**
3. **What barriers would prevent you from helping others in a disaster situation?**
4. **What’s one thing you think your community could do better to be prepared for an emergency?**

Your feedback could help shape a new solution that empowers communities to be more resilient in the face of climate challenges. If you have personal stories, ideas, or thoughts on the incentives system, please drop a comment below!

But I find it entertaining whenever I visit. I live in CT where it’s great and safe but so uneventful it gets boring/depressing, especially since it’s cold from Oct-April. So whenever I visit FL (Tampa Bay and Miami) I feel “alive”. From what I’ve seen is just a normal state where people live normal lives, nothing out of this world. I’m sure it’s different when you live there. Besides the weather, what’s so bad about it?

1471,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, misty, hate",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

Nice to see some justice in our country again and helping me look at the better side of things.  I've been so focused on my disgust of DeSantis and the policy makers here, the school board in Sarasota where my children go to school and so on that I've stopped taking time to appreciate some of the special things about Florida that I love.  So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

1485,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, misty, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

1486,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, misty, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06

Florida is essentially developed swampland, sure but Florida has a desirable climate, low taxes, and lots of corporations are moving here. Home prices here have gone up FASTER than the average ever since the invention of home air conditioning, florida has always had more inflow for most of y’all’s lives, for a reason.

I own a cabin in Anchorage AK, I bought it to fish, and avoid paying taxes on a work bonus. I’d kill myself if I had to live there. Believe it or not, but most people don’t like the cold. Most of the land area in the US gets pretty cold(below freezing lows for at least 1/3 of the year) and people are free to spend their money and move wherever they want.

Supply and demand forces are at play, many of us who are not homeowners may never own a home here, it sucks BIG, but that’s how it works. Same shit happened in Hawaii, bulldozed native homes to build ostentatious beachfront homes, LA, San Diego, Phoenix, Arizona, you think you’re special?. That’s just the name of game, jit. That’s how capitalism works. Prices don’t go up because it sucks living here. The brutal winters in NYC sucked asshole. The summer “nights” at the cabin suck asshole.

Every place with a appealing climate is gonna get rocked with not affordable CoL, that’s how it works, that’s how it has worked and it’s how it will always work.

Don’t have a gripe because people want to live in a nicer place, with nicer weather, with nicer tax treatment. That’s petty, makes you look childish.

If you’re dead set on hating someone because you’ll never own a home here, hate Airbnb, OpenDoor, and Zillow, don’t hate people because they see an opportunity to live a better life, fuck that.

Snowbirds though… fuck em(because they don’t contribute to society and drive like crap) but once again, what can you do, they got the money, they’re gonna do what they’re gonna do.",2023-01-15 03:22:03

some of this is in my attached two-car garage right now, but i hate how swampy it is out there; it makes it difficult to even use it as a sorting and working space, and i see things getting a little rusty and i hate wondering if things are also risking mildew. (i have pretty severe allergies.)

someone suggested i consider installing a mini-split for the garage instead of doing storage. my garage door is already insulated, although its not an impact door, if that matters. 

would this mean i would put in another tiny AC unit-thing outside, next to the garage wall?

While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous.

1494,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, misty, enjoy",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.
 
I’m curious what you all have to say.",2024-06-12 14:37:32

Is there a chance the state will become politically moderate again as it was in the past, or has the anti-LGBT lunacy really taken over the majority of the population? Just about every post/comment here is filled with negativity about the political situation, and it seems like the political shift is mostly due to the northern region (which has always been conservative), and the number of older people moving there since Covid.

1496,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, misty, enjoy",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

1527,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, misty, happy",Happy Hurricane Season!,"Hurricane season starts June 1, and this one will be a doozy.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03
1528,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, misty, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US – all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07

1530,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, misty, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‘Dial *FHP for emergency’.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‘soon’.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it’s not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can’t see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‘escorting’ a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‘wide load’ sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm…) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while…. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, “Now that you’ve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?”  The response: “Sir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.” I’ll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy’s awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don’t need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‘fund raiser mode’, but the time I actually need one?

BTW- the inside of a lighting bolt is bright yellow.",2023-08-06 19:47:46

Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy.

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

But I have this fear, it always seems like everybody is talking about leaving Florida, but they never seem to actually do it.  Furthermore, people who do, it often seems like they end up back in short time.  One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.  

So what I am asking here, is there any success stories from former Floridians who moved away and loved it? Or just anybody who can share some experiences? I deeply fear falling into the ""grass is greener"" trap, but then finding out the grass is yellow everywhere.

1545,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, drizzle, love",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I’m 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami’s airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! 👀 wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I’ve ever been too, and I’ve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I’ve ever experienced; and I’ve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I’m going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I’m heading to Tampa which I’m very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! 😋

Anywho, just wanted to holler and tell you how cool I thought this state was, not being in the touristy Orlando spots. I hope to come down here and go camping in panther country some day. I had no idea panther crossing were a real thing before today?! I’m just blown away with how much there is to do, and eat down here–it’s endless! What a cool f’n place.

1565,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, drizzle, love",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

We plan on mainly visiting beaches, swimming, reading, enjoying the sun, laying by the pool etc. with maybe some day trips to maybe a botanical garden, maybe disney and such. But mainly the beach. We would also like to go on a Caribbean Cruise for one week.

Please give me some advice! I would really like to go to Florida but maybe it's better to visit some other time of year?

EDIT: Can add that we are thinking about maybe Key West and that we are from Sweden so if it rains where we are from it will usually rain all day long. And 22-25 degrees celsius is warm for us.",2024-01-19 14:28:44
1569,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, drizzle, love",Please Help Us Understand How Communities Respond to Disasters!,"Hi Reddit! 👋 We're participating in a hackathon focused on improving community resilience during natural disasters, and we need your insights! When extreme weather events hit—floods, hurricanes, wildfires—evacuations and rescues become critical, but sometimes, resources and helping hands are limited. We're exploring ideas to strengthen our communities and would love to hear from you.

**The Concept:** Imagine a community where, in times of disaster, those with the means (vehicles, boats, safe spaces) not only ensure their own evacuation but also assist others in need. This support wouldn’t just be voluntary; there would be incentives—things like tax breaks, gift cards, or community points that could be redeemed for local benefits.

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **If you had resources to help during a disaster (like a truck, extra room, etc.), would incentives motivate you to help others evacuate?**
2. **What types of incentives do you think would encourage people in your community to step up in times of crisis?**
3. **What barriers would prevent you from helping others in a disaster situation?**
4. **What’s one thing you think your community could do better to be prepared for an emergency?**

Your feedback could help shape a new solution that empowers communities to be more resilient in the face of climate challenges. If you have personal stories, ideas, or thoughts on the incentives system, please drop a comment below!

Thank you for helping us build a more resilient future! 🙏",2024-10-29 15:06:00

2. High Income Taxes

1587,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, drizzle, hate",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

I've been so focused on my disgust of DeSantis and the policy makers here, the school board in Sarasota where my children go to school and so on that I've stopped taking time to appreciate some of the special things about Florida that I love.  So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

1602,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, drizzle, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06

I’m 37 and I live with my parents. I make 67,000 a year and cannot afford my own place, I SHOULD HATE transplants according to y’all’s, but guess what? I don’t. You know why? Because that’s the name of the game, that’s right.

Florida is essentially developed swampland, sure but Florida has a desirable climate, low taxes, and lots of corporations are moving here. Home prices here have gone up FASTER than the average ever since the invention of home air conditioning, florida has always had more inflow for most of y’all’s lives, for a reason.

I own a cabin in Anchorage AK, I bought it to fish, and avoid paying taxes on a work bonus. I’d kill myself if I had to live there. Believe it or not, but most people don’t like the cold. Most of the land area in the US gets pretty cold(below freezing lows for at least 1/3 of the year) and people are free to spend their money and move wherever they want.

Supply and demand forces are at play, many of us who are not homeowners may never own a home here, it sucks BIG, but that’s how it works. Same shit happened in Hawaii, bulldozed native homes to build ostentatious beachfront homes, LA, San Diego, Phoenix, Arizona, you think you’re special?. That’s just the name of game, jit. That’s how capitalism works. Prices don’t go up because it sucks living here. The brutal winters in NYC sucked asshole. The summer “nights” at the cabin suck asshole.

Every place with a appealing climate is gonna get rocked with not affordable CoL, that’s how it works, that’s how it has worked and it’s how it will always work.

Don’t have a gripe because people want to live in a nicer place, with nicer weather, with nicer tax treatment. That’s petty, makes you look childish.

If you’re dead set on hating someone because you’ll never own a home here, hate Airbnb, OpenDoor, and Zillow, don’t hate people because they see an opportunity to live a better life, fuck that.

Snowbirds though… fuck em(because they don’t contribute to society and drive like crap) but once again, what can you do, they got the money, they’re gonna do what they’re gonna do.",2023-01-15 03:22:03

1. Terrible housing market (the low end for houses is $1M)
2. High Income Taxes
3. Terrible weather - hate the winter
4. No job opportunities

I'd only be able to move there by getting a TN visa from a work sponsorship.

While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous.

1610,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, drizzle, enjoy",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating. I'd be giving up everything I love, even down to the food, weather, and geography.

However reading about it it seems like a rainy month and it makes me think it might not be the best time to visit? I have visited once in April (or February or March I can't remember, it was a family trip when I was a kid)  and then the weather was lovely.

Does it rain all day every day with cloudy skies or what does it look like?

We plan on mainly visiting beaches, swimming, reading, enjoying the sun, laying by the pool etc. with maybe some day trips to maybe a botanical garden, maybe disney and such. But mainly the beach. We would also like to go on a Caribbean Cruise for one week.

Please give me some advice! I would really like to go to Florida but maybe it's better to visit some other time of year?

EDIT: Can add that we are thinking about maybe Key West and that we are from Sweden so if it rains where we are from it will usually rain all day long. And 22-25 degrees celsius is warm for us.",2024-01-19 14:28:44

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03
1644,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, drizzle, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US – all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago.

I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‘soon’.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it’s not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can’t see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‘escorting’ a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‘wide load’ sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm…) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while…. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, “Now that you’ve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?”  The response: “Sir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.” I’ll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy’s awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don’t need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‘fund raiser mode’, but the time I actually need one?

I’ve never been shown a greater amount of disrespect by the general public than on a bicycle. Nobody yields, nobody gives space, people will purposely vroom past you, it seriously felt like I was vilified by society like I was some murderer.

No i wasn’t one of those annoying bicyclists that ride in the middle of the road or one that has a chip on their shoulder. I’m 20 years old, riding my bike to the library or a friends house so I can go use the computer to do schoolwork because I can’t do it at home. I always rode on the sidewalk whenever possible but there’s sometimes no sidewalk. And I’ve almost been hit a couple of times. Dead before I can legally drink because I don’t have a car was a wild thought. I will never ever ride a bike on public areas again.

But I find it entertaining whenever I visit. I live in CT where it’s great and safe but so uneventful it gets boring/depressing, especially since it’s cold from Oct-April. So whenever I visit FL (Tampa Bay and Miami) I feel “alive”. From what I’ve seen is just a normal state where people live normal lives, nothing out of this world. I’m sure it’s different when you live there. Besides the weather, what’s so bad about it?

1655,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, downpour, love",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

But I have this fear, it always seems like everybody is talking about leaving Florida, but they never seem to actually do it.  Furthermore, people who do, it often seems like they end up back in short time.  One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.  

So what I am asking here, is there any success stories from former Floridians who moved away and loved it? Or just anybody who can share some experiences?

1661,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, downpour, love",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I’m 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami’s airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! 👀 wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I’ve ever been too, and I’ve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I’ve ever experienced; and I’ve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I’m going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I’m heading to Tampa which I’m very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! 😋

Anywho, just wanted to holler and tell you how cool I thought this state was, not being in the touristy Orlando spots. I hope to come down here and go camping in panther country some day. I had no idea panther crossing were a real thing before today?! I’m just blown away with how much there is to do, and eat down here–it’s endless! What a cool f’n place.

When I visited my sister in October, I liked how it felt like vacation…but was kind of uncomfortable. The humidity was insane, my allergies were on max, and I was itchy as soon as I walked out the door. 

My sister is trying to convince me to move down to Orlando where she lives, but she makes nearly 6 figures in a remote position in a company based in NYC. I don’t make that much money. She’s trying to sell me a dream and tells me I’m “scared” and overthinking when I think I’m being cautious lol. I also have to consider expenses. 

My other options are Northern Virginia, DC, PA, NJ. 

I was looking through the sub and instead of asking about pros and cons, tell me why you’re leaving. I’d love to hear from those of you who moved from the Northeast and are leaving the state. 

Mostly so that I can give my sister actual reasons she can’t argue about because she can’t take “no” as an answer.

I know I’ll get downvoted based on “we’re full!” Lol 😂

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating. I'd be giving up everything I love, even down to the food, weather, and geography.

1681,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, downpour, love",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

1685,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, downpour, love",Please Help Us Understand How Communities Respond to Disasters!,"Hi Reddit! 👋 We're participating in a hackathon focused on improving community resilience during natural disasters, and we need your insights! When extreme weather events hit—floods, hurricanes, wildfires—evacuations and rescues become critical, but sometimes, resources and helping hands are limited. We're exploring ideas to strengthen our communities and would love to hear from you.

**The Concept:** Imagine a community where, in times of disaster, those with the means (vehicles, boats, safe spaces) not only ensure their own evacuation but also assist others in need. This support wouldn’t just be voluntary; there would be incentives—things like tax breaks, gift cards, or community points that could be redeemed for local benefits.

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **If you had resources to help during a disaster (like a truck, extra room, etc.), would incentives motivate you to help others evacuate?**
2. **What types of incentives do you think would encourage people in your community to step up in times of crisis?**
3. **What barriers would prevent you from helping others in a disaster situation?**
4. **What’s one thing you think your community could do better to be prepared for an emergency?**

Your feedback could help shape a new solution that empowers communities to be more resilient in the face of climate challenges. If you have personal stories, ideas, or thoughts on the incentives system, please drop a comment below!

1701,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, downpour, hate",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.

I've been so focused on my disgust of DeSantis and the policy makers here, the school board in Sarasota where my children go to school and so on that I've stopped taking time to appreciate some of the special things about Florida that I love.  So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

I (22M) stayed in the beautiful city of Melbourne last year for 3 months for a summer engineering internship, and by the end, I wanted to move there

Im finishing 3 months this year in Silicon Valley for another internship.

I have to know, what is with all the hatred on this sub? Some of the common points I see when people are hating on Fl are 1) cost of living, 2) weather, 3) insurance companies leaving.

.....do you people realize all these things are like 10x worse in California?

cost of living, forget about it, insurance, forget about it, weather? how many years have these wildfires been happening?

For christs sake, you people have NO INCOME TAX!!!! Only a handful of states in the US have this privilege, and florida is the only one with good beaches. No income tax, wonderful destinations, plenty of jobs, yall have alot to be grateful for.  Id KILL for no income tax, thats literally a gift from god. Most people have to fight tooth and nail to evade taxes, but your government just hands it to you on a silver platter. Ive lived in florida, and ive lived in the sapphire blue toilet bowl on the other side of the country, trust me, Id take FL any day.

Im not trying to paint this as a left or right thing, I identify as socially left and economically right, so I am  not taking a side here. but seriously yall need to appreciate what you have that us in other states (CA, NC,SC) dont have at all.

I understand some of yall dont like desantis and dont like his social policy, fair enough (although that new alimony law should have won some of you socially left people over, alimony is a patriarchal construct in the first place)

but come on, what NON-SOCIAL (I repeat, NON-SOCIAL) policies do you have or not have in florida that you think california does better? as someone whos lived in both, Im genuinely curious

I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating.

1715,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, downpour, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

1716,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, downpour, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06

Florida is essentially developed swampland, sure but Florida has a desirable climate, low taxes, and lots of corporations are moving here. Home prices here have gone up FASTER than the average ever since the invention of home air conditioning, florida has always had more inflow for most of y’all’s lives, for a reason.

I own a cabin in Anchorage AK, I bought it to fish, and avoid paying taxes on a work bonus. I’d kill myself if I had to live there. Believe it or not, but most people don’t like the cold. Most of the land area in the US gets pretty cold(below freezing lows for at least 1/3 of the year) and people are free to spend their money and move wherever they want.

Supply and demand forces are at play, many of us who are not homeowners may never own a home here, it sucks BIG, but that’s how it works. Same shit happened in Hawaii, bulldozed native homes to build ostentatious beachfront homes, LA, San Diego, Phoenix, Arizona, you think you’re special?. That’s just the name of game, jit. That’s how capitalism works. Prices don’t go up because it sucks living here. The brutal winters in NYC sucked asshole. The summer “nights” at the cabin suck asshole.

Every place with a appealing climate is gonna get rocked with not affordable CoL, that’s how it works, that’s how it has worked and it’s how it will always work.

Don’t have a gripe because people want to live in a nicer place, with nicer weather, with nicer tax treatment. That’s petty, makes you look childish.

If you’re dead set on hating someone because you’ll never own a home here, hate Airbnb, OpenDoor, and Zillow, don’t hate people because they see an opportunity to live a better life, fuck that.

1. Terrible housing market (the low end for houses is $1M)
2. High Income Taxes
3. Terrible weather - hate the winter

While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous.

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy.

I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy.

1726,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, downpour, enjoy",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating.

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19
1755,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, downpour, happy",Born and raised in SWFL…I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I’ve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could’ve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing “real”.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I’ve still never been in active snowfall and haven’t touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I’m not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I’ll be very happy. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I’m going to UCF in August and I’m thrilled for that. Miami isn’t my type though. 

As a young adult now I’ve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I’ve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I’ve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, “Oh no, Im here again.” 

The point of this post isn’t to air my grievances and complain. I know that’s all I’ve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I’m curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree…why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone’s preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I’m up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like…well, like home. I’ve never felt that way about FL.
 
I’m curious what you all have to say.",2024-06-12 14:37:32

1757,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, downpour, happy",Happy Hurricane Season!,"Hurricane season starts June 1, and this one will be a doozy.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03
1758,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, downpour, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US – all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07

1760,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, downpour, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‘Dial *FHP for emergency’.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‘soon’.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it’s not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can’t see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‘escorting’ a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‘wide load’ sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm…) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while…. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, “Now that you’ve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?”  The response: “Sir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.” I’ll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy’s awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don’t need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‘fund raiser mode’, but the time I actually need one?

1761,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, downpour, happy","Insurance company tried to screw me out of collision because of a new state inspection law, anyone experience this?","So apparently The Woke Warrior received a bunch of money from insurance companies through his Super PACs and reinstated a state inspection law for car insurance that went away in 1981.   


I totalled my car about a week ago in the torrential downpour we had. Called my insurance company (Connect, offered by Costco and owned by American Family) and they said they dropped me over a week ago because I didn't get my state inspection.  Ends up they were emailing the wrong email address with info about this and also had my last name spelled wrong on physical mail.  So, they basically told me they're not paying out for my $50-60K car.  


So this law also says that if you've had insurance for 2+ years straight or it's a new car, you do not have to get the state inspection. They knew that and still refused to reinstate my insurance. Finally I tell them if they don't fix this I am going to get legal involved. The next day, they contact me asking for some documents and then say they've reinstated my collision.   


So I am happy they're going to follow the law now, but I wonder how many people are screwed by them because they don't investigate the law or hire a lawyer? They knew they shouldn't have dropped my coverage, but did anyways.  I went a week dealing with the stress and emotion of realizing I'm going to be paying for a car for a few years that I don't even have.

1767,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, rainy, love",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01
1772,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, rainy, love",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

1780,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, rainy, love",I need advice on spending the winter season in Florida.,"I'm a personal trainer and I currently live on the east end of long island.  
I work in a phisical therapist office, at the school gym, a private gym, and in home private sessions. I also work for the town recreation department and I instruct a fitness class that I have created. I write for the news paper here as well. I have many certifications in fitness and nutrition. I have been a master trainer for a few years. I started training in 08.

Living here on the east end in the Hamptons is nice. Iv been here most of my life. But the winter season is absolutely devastating. It gets freezing cold for 8 months out of the year. It gets dark at like 3:30 sometimes in the hart of winter. It's lonely, sad and empty. It's awful! Every year I look forward to summer.. and then when the fall comes its very depressing. This past summer has been very chilly and rainy, it's like sumer hasn't even happened. And  ow its getting dark very earlyand cold every morning.. all the plants are dying and and the season is changing. 

If I could spend some time in a warmer climate during the winter!  Omg what a dream come true.. even if it's just a month or two to start. I went to Miami for the weekend last year and loved it there. The energy, the fitness community, the sun and the beach! People everywhere! I was in love! 

So I need advice, or connections or something. I don't know anyone there and don't know my way around.. I know Florida is a big state but I resonate with the southern part I think.  I reached out to a few gyms and they saw my resume and asked me to come in right away for an interview.. only thing is I'm on long Island.  Also as a trainer most of my income comes from private sessions in-home anyway. 

Oh.. living here in the Hamptons I'm able to generate alot of income. However outgo is the same.. meaning my savings isn't exactly ideal. 
So I'd be looking for something affordable. And I wouldn't be able to find a summer rental when I come back. Ill have to keep my lease intact. I pay both rent bills..",2023-08-30 13:23:06

Can anyone elaborate for me?,2023-07-17 17:27:22
1783,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, rainy, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.

1786,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, rainy, enjoy",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

1793,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, rainy, comfortable",Heat film - effective heat reduction on old windows,"For those of us where replacing windows simply isn’t an option financially, or logistically, or because you’re a renter, just wanted to share a small success story on heat film.

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60’s?) single pane windows. I’m still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7° temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, “ewww. 80s? You lizard. 🦎“ ... Lol, the room is around 78° and is a completely uninsulated 1970’s porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I’m thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

I do not care about power outages it is irrelevant. It's back on in a few days or a few hours. Most people fear power outages in Florida due to the extreme temperatures and the inability to find air conditioning in such an occasion. So you are aware the Florida born and raised can wear black sweater and a hoodie outside as I do this everyday. I wore the black hoodie to keep the sunlight off me. Even when I worked outside doing manual labor I kept a sweater on me. At lunch time when you take it off everything feels frigid like you just walked into a 73° house. This all comes from personal experience. If you're not seasoned for heat then you probably shouldn't be in Florida. It takes time for your body to be acclimated to the harsh climate here. What most people would consider suffering humidity we as Floridians don't really even notice it most of the time. Because when you're born in it, that just makes it business as usual. I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone. Democracy dies in the state. Heat makes people only care about what's actually important. So if you're from up North welcome to the Republic.

1803,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, wet, love",Impact Windows and Low-E gains,"Hi all,

  
We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01

The worst part of it is being smacked in the face by humidity when leaving the house or car.  Humidity for me is like nails on a chalkboard.  

I’ve discovered that when I get home from work, If put on my swimming suite and dump buckets of water on my head every 15 minutes, that I can actually work outside.  The part of your brain that gives you misery from
Going drone dry air to wet air is tricked when you get into swimming mode.  So I now work during rainstorms in my swimming suite and evenings just soaking wet working on cars.  It keeps me clean and cool, and I get burned less by engines.  

I’ve also done the same thing with my scooter.  I just dunk myself in water and then I’m ready to ride or wait for a rain storm and just wear my swimming suit everywhere.  Being wet all the time in Florida is key to living here.  You might get some funny looks at the store being soaking wet all the time but who cares.

My fiancé and I are getting married in September, and he really really really wants to honeymoon in Florida. Originally we were going to do Vegas, but we are going there in October for a concert anyway, so he doesn’t wanna “double dip” and wants to go somewhere different. 

I’ve never been outside of the western half of the United States other than Germany, and am very used to mountains and alligator free lakes, and I’ve never seen the ocean. But the part I’m worried about the most is the HUMIDITY and wet heat. My state (Montana) is dry heat. So it’s usually more manageable. 

I am a *large* woman and the whitest of white without being a redhead, so I’m concerned about getting swamp ass (that I already get here in the summer) and being miserable the whole trip. 

And though I am excited about seeing the ocean, I’m also terrified of it and probably wouldn’t want to go more than ankle deep because of sharks lol. (I bet I would look like a real nice fat seal) though my fiancé says he’s gonna convince me lol. 

I’m just wondering where in the state is the prettiest as far as beaches go, but also not completely PACKED with people? And what time of year would be best to go to avoid crazy heat and tons of people? We may not honeymoon directly after the wedding, we may wait till after the new year.

I am a cast member at Disney so I was offered a full time job and made the move. We live at West Bay Village off on 192 and 5 minutes away from animal kingdom. This place seemed perfect until one week into living there, the toilet over flowed while I was at work. Ever since then we’ve had a leaking toilet. We have called maintenance to fix it and they never permanently fix it. We’ve heard they put other tenants up in a hotel fully paid for, for having the same issue, but they had my partner vacuuming up the water in our own apartment after calling maintenance. They just keep caulking the leak and it keeps lifting. The power goes out occasionally, the wifi will be out for days at a time. The grassy areas are loaded with animal feces. Last week there was a sewage leak and there was wet and used toilet paper in the grass for days. In the laundry room, there must have been a leak because ceiling tiles fell out and remain on top of the dryers covered in mold. The pool was demolished in February I believe, we were told it would take 2-3 weeks to fix and after pouring the concrete the pool has not been worked on in three weeks. The elevator works when it wants to and hasn’t passed an inspection since 2020. There is caution tape around the peppery on things that need fixing or are broken yet nothing has been done (the tape was put there in December.) 

It infuriates me to pay rent every month. I hate living here and I just feel like I deserve better.  I feel like no one, not even the property manager cares about the problems I have with this building and if the problems can’t get fixed, I want out and to break my lease. I am a full time chef, so work is stressful enough and coming home to a place where people don’t have pride and leave this place looking a mess has not been good for my stress.

1823,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, wet, enjoy",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03

1837,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, wet, comfortable",Heat film - effective heat reduction on old windows,"For those of us where replacing windows simply isn’t an option financially, or logistically, or because you’re a renter, just wanted to share a small success story on heat film.

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60’s?) single pane windows. I’m still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7° temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, “ewww. 80s? You lizard. 🦎“ ... Lol, the room is around 78° and is a completely uninsulated 1970’s porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I’m thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

1840,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, wet, comfortable",Florida power outages? we don't care!,"Buckle up this ain't short. I am the Florida born and raised. I do not care about power outages it is irrelevant. It's back on in a few days or a few hours. Most people fear power outages in Florida due to the extreme temperatures and the inability to find air conditioning in such an occasion. So you are aware the Florida born and raised can wear black sweater and a hoodie outside as I do this everyday. I wore the black hoodie to keep the sunlight off me. Even when I worked outside doing manual labor I kept a sweater on me. At lunch time when you take it off everything feels frigid like you just walked into a 73° house. This all comes from personal experience. If you're not seasoned for heat then you probably shouldn't be in Florida. It takes time for your body to be acclimated to the harsh climate here. What most people would consider suffering humidity we as Floridians don't really even notice it most of the time. Because when you're born in it, that just makes it business as usual. I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone. Democracy dies in the state. Heat makes people only care about what's actually important. So if you're from up North welcome to the Republic.

1841,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, rain, love",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

I retract my “It does not make it easier to see you” comment, touché it does make it easier to see, however, I still think it’s a terrible idea and can cause confusion in an already hazardous situation. It’s not advisable by experts. 

Florida made it legal is 2021 to drive with hazards on roads 55mph in unsafe driving conditions, just because it’s a law here, doesn’t mean it’s best practice.

I love the questions of “why does this bother you” cause it was a Sunday night and I felt like addressing something trivial in the grand scheme of things but also unsafe.

Nice to see some justice in our country again and helping me look at the better side of things.  I've been so focused on my disgust of DeSantis and the policy makers here, the school board in Sarasota where my children go to school and so on that I've stopped taking time to appreciate some of the special things about Florida that I love.  So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home.

this company comes quarterly but i havent let them spray in the house for at least a year, nor inside the caged pool patio where the cats hang out. they do spray around the outside of the house and in the garage. 

so - recently ive been finding tiny ants in my primary bathroom and theyre starting to branch out, as im finding little dead ones elsewhere. 

i adopted two cats last fall. one is ~four years old and the other is eight months. the adult cat doesnt eat things she shouldnt, but the baby excessively sniffs and licks _everything_ like a dog. floors, walls, the other cat’s butt - if it has any smell, he is into it. he also LOVES water and gets in the showers and sinks a lot.

1866,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, rain, love",An Open Letter to Spring Breakers. Come to Iceland. It's Wilder.,"# An Open Letter to Every Drunk Spring Breaker in Miami

By an Iceland-ish Friend

Dear Drunk College Students,

Going to Florida for one wild and crazy week a year makes sense. It is a very pretty place, with its palm trees and beaches and elderly population. You can eat breakfast at any time of the day and sometimes alligators cross the road. 

Do you know what crosses the road in Iceland my dear drunk friends? WILD HORSES and RAINBOWS. I don’t want to be a soggy beach blanket but perhaps it’s time to consider a more exotic destination for Spring Break, somewhere you can really go wild. Iceland baby!

You want to drink until you blackout and wake up with a strange sexy person in a mysterious and sexy place? We do that all the time but we drink Brennivin while lounging nuuude in geothermal jacuzzis and later, after we make love to an attractive person who we have verified we are not related to, we sometimes wake up under the Northern Lights. Vape that, Miami. 

One time, my cousin got me so drunk I browned out, I think that’s what you call it, and I came to on top of an active volcano. And let me tell you, there’s no cure for a hangover like running for your life from red hot lava, if you get my flow, my lava flow?

Doesn’t our country sound like an enchanting place? We don’t even need drugs here because we believe in fairies and frost giants and are home to dozens of rainbows each day. But wait, there’s more! We have ice diamond beaches, geysers, glaciers, the majestic Vestrahorn Mountains, puffin colonies, waterfalls, fermented shark, more waterfalls, Björk, and Black Death drink.

Ok ok, so your friends will all be in Flooorida or something. But according to my readings, Florida is sinking! Dearest drunks, it’s sliding into the ocean. What will happen to you if you’re dancing nudey groovy and suddenly dolphins swim by? Americans are very special but I’m pretty sure you don’t have gills. This is not the Little Mermaid. Stingrays and dolphins will be happy partying in your abandoned underwater South Beach dance clubs while you search for a new submarine condo.

I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to be negative. I take that back. Let’s start over ok? No more end of times talk. 

Don’t you spend enough time with your Spring Break friends already? Aren’t you a teensy weensy bit curious to explore our fascinating Icelandic gene pool? Everyone here is good looking, friendly, and extremely strong. It’s really great! 

If we were a little genetically more diverse I wouldn’t even be writing you this letter. See dear drunks, we have a little problem. Well it’s not a problem so much as it is an annoyance. We are a small country right? Very charming, no? Well, when you’re small, you have a lot more cousins than you think - almost all of us are at least a little bit related. Some smartypants even built an app to help us avoid smooches in the family tree, thanks be to Freyja.

But what would be really super cool would be if you would bring like, a whole lot of sexy American people to Iceland for Spring Break. Maybe you’ll like it and want to stay or we can all fall in love or you know, something. 

So please forget about Miami and Cancun and that beach in Texas and come Spring Break in Iceland. 

P.S. Don’t forget your sunscreen, rain poncho, wool socks, and party pants! See you soon!

The worst part of it is being smacked in the face by humidity when leaving the house or car.  Humidity for me is like nails on a chalkboard.  

I’ve discovered that when I get home from work, If put on my swimming suite and dump buckets of water on my head every 15 minutes, that I can actually work outside.  The part of your brain that gives you misery from
Going drone dry air to wet air is tricked when you get into swimming mode.  So I now work during rainstorms in my swimming suite and evenings just soaking wet working on cars.  It keeps me clean and cool, and I get burned less by engines.  

I’ve also done the same thing with my scooter.  I just dunk myself in water and then I’m ready to ride or wait for a rain storm and just wear my swimming suit everywhere.  Being wet all the time in Florida is key to living here.  You might get some funny looks at the store being soaking wet all the time but who cares.

Nice to see some justice in our country again and helping me look at the better side of things.  I've been so focused on my disgust of DeSantis and the policy makers here, the school board in Sarasota where my children go to school and so on that I've stopped taking time to appreciate some of the special things about Florida that I love.  So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

1883,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, rain, hate",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

1886,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, rain, hate",pesticides inside: are they actually pet safe?,"i use a professional pest control company. they insist their products are pet and child safe as soon as its dry, which they say takes about two hours. 

ive previously asked for an explanation on what happens if the solution gets wet again, whether it be rain or shower moisture or anything else. ive also asked what happens if a cat eats a lizard that been eating bugs. ive never gotten a satisfactory answer - which may just be my own ignorance and paranoia... but it all makes me very nervous. 

i always find dead lizards for a few weeks after they spray outside by the pool. these arent mammals, but theyre not bugs, either. 

this company comes quarterly but i havent let them spray in the house for at least a year, nor inside the caged pool patio where the cats hang out. they do spray around the outside of the house and in the garage. 

so - recently ive been finding tiny ants in my primary bathroom and theyre starting to branch out, as im finding little dead ones elsewhere. 

i adopted two cats last fall. one is ~four years old and the other is eight months. the adult cat doesnt eat things she shouldnt, but the baby excessively sniffs and licks _everything_ like a dog. floors, walls, the other cat’s butt - if it has any smell, he is into it. he also LOVES water and gets in the showers and sinks a lot. 

i hate florida bugs enough that i pay for a pest service but tbh the health of my cats (and me) is more important. 

are pesticides actually safe for people and pets? should i let the company spray inside - or even just in my bathroom - even though my cats love it in there and the baby licks water everywhere he can find it? is there a safer, ant-specific option i should try for now? ",2024-05-08 17:23:43

1891,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, rain, enjoy",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

Does it rain all day every day with cloudy skies or what does it look like?

We plan on mainly visiting beaches, swimming, reading, enjoying the sun, laying by the pool etc. with maybe some day trips to maybe a botanical garden, maybe disney and such. But mainly the beach. We would also like to go on a Caribbean Cruise for one week.

Please give me some advice! I would really like to go to Florida but maybe it's better to visit some other time of year?

1899,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, rain, enjoy",mold-resistance for drywall and other surfaces?,"I moved to a ""crossing"" apartment near the ocean and would like to enjoy the seemingly consistent breezes through the windows during the spring/fall evenings.  But, the outside air humidity typically exceeds 65%.  That, in turn, suffices for rapid mold growth and peeling paint.  So, rather than keep the windows open (still with screens to keep out insects), I follow the universal guidance in this channel: run the dehumidifiers constantly (at relatively high cost, for me) and keep the windows closed.

But, are there any other choices?  Are there any indoor paints, coatings, periodic treatments (spray drywall with Rain-X or other water sealer??), etc. that might improve the mold-resistance of indoor materials to tolerate humidity up to 80% without mold growing on it?

(The building was built around 2006.  Original floors are wood/tile and still look new.  So, AFAIK, the higher risk is the mold peeling the paint and/or invading the walls.)

On one of the threads, someone mentioned that homes ""built earlier than 1940"" were designed with breezes in mind.  Does the ""breeze"" inhibit mold growth?  Or do the <1940 materials inhibit mold growth?

I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05
1919,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, rain, annoying",An Open Letter to Spring Breakers. Come to Iceland. It's Wilder.,"# An Open Letter to Every Drunk Spring Breaker in Miami

By an Iceland-ish Friend

Dear Drunk College Students,

Going to Florida for one wild and crazy week a year makes sense. It is a very pretty place, with its palm trees and beaches and elderly population. You can eat breakfast at any time of the day and sometimes alligators cross the road. 

Do you know what crosses the road in Iceland my dear drunk friends? WILD HORSES and RAINBOWS. I don’t want to be a soggy beach blanket but perhaps it’s time to consider a more exotic destination for Spring Break, somewhere you can really go wild. Iceland baby!

You want to drink until you blackout and wake up with a strange sexy person in a mysterious and sexy place? We do that all the time but we drink Brennivin while lounging nuuude in geothermal jacuzzis and later, after we make love to an attractive person who we have verified we are not related to, we sometimes wake up under the Northern Lights. Vape that, Miami. 

One time, my cousin got me so drunk I browned out, I think that’s what you call it, and I came to on top of an active volcano. And let me tell you, there’s no cure for a hangover like running for your life from red hot lava, if you get my flow, my lava flow?

Doesn’t our country sound like an enchanting place? We don’t even need drugs here because we believe in fairies and frost giants and are home to dozens of rainbows each day. But wait, there’s more! We have ice diamond beaches, geysers, glaciers, the majestic Vestrahorn Mountains, puffin colonies, waterfalls, fermented shark, more waterfalls, Björk, and Black Death drink.

Ok ok, so your friends will all be in Flooorida or something. But according to my readings, Florida is sinking! Dearest drunks, it’s sliding into the ocean. What will happen to you if you’re dancing nudey groovy and suddenly dolphins swim by? Americans are very special but I’m pretty sure you don’t have gills. This is not the Little Mermaid. Stingrays and dolphins will be happy partying in your abandoned underwater South Beach dance clubs while you search for a new submarine condo.

I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to be negative. I take that back. Let’s start over ok? No more end of times talk. 

Don’t you spend enough time with your Spring Break friends already? Aren’t you a teensy weensy bit curious to explore our fascinating Icelandic gene pool? Everyone here is good looking, friendly, and extremely strong. It’s really great! 

If we were a little genetically more diverse I wouldn’t even be writing you this letter. See dear drunks, we have a little problem. Well it’s not a problem so much as it is an annoyance. We are a small country right? Very charming, no? Well, when you’re small, you have a lot more cousins than you think - almost all of us are at least a little bit related. Some smartypants even built an app to help us avoid smooches in the family tree, thanks be to Freyja.

But what would be really super cool would be if you would bring like, a whole lot of sexy American people to Iceland for Spring Break. Maybe you’ll like it and want to stay or we can all fall in love or you know, something. 

So please forget about Miami and Cancun and that beach in Texas and come Spring Break in Iceland. 

P.S. Don’t forget your sunscreen, rain poncho, wool socks, and party pants! See you soon!

\- Your Iceland-ish Friend

But what would be really super cool would be if you would bring like, a whole lot of sexy American people to Iceland for Spring Break. Maybe you’ll like it and want to stay or we can all fall in love or you know, something. 

So please forget about Miami and Cancun and that beach in Texas and come Spring Break in Iceland. 

P.S. Don’t forget your sunscreen, rain poncho, wool socks, and party pants! See you soon!

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February?

We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05
1942,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, rain, annoyed",An Open Letter to Spring Breakers. Come to Iceland. It's Wilder.,"# An Open Letter to Every Drunk Spring Breaker in Miami

By an Iceland-ish Friend

Dear Drunk College Students,

Going to Florida for one wild and crazy week a year makes sense. It is a very pretty place, with its palm trees and beaches and elderly population. You can eat breakfast at any time of the day and sometimes alligators cross the road. 

Do you know what crosses the road in Iceland my dear drunk friends? WILD HORSES and RAINBOWS. I don’t want to be a soggy beach blanket but perhaps it’s time to consider a more exotic destination for Spring Break, somewhere you can really go wild. Iceland baby!

You want to drink until you blackout and wake up with a strange sexy person in a mysterious and sexy place? We do that all the time but we drink Brennivin while lounging nuuude in geothermal jacuzzis and later, after we make love to an attractive person who we have verified we are not related to, we sometimes wake up under the Northern Lights. Vape that, Miami. 

One time, my cousin got me so drunk I browned out, I think that’s what you call it, and I came to on top of an active volcano. And let me tell you, there’s no cure for a hangover like running for your life from red hot lava, if you get my flow, my lava flow?

Doesn’t our country sound like an enchanting place? We don’t even need drugs here because we believe in fairies and frost giants and are home to dozens of rainbows each day. But wait, there’s more! We have ice diamond beaches, geysers, glaciers, the majestic Vestrahorn Mountains, puffin colonies, waterfalls, fermented shark, more waterfalls, Björk, and Black Death drink.

Ok ok, so your friends will all be in Flooorida or something. But according to my readings, Florida is sinking! Dearest drunks, it’s sliding into the ocean. What will happen to you if you’re dancing nudey groovy and suddenly dolphins swim by? Americans are very special but I’m pretty sure you don’t have gills. This is not the Little Mermaid. Stingrays and dolphins will be happy partying in your abandoned underwater South Beach dance clubs while you search for a new submarine condo.

I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to be negative. I take that back. Let’s start over ok? No more end of times talk. 

Don’t you spend enough time with your Spring Break friends already? Aren’t you a teensy weensy bit curious to explore our fascinating Icelandic gene pool? Everyone here is good looking, friendly, and extremely strong. It’s really great! 

If we were a little genetically more diverse I wouldn’t even be writing you this letter. See dear drunks, we have a little problem. Well it’s not a problem so much as it is an annoyance. We are a small country right? Very charming, no? Well, when you’re small, you have a lot more cousins than you think - almost all of us are at least a little bit related. Some smartypants even built an app to help us avoid smooches in the family tree, thanks be to Freyja.

But what would be really super cool would be if you would bring like, a whole lot of sexy American people to Iceland for Spring Break. Maybe you’ll like it and want to stay or we can all fall in love or you know, something. 

So please forget about Miami and Cancun and that beach in Texas and come Spring Break in Iceland.

1952,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, rain, comfortable",Heat film - effective heat reduction on old windows,"For those of us where replacing windows simply isn’t an option financially, or logistically, or because you’re a renter, just wanted to share a small success story on heat film.

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60’s?) single pane windows. I’m still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7° temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, “ewww. 80s? You lizard. 🦎“ ... Lol, the room is around 78° and is a completely uninsulated 1970’s porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I’m thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

1955,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, rain, comfortable",Florida power outages? we don't care!,"Buckle up this ain't short. I am the Florida born and raised. I do not care about power outages it is irrelevant. It's back on in a few days or a few hours. Most people fear power outages in Florida due to the extreme temperatures and the inability to find air conditioning in such an occasion. So you are aware the Florida born and raised can wear black sweater and a hoodie outside as I do this everyday. I wore the black hoodie to keep the sunlight off me. Even when I worked outside doing manual labor I kept a sweater on me. At lunch time when you take it off everything feels frigid like you just walked into a 73° house. This all comes from personal experience. If you're not seasoned for heat then you probably shouldn't be in Florida. It takes time for your body to be acclimated to the harsh climate here. What most people would consider suffering humidity we as Floridians don't really even notice it most of the time. Because when you're born in it, that just makes it business as usual. I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone. Democracy dies in the state. Heat makes people only care about what's actually important. So if you're from up North welcome to the Republic.

1962,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, storm, love",Californian visiting Florida for the “first time” and it was… great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I’m not moving to Florida. I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

Obviously going into October would be better, but also more expensive. I've been towards the end of November before, but due to costs September is currently the best option.

I live in the UK and today is 30°c. Which is very hot for us. But we also don't have ac at home. A couple of years ago it reached 40 here and it was unbearable.

Thanks everyone for the info, I think we'll be avoiding September now even if it's significantly cheaper. I don't want us to overheat and the chance of storms doesn't sound very fun.

We don’t live in a flood zone so the onto threat is winds. Apparently we’re getting at least 40 MPH sustained winds and 60 MPH gusts. That wouldn’t be too bad, except we live in a neighborhood with lots of trees and have woods behind our house. And the winds will be pushing the trees towards us.

We’re debating whether to sleep in the bedroom or living room. I’ve put together some pros and cons for both.

**Bedroom**

Pros:

* Will actually be able to sleep
* Has less windows than living room
* Right next to tornado safe room

Cons:

* Faces woods, very much in reach of trees
* Almost died in Irma here due to falling tree

**Living room**

Pros:

* Can’t be hit by any trees
* Easier to see what’s happening from here

Cons:

* Probably won’t sleep at all
* Has more windows
* A bit farther from safe room (only by a few seconds, but those seconds can matter)

What do y‘all think? I feel like the bedroom would be more comfortable since it actually has a bed we can sleep on, but the living room would be safer.

1971,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, storm, love",Impact Windows and Low-E gains,"Hi all,

  
We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01
1972,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, storm, love",Hurricane Prep List.,"1. Charge any device that provides light. Laptops, tablets, cameras, video cameras, and old phones. Old cell phones can still used for dialing 911. Charge external battery backups. ( Glow sticks also provide light for a few hours. Stand them upright in a glass or jar to make a lantern.)
2. Wash all trash cans, big and small, and fill them with water for flushing toilets. Line outdoor trash cans with trash bags, fill them with water and store them in the garage. Add bleach to sterilize. 
3. Fill every tub and sink with water. Cover sinks with Saran Wrap to keep it from collecting dust. Fill the washing machine and leave the lid up to store water.
4. Fill old empty water bottles and other containers with water and keep them near sinks for washing hands. 
5. Fill every Tupperware with water and store it in the freezer. These will help keep food cold longer and serve as a backup water supply. 
6. Fill drinking cups with water and cover with Saran Wrap. Store as many as possible in the fridge. You can store the rest on the counter and use it before opening any water bottles. Ice is impossible to find after the storm.
7. Reserve fridge space for storing tap water and keep the sealed water bottles on the counter. 
8. Cook any meats in advance and other perishable foods. You can freeze cooked food. Hard boil eggs for snacks for the first day without power. 
9. Be well hydrated before the storm hits and avoid salty foods that make you dehydrated. 
10. Wash all dirty clothes and bed sheets. Anything dirty will smell without the A/C, you may need the items, and with no A/C, you'll be sweating a lot. You're going to want clean sheets. 
11. Toss out any expired food, clean cat litter boxes, and empty all trash cans in the house, including bathrooms. Remove anything that will cause an odor when the A/C is off. If you don't have a trash day pickup before the storm, find a dumpster. 
12. Bring in any yard decor, secure anything that will fly around, secure gates, bring in hoses, potted plants, etc. Bring in patio furniture and grills. 
13. Clean your environment so you have clear, easy escape routes. Even if that means temporarily moving furniture to one area. 
14. Scrub all bathrooms so you are starting with a clean odor-free environment. Store water-filled trash cans next to each toilet for flushing. 
15. Place everything you own that is important and necessary in a backpack or small file box that is easy to grab. Include your wallet with ID, phone, hand sanitizer, snacks, etc. Get plastic sleeves for important documents.
16. Make sure you have cash on hand.
17. Stock up on pet food and fill up bowls of water for pets. 
18. Refill any medications. Most insurance companies allow for 2 emergency refills per year.
19. Fill your propane tanks. You can heat soup cans, boil water, make coffee, and other stuff besides just grilling meat. Get an extra, if possible.
20. Drop your A/C in advance and lower temperatures in your fridges. 
21. Gather all candles, flashlights, lighters, matches, batteries, and other items and keep them accessible. 
22. Clean all counters in advance. Start with a clean surface. Buy Clorox Wipes for cleaning when there is no power. Mop your floors and vacuum. If power is out for 10 days, you'll have to live in the mess you started with. 
23. Pick your emergency safe place such as a closet under the stairs. Store the items you'll need in that location for the brunt of the storm. Make a hand fan for when the power is out. 
24. Shower just before the storm is scheduled to hit. 
25. Keep baby wipes next to each toilet. Don't flush them. It's not the time to risk clogging your toilet!
26. Run your dishwasher, don't risk having dirty smelly dishes and you need every container for water! Remember you'll need clean water for brushing your teeth, washing yourself, and cleaning your hands. 
27. Put a small suitcase in your car in case you decide to evacuate. Also, put at least one jug of water in your car. It will still be there if you don't evacuate!  Remember to pack for pets as well. 
28. Check on all family members, set up emergency backup plans, and check on elderly neighbors. 
29. Remember, pets are family too. Take them with you!
30. Before the storm, unplug all electronics. There will be power surges during and after the storm.
31. Gas up your car and have a spare gas container for your generator or your car when you run out.
32 . Use plastic cups and paper plates. 👍  You need water to wash dishes....👎
33 . Also if you run out of water tap your hot water heater it can have up to 30 gallons stored in there.
34 . Put water in balloons and store it in the freezer.
35 . If it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown Flush it down!💩
If you can, take a video of your house and contents....walk room to room--open cabinets/drawers and closets.  This will help if you need to make a claim later.  It will show proof of items and help you list all the items (help your memory, so you don't forget anything)...I highly recommend it!!!
I also heard you should freeze a cup of water, and place a coin on top after it is frozen...keep this in your freezer to help you gauge the temperature if the power goes out.  If the coin stays on top, the food is staying frozen.  If the coin falls into the water, the freezer thawed out and most food will likely need to be thrown away.  This is super helpful is you have to leave and come back, as it may appear everything is still frozen, but if the coin is in the cup--you will know!!",2024-10-09 14:45:24

You can't go two blocks without seeing a house being torn down, rebuilt, condo's going up, etc. If you drive through Grant-Valkyria, you'll see housing developments going up literally as far as the horizon goes. People are drowning in economic opportunity over here. Well.. wealthy people and business owners are anyway. It'll trickle down right? /s

You've all seen the stats - rent, insurance, living expenses are going up. Welcome to the rat race. Moving to FL, my health insurance went DOWN 58%, my go-to bottle of whiskey is $2 less, my car insurance went down $30 for 6 a months premium, groceries have dropped dramatically (mostly because Walmart is magnitudes nicer in FL and the local/organic scene is stronger here too) and I'm renting a house for $2,000 that would be about $3,000 back home. I know.. I'm sorry.. I'm part of the gentrification, but the ""too high"" prices here are a gift for this northerner and you're damn right I'd be okay paying more than I am. But I think it's something people need to hear - Florida is gentrifying and her economy is exploding since Covid. It's catching up to the competition level that exists in ""BosWash"" and the reason is obvious: people from BosWash are still moving to Florida in droves. [Florida is still growing.](https://www.businessinsider.com/people-moving-out-of-florida-in-2021-2023-7)

[Climate Gentrification](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/florida-hurricanes-housing-gentrification#:~:text=Florida%20neighborhoods%20hit%20by%20hurricanes,storm%2C%20a%20new%20study%20reveals) is exacerbating the ""unaffordable"" markets too.

My anecdotal experience: when I was at the DMV transferring my registration, I was sitting with a Californian emigrant. When I went to the park in my new home town, the teenagers were wearing ""say gay"" shirts. White men are a minority (in my town) and I'm LOVING it (hard to cite since Latino isn't on the census). The biggest selling factor for me moving to FL was that I can't really afford a house back in the Delaware Valley. I'm 28 and not very wealthy. I *can* afford a house in just about every market in FL.

So whose leaving Florida? Mostly Florida natives and other groups who aren't used to competing in urban economies. Where are they going? [Not to the cities](https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/15c0fau/whos_moving_out_of_florida/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) if you ask them. They're heading to areas of lesser economic development/lower competition/lower living expenses. 

Florida is a beautiful land of opportunity. I'm here to fight, I won't be missing a single vote. I brought my blue collar small business with me, and I'll be raising my family here too. The way I see it, I'm ""part of the problem"" if you're leaving because of the economy. But that makes me part of the political solution: a modern Florida, the fourth largest economy in our country, whose [GDP is growing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_GDP) at 11% YoY, placing it squarely on the ""growing faster than average"" side of the bell curve.

1. The stairs leading up to the second floor rooms are shaky and you have to use the handrails to not fall.  However, the handrails have broken and chipped paint that hurt your hands and are rusting.  Even the property manager told us she doesn't like going up and down those stairs.

2.  The drain in the hot tub looks like it spent the last 20 years under water on a ship wreck.  It was so rusted, we did not feel comfortable using it.

3.  The swimming pool and the heated mineral pool were filthy.  We actually used the skimmer to try to clean the mineral pool ourselves, but once we got in, we saw all the scum on the tiles and quickly got out.

4.  The towels were stained and had large rips.

5.  The wifi and TV service never worked the entire time we were there.

6.  Our plans changed and we needed to leave a day early.  I talked to the property manager and she said she would change the reservation and refund us what we had paid for the last night of the stay that we wouldn't be using.  We left by 10am that morning so they had plenty of time to clean the room and prepare it for someone else.  It turned out that she lied and never gave us the refund.  When we complained afterwards through Expedia's customer service, they tried contacting the property but could not get approval for the refund so we ended up paying over $300 for a night in a room we didn't use even after being assured that wouldn't happen.

7.  The nice and quiet atmosphere is now ruined by a bar that is directly adjacent to the property.  Our room was on the opposite side of the property but we still could hear the customers and the music through the walls until after 2am each night.

8.  One of the ""features"" they mention is that you are within view of the historical Flagler Beach pier.  They don't mention it was badly damaged in a storm over 2 years ago and has not been repaired and is just boarded up.  The last section of it looks like it will fall into the ocean anytime now.

9.  One of the two mornings we were there, we came down for breakfast and were told that the cook just didn't show up that day so our bed and breakfast had no breakfast but no compensation was offered for this.10.  The waitress was telling us private stuff about other staff members like a cracked skull during a fight with her boyfriend.  That isn't the story you want to hear on your romantic anniversary trip and should have been told to the police instead or out of town customers.

Overall, this place is poorly managed, not maintained and way overpriced for what you are getting.  I highly recommend avoiding it and if you have reservations already, cancel them and then monitor your credit card to make sure they don't charge you anyway.",2024-04-12 13:42:02

So yeah, the purpose of insurance is to transfer risk of loss to then pool said risk into larger groups. This risk is calculated, then priced for, by combining the size of the loss with the probability of it happening. This may seem weirdly academic, but it is important to understand this. Insurance companies charge premiums both to make a profit and to pool funds to eventually compensate homeowners. Whether private/public or with a profit motive or without, this is how insurance works. You pay money to transfer your risk of loss to another entity that if that loss occurred can absorb said loss.

Unfortunately, Climate change is eventually going to mean that no sane business will have any desire to accept this transference of risk without a massive increase in premiums. Our poor stewardship of the earth over the last century means that the risk of loss we face as Florida homeowners has and will continue to increase. As both the size of the loss (huge mcmansions around every corner) and probability of the loss due to climate change continues to increase, premium increases are inevitable. No insurance entity is stupid, they pay people a lot of money to calculate the increased risks of bigger and more frequent storms. The premium increases reflect a reality of the world, not (just) corporate greed (but lets be real where there is corps there is greed, but this doesn't change the economic realities that underlay the practice of offering insurance).

Socializing the risk through public insurance does nothing to actually decrease the risk, which will still need to be paid for, just publicly and collectively. If you cut all the profits out of the system, we're not going to see the same rates we saw 20 or even 10 years ago, even accounting for inflation. A more robust public option (which I favor) can't fix this, and will naturally result in higher taxes in some form, be it sales taxes, property taxes or a dreaded state income tax. The risk has gone up. Everyone can see that, this is going to cost more no matter how we structure it.

Good stewardship from governmental entities (lol lmao even) could ease the pain and make this a more orderly transition (into oblivion....), but beyond that there is no putting the genie back in the bottle. The storm gods are angrier then ever, coming for our homes and if we want to made whole for those losses, it's gonna cost all us a lot more money to do.

So yeah, maybe it is time to pack up, sell the home and move out. Personally, I'll be renting for the rest of my life in Florida. If the rents get too high due to bleed through costs, well I can cut and run for greener pastures a lot easier. I'll still lose money, but at least I won't have to try and convince some poor schmuck to take the ticking time bomb that is Florida homeownership out of my hands. There is no fixing this. This problem is bigger than just our state.

We're stuck in a vortex of corp greed, bad governance and economic realities that won't change even if we fix the first two. This ships going down or at least costing a lot more to fix. Brush up on your ""Nearer, My God, to Thee"", because the good times are gone, the okay times are here and you don't even wanna know about the bad times.

2002,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, storm, hate",Hurricane Prep List.,"1. Charge any device that provides light. Laptops, tablets, cameras, video cameras, and old phones. Old cell phones can still used for dialing 911. Charge external battery backups. ( Glow sticks also provide light for a few hours. Stand them upright in a glass or jar to make a lantern.)
2. Wash all trash cans, big and small, and fill them with water for flushing toilets. Line outdoor trash cans with trash bags, fill them with water and store them in the garage. Add bleach to sterilize. 
3. Fill every tub and sink with water. Cover sinks with Saran Wrap to keep it from collecting dust. Fill the washing machine and leave the lid up to store water.
4. Fill old empty water bottles and other containers with water and keep them near sinks for washing hands. 
5. Fill every Tupperware with water and store it in the freezer. These will help keep food cold longer and serve as a backup water supply. 
6. Fill drinking cups with water and cover with Saran Wrap. Store as many as possible in the fridge. You can store the rest on the counter and use it before opening any water bottles. Ice is impossible to find after the storm.
7. Reserve fridge space for storing tap water and keep the sealed water bottles on the counter. 
8. Cook any meats in advance and other perishable foods. You can freeze cooked food. Hard boil eggs for snacks for the first day without power. 
9. Be well hydrated before the storm hits and avoid salty foods that make you dehydrated. 
10. Wash all dirty clothes and bed sheets. Anything dirty will smell without the A/C, you may need the items, and with no A/C, you'll be sweating a lot. You're going to want clean sheets. 
11. Toss out any expired food, clean cat litter boxes, and empty all trash cans in the house, including bathrooms. Remove anything that will cause an odor when the A/C is off. If you don't have a trash day pickup before the storm, find a dumpster. 
12. Bring in any yard decor, secure anything that will fly around, secure gates, bring in hoses, potted plants, etc. Bring in patio furniture and grills. 
13. Clean your environment so you have clear, easy escape routes. Even if that means temporarily moving furniture to one area. 
14. Scrub all bathrooms so you are starting with a clean odor-free environment. Store water-filled trash cans next to each toilet for flushing. 
15. Place everything you own that is important and necessary in a backpack or small file box that is easy to grab. Include your wallet with ID, phone, hand sanitizer, snacks, etc. Get plastic sleeves for important documents.
16. Make sure you have cash on hand.
17. Stock up on pet food and fill up bowls of water for pets. 
18. Refill any medications. Most insurance companies allow for 2 emergency refills per year.
19. Fill your propane tanks. You can heat soup cans, boil water, make coffee, and other stuff besides just grilling meat. Get an extra, if possible.
20. Drop your A/C in advance and lower temperatures in your fridges. 
21. Gather all candles, flashlights, lighters, matches, batteries, and other items and keep them accessible. 
22. Clean all counters in advance. Start with a clean surface. Buy Clorox Wipes for cleaning when there is no power. Mop your floors and vacuum. If power is out for 10 days, you'll have to live in the mess you started with. 
23. Pick your emergency safe place such as a closet under the stairs. Store the items you'll need in that location for the brunt of the storm. Make a hand fan for when the power is out. 
24. Shower just before the storm is scheduled to hit. 
25. Keep baby wipes next to each toilet. Don't flush them. It's not the time to risk clogging your toilet!
26. Run your dishwasher, don't risk having dirty smelly dishes and you need every container for water! Remember you'll need clean water for brushing your teeth, washing yourself, and cleaning your hands. 
27. Put a small suitcase in your car in case you decide to evacuate. Also, put at least one jug of water in your car. It will still be there if you don't evacuate!  Remember to pack for pets as well. 
28. Check on all family members, set up emergency backup plans, and check on elderly neighbors. 
29. Remember, pets are family too. Take them with you!
30. Before the storm, unplug all electronics. There will be power surges during and after the storm.
31. Gas up your car and have a spare gas container for your generator or your car when you run out.
32 . Use plastic cups and paper plates. 👍  You need water to wash dishes....👎
33 . Also if you run out of water tap your hot water heater it can have up to 30 gallons stored in there.
34 . Put water in balloons and store it in the freezer.
35 . If it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown Flush it down!💩
If you can, take a video of your house and contents....walk room to room--open cabinets/drawers and closets.  This will help if you need to make a claim later.  It will show proof of items and help you list all the items (help your memory, so you don't forget anything)...I highly recommend it!!!
I also heard you should freeze a cup of water, and place a coin on top after it is frozen...keep this in your freezer to help you gauge the temperature if the power goes out.  If the coin stays on top, the food is staying frozen.  If the coin falls into the water, the freezer thawed out and most food will likely need to be thrown away.  This is super helpful is you have to leave and come back, as it may appear everything is still frozen, but if the coin is in the cup--you will know!!",2024-10-09 14:45:24

I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

8. Cook any meats in advance and other perishable foods. You can freeze cooked food. Hard boil eggs for snacks for the first day without power. 
9. Be well hydrated before the storm hits and avoid salty foods that make you dehydrated. 
10. Wash all dirty clothes and bed sheets. Anything dirty will smell without the A/C, you may need the items, and with no A/C, you'll be sweating a lot. You're going to want clean sheets. 
11. Toss out any expired food, clean cat litter boxes, and empty all trash cans in the house, including bathrooms. Remove anything that will cause an odor when the A/C is off. If you don't have a trash day pickup before the storm, find a dumpster. 
12. Bring in any yard decor, secure anything that will fly around, secure gates, bring in hoses, potted plants, etc. Bring in patio furniture and grills. 
13. Clean your environment so you have clear, easy escape routes. Even if that means temporarily moving furniture to one area. 
14. Scrub all bathrooms so you are starting with a clean odor-free environment. Store water-filled trash cans next to each toilet for flushing. 
15. Place everything you own that is important and necessary in a backpack or small file box that is easy to grab. Include your wallet with ID, phone, hand sanitizer, snacks, etc. Get plastic sleeves for important documents.
16. Make sure you have cash on hand.
17. Stock up on pet food and fill up bowls of water for pets. 
18. Refill any medications. Most insurance companies allow for 2 emergency refills per year.
19. Fill your propane tanks. You can heat soup cans, boil water, make coffee, and other stuff besides just grilling meat. Get an extra, if possible.
20. Drop your A/C in advance and lower temperatures in your fridges. 
21. Gather all candles, flashlights, lighters, matches, batteries, and other items and keep them accessible. 
22. Clean all counters in advance. Start with a clean surface. Buy Clorox Wipes for cleaning when there is no power. Mop your floors and vacuum. If power is out for 10 days, you'll have to live in the mess you started with. 
23. Pick your emergency safe place such as a closet under the stairs. Store the items you'll need in that location for the brunt of the storm. Make a hand fan for when the power is out. 
24. Shower just before the storm is scheduled to hit. 
25. Keep baby wipes next to each toilet. Don't flush them. It's not the time to risk clogging your toilet!
26. Run your dishwasher, don't risk having dirty smelly dishes and you need every container for water! Remember you'll need clean water for brushing your teeth, washing yourself, and cleaning your hands. 
27. Put a small suitcase in your car in case you decide to evacuate. Also, put at least one jug of water in your car. It will still be there if you don't evacuate!  Remember to pack for pets as well. 
28. Check on all family members, set up emergency backup plans, and check on elderly neighbors. 
29. Remember, pets are family too. Take them with you!
30. Before the storm, unplug all electronics. There will be power surges during and after the storm.
31. Gas up your car and have a spare gas container for your generator or your car when you run out.
32 . Use plastic cups and paper plates. 👍  You need water to wash dishes....👎
33 . Also if you run out of water tap your hot water heater it can have up to 30 gallons stored in there.
34 . Put water in balloons and store it in the freezer.
35 . If it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown Flush it down!💩
If you can, take a video of your house and contents....walk room to room--open cabinets/drawers and closets.  This will help if you need to make a claim later.  It will show proof of items and help you list all the items (help your memory, so you don't forget anything)...I highly recommend it!!!
I also heard you should freeze a cup of water, and place a coin on top after it is frozen...keep this in your freezer to help you gauge the temperature if the power goes out.  If the coin stays on top, the food is staying frozen.  If the coin falls into the water, the freezer thawed out and most food will likely need to be thrown away.  This is super helpful is you have to leave and come back, as it may appear everything is still frozen, but if the coin is in the cup--you will know!!",2024-10-09 14:45:24

We don't drink, smoke or do any drugs. We don't like bars (even barcades due to the smell of dust and alcohol). My partner is willing to drive most anywhere in Central Florida so the location usually isn't an issue. Due to my severe asthma hiking and large exertion is normally not possible. We have been to some springs and a few music events. I like going to places with foodcarts and music and merchants but most of them are early in the morning and we are nightshift workers. We normally get  up around 2pm and are up until around 6:30 am. Noon would be pushing it. 

Things we are into:

We are gamer nerds

We enjoy the beach when it's not storming...which seems to be everyday lately. 

We love anime

We like live music!

I’m just not sure anymore. My husband NEVER wants to leave, and I find sitting through a Cat 5 hurricane inside a boarded up house extremely anxiety producing.

2023,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, storm, happy",My husband and I lived through our first tornado,"Around 5 PM the day of the hurricane, 3 or so hours before the storm was supposed to affect us at all, my husband and I lived through our first tornado. Just minutes after being outside finishing putting up makeshift shutters and putting things away that could go flying in the hurricane.
I said ""Babe, we've had a long day preparing and neither of us have eaten any food. We REALLY need to go inside"" I said it with some urgency, and even felt that it was important we go inside and rest.
We sat down inside, I took one bite of my food. Then I felt an urge to pray. I put down my food and prayed out loud with my husband for God's protection in the path of this storm and that He would keep us and those in it's path safe. I thanked God for our home and all of our blessings.
A minute or two later, I got a tornado warning on my phone... And all of the sudden, very quickly, the whole trailer (yes, trailer!) is shaking violently, and through one of the windows with unfinished makeshift ""shutters"", I saw it pass through our yard. I screamed at the top of my lungs to my husband to get under something! ""ITS A F^$&@<$ TORNADO, GET DOWN"" I yelled. Minutes before this my mom had been texting me urgently about tornadoes cropping up all over our county. She kept warning me. She said to get a helmet if I hear a train. When the tornado hit, I dove under my heavy desk with my helmet on and waited in the fetal position until I thought it was gone.
And once it had passed, my husband and I went outside to survey the damage...
Almost every tree around our property has been downed. For the record, we basically live in a little rainforest. We used to not be able to see into amy of our neighbor's yards.
One tree fell into the roof but didn't do any major damage. Our plants are all destroyed, backyard has been just torn and shredded to pieces. This tornado ripped stuff up like it was nothing. Meanwhile, in our shanty little trailer, fortified only with shutters we literally made out of garbage we had, my husband and I are perfectly fine. At this point we are both totally in shock.
We decided very quickly to put all of our most valuable possessions together and leave before the actual hurricane hit. Thankfully my brother-in-law and his wife are so hospitable and welcomed us right in.
If all of my things got destroyed but my husband and I are still alive, I'm happy. The tornado was so unexpected and came before the storm was even here. I believe the timing of us going inside and taking cover had to be God's timing. We are so thankful for God's protection and we have plans to help our community and the surrounding communities in the aftermath of this monster of a storm.  Others near us were not nearly so lucky. People died in cities all around us. It's so so tragic. Brick homes were taken out by tornadoes in neighborhoods near us. Many people died. Please pray for the families affected by this awful tragedy, and also those still recovering from Hurricane Helene and now dealing with more trouble from Milton. Farther North people had to be evacuated. I have no clue how North Florida is but I can not imagine. I have full plans to go out and do as much disaster relief as possible. A week ago before we knew about Milton, I was passing out flyers trying to get people to donate supplies to Helene's victims. It's all so scary.
Thank you for your thoughts and prayers. So many weren't so lucky as us yesterday and it's not all over yet.
Praying for those who lost homes or worse, family... God bless these people. Thanking God for his provision and timing today.",2024-10-12 13:57:42

2028,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, storm, happy",Happy Hurricane Season!,"Hurricane season starts June 1, and this one will be a doozy.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03

Old cell phones can still used for dialing 911. Charge external battery backups. ( Glow sticks also provide light for a few hours. Stand them upright in a glass or jar to make a lantern.)
2. Wash all trash cans, big and small, and fill them with water for flushing toilets. Line outdoor trash cans with trash bags, fill them with water and store them in the garage. Add bleach to sterilize. 
3. Fill every tub and sink with water. Cover sinks with Saran Wrap to keep it from collecting dust. Fill the washing machine and leave the lid up to store water.
4. Fill old empty water bottles and other containers with water and keep them near sinks for washing hands. 
5. Fill every Tupperware with water and store it in the freezer. These will help keep food cold longer and serve as a backup water supply. 
6. Fill drinking cups with water and cover with Saran Wrap. Store as many as possible in the fridge. You can store the rest on the counter and use it before opening any water bottles. Ice is impossible to find after the storm.
7. Reserve fridge space for storing tap water and keep the sealed water bottles on the counter. 
8. Cook any meats in advance and other perishable foods. You can freeze cooked food. Hard boil eggs for snacks for the first day without power. 
9. Be well hydrated before the storm hits and avoid salty foods that make you dehydrated. 
10. Wash all dirty clothes and bed sheets. Anything dirty will smell without the A/C, you may need the items, and with no A/C, you'll be sweating a lot. You're going to want clean sheets. 
11. Toss out any expired food, clean cat litter boxes, and empty all trash cans in the house, including bathrooms. Remove anything that will cause an odor when the A/C is off. If you don't have a trash day pickup before the storm, find a dumpster. 
12. Bring in any yard decor, secure anything that will fly around, secure gates, bring in hoses, potted plants, etc. Bring in patio furniture and grills. 
13. Clean your environment so you have clear, easy escape routes. Even if that means temporarily moving furniture to one area. 
14. Scrub all bathrooms so you are starting with a clean odor-free environment. Store water-filled trash cans next to each toilet for flushing. 
15. Place everything you own that is important and necessary in a backpack or small file box that is easy to grab. Include your wallet with ID, phone, hand sanitizer, snacks, etc. Get plastic sleeves for important documents.
16. Make sure you have cash on hand.
17. Stock up on pet food and fill up bowls of water for pets. 
18. Refill any medications. Most insurance companies allow for 2 emergency refills per year.
19. Fill your propane tanks. You can heat soup cans, boil water, make coffee, and other stuff besides just grilling meat. Get an extra, if possible.
20. Drop your A/C in advance and lower temperatures in your fridges. 
21. Gather all candles, flashlights, lighters, matches, batteries, and other items and keep them accessible. 
22. Clean all counters in advance. Start with a clean surface. Buy Clorox Wipes for cleaning when there is no power. Mop your floors and vacuum. If power is out for 10 days, you'll have to live in the mess you started with. 
23. Pick your emergency safe place such as a closet under the stairs. Store the items you'll need in that location for the brunt of the storm. Make a hand fan for when the power is out. 
24. Shower just before the storm is scheduled to hit. 
25. Keep baby wipes next to each toilet. Don't flush them. It's not the time to risk clogging your toilet!
26. Run your dishwasher, don't risk having dirty smelly dishes and you need every container for water! Remember you'll need clean water for brushing your teeth, washing yourself, and cleaning your hands. 
27. Put a small suitcase in your car in case you decide to evacuate. Also, put at least one jug of water in your car. It will still be there if you don't evacuate!  Remember to pack for pets as well. 
28. Check on all family members, set up emergency backup plans, and check on elderly neighbors. 
29. Remember, pets are family too. Take them with you!
30. Before the storm, unplug all electronics. There will be power surges during and after the storm.
31. Gas up your car and have a spare gas container for your generator or your car when you run out.
32 . Use plastic cups and paper plates. 👍  You need water to wash dishes....👎
33 . Also if you run out of water tap your hot water heater it can have up to 30 gallons stored in there.
34 . Put water in balloons and store it in the freezer.
35 . If it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown Flush it down!💩
If you can, take a video of your house and contents....walk room to room--open cabinets/drawers and closets.  This will help if you need to make a claim later.  It will show proof of items and help you list all the items (help your memory, so you don't forget anything)...I highly recommend it!!!
I also heard you should freeze a cup of water, and place a coin on top after it is frozen...keep this in your freezer to help you gauge the temperature if the power goes out.  If the coin stays on top, the food is staying frozen.  If the coin falls into the water, the freezer thawed out and most food will likely need to be thrown away.  This is super helpful is you have to leave and come back, as it may appear everything is still frozen, but if the coin is in the cup--you will know!!",2024-10-09 14:45:24

2032,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, storm, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‘Dial *FHP for emergency’.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‘soon’.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it’s not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can’t see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‘escorting’ a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‘wide load’ sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm…) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while…. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, “Now that you’ve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?”  The response: “Sir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.” I’ll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy’s awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don’t need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‘fund raiser mode’, but the time I actually need one?

From what I’ve read online here’s what I’ve gathered about the following places.

Fort Meyers/Naples - Still recovering from the hurricane and a lot of beaches are still closed. Likely not a great time to visit. Also red tide is in the area?

Tampa - This seems to have dodged the worst of the storm but I see red tide has been affecting area recently. Are places like Clearwater/Indian Rocks Beach likely ok for swimming and hanging out?

Seems like the eastern side of FL is business as usual if I wanted to go there.If anyone has a suggestion of a place to visit for some sun and warmth I’d be happy to take suggestions.",2023-01-13 02:05:05

2037,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, storm, annoyed",Disney in September?,"Hey, I'm looking to go to Disney next year (2025) and their site says that mid September is relatively quiet. I guess that's due to schools opening?

I've seen some people say it's been especially hot these past couple of years over the summer, and I know September is too, but would you say that it would be an okay time and temperature?

Obviously going into October would be better, but also more expensive. I've been towards the end of November before, but due to costs September is currently the best option.

I live in the UK and today is 30°c. Which is very hot for us. But we also don't have ac at home. A couple of years ago it reached 40 here and it was unbearable. 

TIA 

Edit:

Thanks everyone for the info, I think we'll be avoiding September now even if it's significantly cheaper. I don't want us to overheat and the chance of storms doesn't sound very fun.

2040,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, storm, comfortable",The future of Florida,"Does anyone else think about the long-term future for the state? Honestly the heat this summer is beyond anything I have experience and I've lived here my whole life. 


The heat is only getting hotter, summer after summer, which is the trend.

Hurricanes and storms are getting more catastrophic. Each year is playing Russian roulette in terms of what part of the state is getting ""the big one"". 


I live in a coastal city, which is experiencing more frequent flooding of the streets, especially during King tides, which are worse than ever these last few years. 


Property values and rent are out of control. 


Homeowners insurance is laughable right now. How many insurance companies have stopped doing business in the state? How is this sustainable or affordable long term?


The republican leadership in this state is doing NOTHING about any of the following above and essentially are ignoring the big fat elephant in the state. 


Why would any business or person wish to invest in this state long-term knowing that all of these issues are going to get worse if they're not addressed?


I was thinking about buying an investment property here, but I am not comfortable with it, and am looking out of state now.


What does the future for this state hold? I'm thinking in 20-40 years, this place is borderline inhabitable. At what point do people realize this and try to get out, before it's too late? And they lose all of their property value?",2023-07-21 14:48:17
2041,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, storm, comfortable",Heat film - effective heat reduction on old windows,"For those of us where replacing windows simply isn’t an option financially, or logistically, or because you’re a renter, just wanted to share a small success story on heat film.

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60’s?) single pane windows. I’m still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7° temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, “ewww. 80s? You lizard. 🦎“ ... Lol, the room is around 78° and is a completely uninsulated 1970’s porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I’m thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

2043,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, storm, comfortable",Which room would be safer?,"Hi, so my NE Florida family is staying at home for the storm. We don’t live in a flood zone so the onto threat is winds. Apparently we’re getting at least 40 MPH sustained winds and 60 MPH gusts. That wouldn’t be too bad, except we live in a neighborhood with lots of trees and have woods behind our house. And the winds will be pushing the trees towards us.

We’re debating whether to sleep in the bedroom or living room. I’ve put together some pros and cons for both.

**Bedroom**

Pros:

* Will actually be able to sleep
* Has less windows than living room
* Right next to tornado safe room

Cons:

* Faces woods, very much in reach of trees
* Almost died in Irma here due to falling tree

**Living room**

Pros:

* Can’t be hit by any trees
* Easier to see what’s happening from here

Cons:

* Probably won’t sleep at all
* Has more windows
* A bit farther from safe room (only by a few seconds, but those seconds can matter)

What do y‘all think? I feel like the bedroom would be more comfortable since it actually has a bed we can sleep on, but the living room would be safer.

EDIT: Oh, yeah. I realized another problem with the living room. We have an insane kitten who loves to attack our other cats. So we lock him in the bedroom at night. But if nobody’s in there, we can’t do that. ",2024-10-08 18:37:47

I just moved to Florida (pensacola area) and my partner and I have prepared for Idalia. I’m not asking for help on preparing for the hurricane itself, as i’ve read other threads with great tips already (thanks everyone ☺️) and i know there’s not much more i can physically do, but i do struggle with an anxiety disorder. the situations that usually cause me anxiety are pretty consistent and therefore, i can find a lot of comfort in the familiarity/predictability and can think logically through something anxiety inducing bc it has happened before and has always been okay. fortunately, i’ve never experienced having to prepare for any kind of natural disaster, but it leaves me absolutely lost on how to self soothe now that i know i’ve done all i can and it’s out of my control. i’m especially worried ab having a panic attack once i can start hearing and feeling the storm, all of that over stimulation.  has anyone else struggled with this? what has helped? thank you and stay safe everyone!",2023-08-29 02:37:13
2048,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, storm, comfortable","Golden Magnolia Resort in Flagler Beach, FL - AVOID!","For my wife and my 20th wedding anniversary, I had the bright idea to go back to the bed and breakfast we had stayed at on our honeymoon.  At the time, it was a small, quiet and nice bed and breakfast in Flagler Beach named the White Orchid Inn.  We loved that place.  Since then, it is under new ownership and is now named the Golden Magnolia Resort.  It now sucks and is WAY overpriced.

1. The stairs leading up to the second floor rooms are shaky and you have to use the handrails to not fall.  However, the handrails have broken and chipped paint that hurt your hands and are rusting.  Even the property manager told us she doesn't like going up and down those stairs.

2.  The drain in the hot tub looks like it spent the last 20 years under water on a ship wreck.  It was so rusted, we did not feel comfortable using it.

3.  The swimming pool and the heated mineral pool were filthy.  We actually used the skimmer to try to clean the mineral pool ourselves, but once we got in, we saw all the scum on the tiles and quickly got out.

4.  The towels were stained and had large rips.

5.  The wifi and TV service never worked the entire time we were there.

6.  Our plans changed and we needed to leave a day early.  I talked to the property manager and she said she would change the reservation and refund us what we had paid for the last night of the stay that we wouldn't be using.  We left by 10am that morning so they had plenty of time to clean the room and prepare it for someone else.  It turned out that she lied and never gave us the refund.  When we complained afterwards through Expedia's customer service, they tried contacting the property but could not get approval for the refund so we ended up paying over $300 for a night in a room we didn't use even after being assured that wouldn't happen.

7.  The nice and quiet atmosphere is now ruined by a bar that is directly adjacent to the property.  Our room was on the opposite side of the property but we still could hear the customers and the music through the walls until after 2am each night.

8.  One of the ""features"" they mention is that you are within view of the historical Flagler Beach pier.  They don't mention it was badly damaged in a storm over 2 years ago and has not been repaired and is just boarded up.  The last section of it looks like it will fall into the ocean anytime now.

9.  One of the two mornings we were there, we came down for breakfast and were told that the cook just didn't show up that day so our bed and breakfast had no breakfast but no compensation was offered for this.10.  The waitress was telling us private stuff about other staff members like a cracked skull during a fight with her boyfriend.  That isn't the story you want to hear on your romantic anniversary trip and should have been told to the police instead or out of town customers.

Overall, this place is poorly managed, not maintained and way overpriced for what you are getting.  I highly recommend avoiding it and if you have reservations already, cancel them and then monitor your credit card to make sure they don't charge you anyway.",2024-04-12 13:42:02

I do not care about power outages it is irrelevant. It's back on in a few days or a few hours. Most people fear power outages in Florida due to the extreme temperatures and the inability to find air conditioning in such an occasion. So you are aware the Florida born and raised can wear black sweater and a hoodie outside as I do this everyday. I wore the black hoodie to keep the sunlight off me. Even when I worked outside doing manual labor I kept a sweater on me. At lunch time when you take it off everything feels frigid like you just walked into a 73° house. This all comes from personal experience. If you're not seasoned for heat then you probably shouldn't be in Florida. It takes time for your body to be acclimated to the harsh climate here. What most people would consider suffering humidity we as Floridians don't really even notice it most of the time. Because when you're born in it, that just makes it business as usual. I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone. Democracy dies in the state. Heat makes people only care about what's actually important. So if you're from up North welcome to the Republic.

Wanted to see if anyone on here had recommendations on a general contractor in the area to do some work on my dads condo in Englewood, FL.

Main things that need to be done are ripping up carpet and installing LVP, hanging/finishing drywall in a bedroom affected by the storm (demo is done), painting throughout, and scraping popcorn ceilings/finishing the ceiling afterwards (building is 1982, probably no asbestos but in process of getting it tested). Most of this work would involve moving some furniture around inside the apartment to get it done. Work area is around 1000 sqft.

I realize any trades people are most likely very busy in the aftermath of Ian. My dad is lucky that this is not his full time residence, so he has some flexibility in regards to when work can be done, and preferably when he isn’t here. There’s no huge rush either - would rather wait a bit than going with the next best person.

All that said, I am trying to find him someone that a) does good work and b) is comfortable meeting in person on the project, but then performing the work when my dad is not here, while still being communicative in the process.

I'm from Texas and I totally get the misconceptions that certain states get but I was blown away in Florida. 

I spent a month in FTL then a week in Sarasota and night in Tallahassee. I'd love to spend more time in Tampa and Tallahassee! Tampa seems like a chiller/smaller Dallas on the ocean, with slightly more culture lol. Tallahassee is so incredibly beautiful with all the greenery and live oaks! 

There's so much to do! South Florida has so much access, to the Keys, Everglades, 2 major cruise ports, 3 large airports, amazing beaches, food, I could go on... 

Overall I was impressed with people! Everyone was so nice and chill! The drivers are insane (as they are in Dallas) but I found people were so much more genuinely nice than anticipated. (I blame Miami for the bad rap). 

All the nature and world class beaches really are just so amazing. FTL really has great access to beaches. And while I know the iguanas are invasive, I love lizards and found them fascinating. 

Side note: your summers are a notch down compared to Texas. Yes its hot. Yes it's humid. But at least yall get regular days of clouds or thunderstorms. That's exceedingly rare in Texas. you can't skimp on that sunscreen or hat though! The sun is no joke.

I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them?

It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You’re definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn’t disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there’s way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I’m glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05

We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01

2079,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, thunderstorm, comfortable",Heat film - effective heat reduction on old windows,"For those of us where replacing windows simply isn’t an option financially, or logistically, or because you’re a renter, just wanted to share a small success story on heat film.

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60’s?) single pane windows. I’m still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7° temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, “ewww. 80s? You lizard. 🦎“ ... Lol, the room is around 78° and is a completely uninsulated 1970’s porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I’m thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

Most people fear power outages in Florida due to the extreme temperatures and the inability to find air conditioning in such an occasion. So you are aware the Florida born and raised can wear black sweater and a hoodie outside as I do this everyday. I wore the black hoodie to keep the sunlight off me. Even when I worked outside doing manual labor I kept a sweater on me. At lunch time when you take it off everything feels frigid like you just walked into a 73° house. This all comes from personal experience. If you're not seasoned for heat then you probably shouldn't be in Florida. It takes time for your body to be acclimated to the harsh climate here. What most people would consider suffering humidity we as Floridians don't really even notice it most of the time. Because when you're born in it, that just makes it business as usual. I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone. Democracy dies in the state. Heat makes people only care about what's actually important. So if you're from up North welcome to the Republic.

I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean.

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon.

2085,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, misty, love",Impact Windows and Low-E gains,"Hi all,

  
We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01

2106,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, drizzle, love",Impact Windows and Low-E gains,"Hi all,

  
We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01

I’m not one to contribute to everyone’s nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife’s family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn’t really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What’s that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn’t realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there’s Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you’re living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn’t see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean.

Anyway, I’m glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon.

2121,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, drizzle, comfortable",Heat film - effective heat reduction on old windows,"For those of us where replacing windows simply isn’t an option financially, or logistically, or because you’re a renter, just wanted to share a small success story on heat film.

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60’s?) single pane windows. I’m still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7° temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, “ewww. 80s? You lizard. 🦎“ ... Lol, the room is around 78° and is a completely uninsulated 1970’s porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I’m thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

I do not care about power outages it is irrelevant. It's back on in a few days or a few hours. Most people fear power outages in Florida due to the extreme temperatures and the inability to find air conditioning in such an occasion. So you are aware the Florida born and raised can wear black sweater and a hoodie outside as I do this everyday. I wore the black hoodie to keep the sunlight off me. Even when I worked outside doing manual labor I kept a sweater on me. At lunch time when you take it off everything feels frigid like you just walked into a 73° house. This all comes from personal experience. If you're not seasoned for heat then you probably shouldn't be in Florida. It takes time for your body to be acclimated to the harsh climate here. What most people would consider suffering humidity we as Floridians don't really even notice it most of the time. Because when you're born in it, that just makes it business as usual. I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone. Democracy dies in the state. Heat makes people only care about what's actually important. So if you're from up North welcome to the Republic.

Personally,  I love Florida. Albeit it I'm from totally different state more northern.  The weather is perfect. The temperature is great,  people are nice,  nothing is ""forced"" politics,  or religion. I'm enjoying a lot of the perks here. Housing is decent,  untilies aren't outrageous.

2141,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, downpour, happy","Insurance company tried to screw me out of collision because of a new state inspection law, anyone experience this?","So apparently The Woke Warrior received a bunch of money from insurance companies through his Super PACs and reinstated a state inspection law for car insurance that went away in 1981.   


I totalled my car about a week ago in the torrential downpour we had. Called my insurance company (Connect, offered by Costco and owned by American Family) and they said they dropped me over a week ago because I didn't get my state inspection.  Ends up they were emailing the wrong email address with info about this and also had my last name spelled wrong on physical mail.  So, they basically told me they're not paying out for my $50-60K car.  


So this law also says that if you've had insurance for 2+ years straight or it's a new car, you do not have to get the state inspection. They knew that and still refused to reinstate my insurance. Finally I tell them if they don't fix this I am going to get legal involved. The next day, they contact me asking for some documents and then say they've reinstated my collision.   


So I am happy they're going to follow the law now, but I wonder how many people are screwed by them because they don't investigate the law or hire a lawyer? They knew they shouldn't have dropped my coverage, but did anyways.  I went a week dealing with the stress and emotion of realizing I'm going to be paying for a car for a few years that I don't even have.   


It's really f'd up that insurance companies are legally able to attempt to screw you.",2023-11-30 17:38:18

2143,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, downpour, comfortable",Heat film - effective heat reduction on old windows,"For those of us where replacing windows simply isn’t an option financially, or logistically, or because you’re a renter, just wanted to share a small success story on heat film.

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60’s?) single pane windows. I’m still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7° temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, “ewww. 80s? You lizard. 🦎“ ... Lol, the room is around 78° and is a completely uninsulated 1970’s porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I’m thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

2145,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, downpour, comfortable",Florida power outages? we don't care!,"Buckle up this ain't short. I am the Florida born and raised. I do not care about power outages it is irrelevant. It's back on in a few days or a few hours. Most people fear power outages in Florida due to the extreme temperatures and the inability to find air conditioning in such an occasion. So you are aware the Florida born and raised can wear black sweater and a hoodie outside as I do this everyday. I wore the black hoodie to keep the sunlight off me. Even when I worked outside doing manual labor I kept a sweater on me. At lunch time when you take it off everything feels frigid like you just walked into a 73° house. This all comes from personal experience. If you're not seasoned for heat then you probably shouldn't be in Florida. It takes time for your body to be acclimated to the harsh climate here. What most people would consider suffering humidity we as Floridians don't really even notice it most of the time. Because when you're born in it, that just makes it business as usual. I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone. Democracy dies in the state. Heat makes people only care about what's actually important. So if you're from up North welcome to the Republic. Florida welcomes your soon-to-be Republic children.",2023-06-19 16:26:55

We’d love something nice for sure and if need be we can try to trim the guest list. We don’t need a grand Waikiki hotel wedding (though if there is one that fits our budget that would be great). Preferred location would be in town somewhere since we’d have several out-of-state visitors who would probably be staying in Waikiki. But open to other suggestions as well.

Preferences:
- indoors (or during cooler weather if outdoors)
- ceremony and reception in the same area
- dancefloor/DJ/MC
- buffet food
- 5pm - 11 pm(?)
- wedding planner
- photographer
- videographer

Generally speaking, is this budget pretty far-fetched or is it doable?

2249,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, love",Hawaii's Future with Solar & Combustion Backup,"I posted about this a month or so ago.    How reliable will Hawaii's electrical system be if we encounter periods of bad weather.     The 40 days of rain was once a Century probably - but having 5-7 days of stormy weather with very low UV is not that rare.

Yesterday we had our second largest combustion electric plant lose 2 of 6 generators.    So we lost about 10-12% of our total combustion generation on Oahu and ONE DAY of bad weather (west side hit hard all morning but east side still had sun until 2pm) - and our Entire Island Gets Rolling Blackouts!

Rough numbers are 1400-1600mw combustion on Oahu and that plant was about 500mw and 33% went down (assuming all 6 are normally running for the 500mw).   Top of my head after looking last night.  

Our system is that fragile that 10-12% can take down our entire island!   

Is Oahu going to keep backup combustion anywhere near low UV days elec demand?    I doubt it.

We are an island - we cant just take electric from another state when its cloudy.

Lawmakers are passing these retarded bills and when projects arent ready they still plow ahead regardless of what happens - like shutting down the clean coal plant and raising our rates 25% immediately.   Solar farms and battery storage wasnt ready.   

That power plant was producing up to 20% of our Electric needs.    Last night would not have happened.    It also produced electricity at $0.11 per khw.    That should have stayed open until solar and storage was ready.

How reliable will Hawaii's electrical system be if we encounter periods of bad weather.     The 40 days of rain was once a Century probably - but having 5-7 days of stormy weather with very low UV is not that rare.

Yesterday we had our second largest combustion electric plant lose 2 of 6 generators.    So we lost about 10-12% of our total combustion generation on Oahu and ONE DAY of bad weather (west side hit hard all morning but east side still had sun until 2pm) - and our Entire Island Gets Rolling Blackouts!

Rough numbers are 1400-1600mw combustion on Oahu and that plant was about 500mw and 33% went down (assuming all 6 are normally running for the 500mw).   Top of my head after looking last night.  

Our system is that fragile that 10-12% can take down our entire island!   

Is Oahu going to keep backup combustion anywhere near low UV days elec demand?    I doubt it.

We are an island - we cant just take electric from another state when its cloudy.

Lawmakers are passing these retarded bills and when projects arent ready they still plow ahead regardless of what happens - like shutting down the clean coal plant and raising our rates 25% immediately.   Solar farms and battery storage wasnt ready.   

That power plant was producing up to 20% of our Electric needs.    Last night would not have happened.    It also produced electricity at $0.11 per khw.    That should have stayed open until solar and storage was ready.

If I use my Tundra everyday for work I refill once a week. I’d spend around $70-90 on gas. It’s my dream truck but I know someone who is interested in it. My car would have to refill every 3-4 weeks at around $50-60 per tank. It’s got a hole on the roof so can’t really use it if it rains.

Been told that I would regret getting rid of my Tundra but the truth is I don’t even take it off-roading and a Tesla would provide the same things that an ICE vehicle would give me. We don’t rent so I could install the Tesla charger at home. I guess my question is do you regret going electric or do you enjoy your EV?

Edit: Wow, mahalo everyone for your input. I appreciate it. Reason why I’m looking into Tesla is because the 7-seater option would be perfect. Sometimes we go out as a family and we like to ride in just 1 car instead of bringing 2. Plus it’s affordable.

Besides having to hand deliver a cashier check each month on or before the 1st down in Honolulu which is super annoying.. we have been submitting trouble ticket emails, texts, and phone calls and our issues have not been getting addressed or repaired. 

1. Washer and Dryer were old and stopped working. We were told they would not be replacing it. This was in the rental agreement. We bought our own, but the washer and dryer have been left in the garage for weeks while they 'figure out what to do with it', while it takes up a car spot.. 

2. Our master bathroom sink faucet broke. Not only does it not turn off, the handle is completely broken. So we had to turn off the hot water to the sink. This means I have to shave in the guest bathroom.

3. Our downstairs toilet was ""ghost flushing"" a couple times a day. The handyman 'fixed' it, but now it ghost flushes 2 or 3 times an hour and leaks everywhere. We were told to just turn the water off to the toilet and not use it. It's been over a month. 

4. The roof was leaking during all the rain. So we report and and my wife crawls into the attic and puts my car wash bucket down to catch the water. So now I can't wash my car. 

5. Some smaller issues like a ceiling fan not working correctly.

I normally let me wife handle most of the conversations since I am a bit rough around the edges. I submit a formal notification of the above issues and the response was, ""We have to find someone else as our handyman is too busy."" 

Too busy???

None of these seem to be ""emergent"" so I don't think we can hire outside repair and deduct $500 from rent.. but we'd like to ask if there is anything else we can do? Not having a downstairs bathroom and not having a working master bathroom sink is quite frustrating.. ",2024-11-11 07:17:19

Yesterday we had our second largest combustion electric plant lose 2 of 6 generators.    So we lost about 10-12% of our total combustion generation on Oahu and ONE DAY of bad weather (west side hit hard all morning but east side still had sun until 2pm) - and our Entire Island Gets Rolling Blackouts!

Rough numbers are 1400-1600mw combustion on Oahu and that plant was about 500mw and 33% went down (assuming all 6 are normally running for the 500mw).   Top of my head after looking last night.  

Our system is that fragile that 10-12% can take down our entire island!   

Is Oahu going to keep backup combustion anywhere near low UV days elec demand?    I doubt it.

We are an island - we cant just take electric from another state when its cloudy.

Lawmakers are passing these retarded bills and when projects arent ready they still plow ahead regardless of what happens - like shutting down the clean coal plant and raising our rates 25% immediately.   Solar farms and battery storage wasnt ready.   

That power plant was producing up to 20% of our Electric needs.    Last night would not have happened.    It also produced electricity at $0.11 per khw.    That should have stayed open until solar and storage was ready.

2324,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, rain, happy",Bringing Awareness to HCDA-Controlled Honuakaha,"Hi all,

Please remove if not allowed.

I've been doing a lot of activism for the senior renters and condo owners in my building, Honuakaha. We had a ""wastewater leak"" (our property manager said it was a sewage leak at a board meeting) in the parking garage that was unaddressed for two months, and it was tracked into the elevator/hallways/units by walkers and other assistive devices. My boyfriend goes out that way to walk the dogs and his feet were stained for 3 days following that flood. Many senior units are being affected by leaks and mold, we have unlicensed and unpermitted work going on, no money going into the AOAO reserves. On the condo side, we are repeatedly flooded during heavy rains and at one point a few years ago, the flooding was so bad that it was coming down the elevator shaft and into the cab (this same elevator has now been non-functioning for close to 6 months).

HCDA is not only the developer for the building, but also our neighbor, the owner of the senior rental units, and make up 3/5 of our AOAO board. The last two parts are really messed up because they were delinquent \~$800k toward the AOAO two years ago and never addressed why or how, just gave themselves a loan from their revolving funds to pay it back. 

I've tried reaching out to DOH about the issues and they say it's not in their jurisdiction, so I went to the EPA, who said the same thing. I've gone to basically about everyone I could possibly go to, and it seems that no department or agency wants to help, so I've been reaching out to other grassroots organizers to help spread the word and provide some guidance. I've even reached out to the local and federal HUD offices + the OIG to report the conditions and possible Section 8 fraud, and they all say they can't help. Our legislators (Senator Moriwaki, Speaker Saiki, CM Dos Santos-Tam) have basically held several town hall meetings with residents that just leaves us more upset and don't actually address any of our issues, and the meetings are more of a venue for them and the HCDA to assuage us with flowery language and take photos for their social media and newsletters.

We are having a protest this week to bring awareness and show our area legislators and the HCDA that we are not happy with the way things are going and that it shouldn't take constant rallying and bad press to get them to act. I've tried reaching out to other legislators and the only person who took the time to respond was Rep. Pierick, so I'm reaching out here as well to try and reach a bigger audience.",2023-06-06 17:53:45

Besides having to hand deliver a cashier check each month on or before the 1st down in Honolulu which is super annoying.. we have been submitting trouble ticket emails, texts, and phone calls and our issues have not been getting addressed or repaired. 

1. Washer and Dryer were old and stopped working. We were told they would not be replacing it. This was in the rental agreement. We bought our own, but the washer and dryer have been left in the garage for weeks while they 'figure out what to do with it', while it takes up a car spot.. 

2. Our master bathroom sink faucet broke. Not only does it not turn off, the handle is completely broken. So we had to turn off the hot water to the sink. This means I have to shave in the guest bathroom.

3. Our downstairs toilet was ""ghost flushing"" a couple times a day. The handyman 'fixed' it, but now it ghost flushes 2 or 3 times an hour and leaks everywhere. We were told to just turn the water off to the toilet and not use it. It's been over a month. 

4. The roof was leaking during all the rain. So we report and and my wife crawls into the attic and puts my car wash bucket down to catch the water. So now I can't wash my car. 

5. Some smaller issues like a ceiling fan not working correctly.

I normally let me wife handle most of the conversations since I am a bit rough around the edges. I submit a formal notification of the above issues and the response was, ""We have to find someone else as our handyman is too busy."" 

Too busy???

None of these seem to be ""emergent"" so I don't think we can hire outside repair and deduct $500 from rent.. but we'd like to ask if there is anything else we can do? Not having a downstairs bathroom and not having a working master bathroom sink is quite frustrating.. ",2024-11-11 07:17:19

Parked cars blocking the pathway. Not an anomaly.

It's the worst when it rains. I sit comfortably in my car but I see all the pooled up water puddles. Poor road infrastructure. Poor design. I see people get [splashed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGokHZZJo2I) by drivers who once used to walk. I slow down but the puddle is still there and will be there again the next time it rains.

I see people waiting at the bus stop. People missing the bus stop. People waiting on the crosswalk to get to the bus across the street. They miss it, because they had to wait for the light to change. I remember that feeling. I too had to wait more than half an hour for the next bus to go home because I did not cross in time.

I see people waiting at a crosswalk sometimes. I find it strange. Why? I figure it out. In this area, everyone drives. A person walking is strange. The sidewalk ahead ends into nothing. They'll find out soon they aren't meant to walk here.

Sometimes I do walk. If I'm lucky, it's around a mall or in Waikiki. Other times though, it's on a normal road. I walk through skinny sidewalks. Occasionally, fat ones.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Last week, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) began monitoring the east-central Pacific Ocean for potential tropical cyclone development. Over the weekend, two areas of low pressure developed in this region.  The NHC designated these systems *Invest 90E* and *Invest 91E*.  The two disturbances developed close enough to one another that they began to interact, with the stronger of two disturbances (Invest 91E) drawing its weaker companion (Invest 90E) toward itself.  Eventually, the stronger disturbance had absorbed the weaker disturbance and became much more organized.  On Thursday morning, Invest 91E crossed into the central Pacific (west of 140°W) and developed into a tropical depression which later strengthened into Tropical Storm Hone.  Hone is the first named storm to develop within the central Pacific basin since Ema in 2019.

Tropical Weather Outlook
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI
200 PM HST Sat Aug 17 2024

For the central North Pacific...between 140W and 180W:

1. Approximately 1900 miles east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii:
Scattered showers and thunderstorms are associated with a broad 
trough of low pressure located more than one thousand miles 
west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California 
peninsula. While this system may interact with another area of low 
pressure to its west-southwest over the next several days, some 
gradual development of this system is forecasted if it becomes the 
dominant disturbance. A tropical depression is likely form during 
the middle part of next week while the system moves westward 
to west-northwestward over the western portion of the basin and 
into the Central Pacific basin by the end of the week. 
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.


2. Approximately 1100 miles east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii:
A small area of low pressure located well southeast of the Hawaiian 
Islands is associated with some disorganized showers and 
thunderstorms. Some development of this system is possible this 
weekend into early next week while it moves slowly over the western 
portion of the East Pacific or Central Pacific basin. By the middle 
of next week, this system could merge with a larger system 
developing to its east. 
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.

We’d love something nice for sure and if need be we can try to trim the guest list. We don’t need a grand Waikiki hotel wedding (though if there is one that fits our budget that would be great). Preferred location would be in town somewhere since we’d have several out-of-state visitors who would probably be staying in Waikiki. But open to other suggestions as well.

Preferences:
- indoors (or during cooler weather if outdoors)
- ceremony and reception in the same area
- dancefloor/DJ/MC
- buffet food
- 5pm - 11 pm(?)
- wedding planner
- photographer
- videographer

Generally speaking, is this budget pretty far-fetched or is it doable?

The budget is after putting down payment for our home. My fiance and I both agreed to prioritize housing over wedding. We’re looking at aiming for 2025.",2023-09-10 21:21:03

The Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) began monitoring a broad area of low pressure situated well to the southeast of Hawaii on Saturday morning.  Although the disturbance initially showed potential to develop into a tropical cyclone, it failed to consolidate sufficiently before reaching unfavorably strong upper-level winds to the south of the islands.  Satellite imagery analysis shows that the disturbance remains a broad area of low pressure with sporadic and disorganized showers and thunderstorms.

> Visible satellite imagery shows that Calvin's fully exposed low-
level center is becoming increasingly broad and ill-defined. 
Subjective Dvorak fixes indicate that Calvin is too weak to 
classify, and central convection has been absent for sufficiently 
long that Calvin can safely be deemed post-tropical. Gale force 
winds continue in the northern semicircle for now, but increased 
vertical wind shear along the forecast track will prevent Calvin 
from redeveloping. The updated forecast track lies close to the 
well-performing HCCA and ECMWF guidance, with dissipation expected 
in about 36 hours as the environment becomes increasingly hostile.

The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring an area of potential tropical cyclone development to the southwest of Mexico on Tuesday, August 13.  A broad area of low pressure developed in this region two days later and was designated *Invest 92E.*  The disturbance gradually became better organized as it continued west-northwestward away from Mexico.  On Sunday, August 18, the NHC upgraded the disturbance to *Tropical Depression Seven-E*, which strengthened into *Tropical Storm Gilma* later in the day.

Within the next couple of days, Gilma continued to steadily strengthen, reaching hurricane strength on Wednesday, August 21.  Within 24 hours, the storm strengthened into a major hurricane and reached its first peak intensity of 125 miles per hour on Thursday.  After briefly weakening back to a Category 1 hurricane, Gilma unexpectedly and rapidly re-strengthen on Saturday, August 24, reaching Category 4 intensity and a new peak of 130 miles per hour.  The storm continued to fluctuate in strength over the next couple of days, but ultimately started to rapidly weaken as it entered the central Pacific on Tuesday, 27 August.

Last week, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) began monitoring the east-central Pacific Ocean for potential tropical cyclone development. Over the weekend, two areas of low pressure developed in this region.  The NHC designated these systems *Invest 90E* and *Invest 91E*.  The two disturbances developed close enough to one another that they began to interact, with the stronger of two disturbances (Invest 91E) drawing its weaker companion (Invest 90E) toward itself.  Eventually, the stronger disturbance had absorbed the weaker disturbance and became much more organized.  On Thursday morning, Invest 91E crossed into the central Pacific (west of 140°W) and developed into a tropical depression which later strengthened into Tropical Storm Hone.  Hone is the first named storm to develop within the central Pacific basin since Ema in 2019.

Tropical Weather Outlook
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI
200 PM HST Sat Aug 17 2024

For the central North Pacific...between 140W and 180W:

1. Approximately 1900 miles east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii:
Scattered showers and thunderstorms are associated with a broad 
trough of low pressure located more than one thousand miles 
west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California 
peninsula. While this system may interact with another area of low 
pressure to its west-southwest over the next several days, some 
gradual development of this system is forecasted if it becomes the 
dominant disturbance. A tropical depression is likely form during 
the middle part of next week while the system moves westward 
to west-northwestward over the western portion of the basin and 
into the Central Pacific basin by the end of the week. 
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.


2. Approximately 1100 miles east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii:
A small area of low pressure located well southeast of the Hawaiian 
Islands is associated with some disorganized showers and 
thunderstorms. Some development of this system is possible this 
weekend into early next week while it moves slowly over the western 
portion of the East Pacific or Central Pacific basin. By the middle 
of next week, this system could merge with a larger system 
developing to its east. 
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.

don’t know if it’s js my area but it’s been really windy and cold as of late, the rain has been a constant on and off and I don’t see any mentions of a typhoon or anything.

Is there an explanation for the bipolar weather??? I’ve been in Kalihi since I was born and the only reason why Hawaii would have this kind of weather is if a storm / typhoon is passing by us.

The Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) began monitoring a broad area of low pressure situated well to the southeast of Hawaii on Saturday morning.  Although the disturbance initially showed potential to develop into a tropical cyclone, it failed to consolidate sufficiently before reaching unfavorably strong upper-level winds to the south of the islands.  Satellite imagery analysis shows that the disturbance remains a broad area of low pressure with sporadic and disorganized showers and thunderstorms.

> Visible satellite imagery shows that Calvin's fully exposed low-
level center is becoming increasingly broad and ill-defined. 
Subjective Dvorak fixes indicate that Calvin is too weak to 
classify, and central convection has been absent for sufficiently 
long that Calvin can safely be deemed post-tropical. Gale force 
winds continue in the northern semicircle for now, but increased 
vertical wind shear along the forecast track will prevent Calvin 
from redeveloping. The updated forecast track lies close to the 
well-performing HCCA and ECMWF guidance, with dissipation expected 
in about 36 hours as the environment becomes increasingly hostile.

The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring an area of potential tropical cyclone development to the southwest of Mexico on Tuesday, August 13.  A broad area of low pressure developed in this region two days later and was designated *Invest 92E.*  The disturbance gradually became better organized as it continued west-northwestward away from Mexico.  On Sunday, August 18, the NHC upgraded the disturbance to *Tropical Depression Seven-E*, which strengthened into *Tropical Storm Gilma* later in the day.

Within the next couple of days, Gilma continued to steadily strengthen, reaching hurricane strength on Wednesday, August 21.  Within 24 hours, the storm strengthened into a major hurricane and reached its first peak intensity of 125 miles per hour on Thursday.  After briefly weakening back to a Category 1 hurricane, Gilma unexpectedly and rapidly re-strengthen on Saturday, August 24, reaching Category 4 intensity and a new peak of 130 miles per hour.  The storm continued to fluctuate in strength over the next couple of days, but ultimately started to rapidly weaken as it entered the central Pacific on Tuesday, 27 August.

NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI
200 PM HST Sat Aug 17 2024

For the central North Pacific...between 140W and 180W:

1. Approximately 1900 miles east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii:
Scattered showers and thunderstorms are associated with a broad 
trough of low pressure located more than one thousand miles 
west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California 
peninsula. While this system may interact with another area of low 
pressure to its west-southwest over the next several days, some 
gradual development of this system is forecasted if it becomes the 
dominant disturbance. A tropical depression is likely form during 
the middle part of next week while the system moves westward 
to west-northwestward over the western portion of the basin and 
into the Central Pacific basin by the end of the week. 
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.


2. Approximately 1100 miles east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii:
A small area of low pressure located well southeast of the Hawaiian 
Islands is associated with some disorganized showers and 
thunderstorms. Some development of this system is possible this 
weekend into early next week while it moves slowly over the western 
portion of the East Pacific or Central Pacific basin. By the middle 
of next week, this system could merge with a larger system 
developing to its east. 
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.

The Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) began monitoring a broad area of low pressure situated well to the southeast of Hawaii on Saturday morning.  Although the disturbance initially showed potential to develop into a tropical cyclone, it failed to consolidate sufficiently before reaching unfavorably strong upper-level winds to the south of the islands.  Satellite imagery analysis shows that the disturbance remains a broad area of low pressure with sporadic and disorganized showers and thunderstorms.

**Current Advisory Message as of 7/19/2023 11:00 AM FINAL UPDATE**

> Visible satellite imagery shows that Calvin's fully exposed low-
level center is becoming increasingly broad and ill-defined. 
Subjective Dvorak fixes indicate that Calvin is too weak to 
classify, and central convection has been absent for sufficiently 
long that Calvin can safely be deemed post-tropical. Gale force 
winds continue in the northern semicircle for now, but increased 
vertical wind shear along the forecast track will prevent Calvin 
from redeveloping. The updated forecast track lies close to the 
well-performing HCCA and ECMWF guidance, with dissipation expected 
in about 36 hours as the environment becomes increasingly hostile.

The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring an area of potential tropical cyclone development to the southwest of Mexico on Tuesday, August 13.  A broad area of low pressure developed in this region two days later and was designated *Invest 92E.*  The disturbance gradually became better organized as it continued west-northwestward away from Mexico.  On Sunday, August 18, the NHC upgraded the disturbance to *Tropical Depression Seven-E*, which strengthened into *Tropical Storm Gilma* later in the day.

Within the next couple of days, Gilma continued to steadily strengthen, reaching hurricane strength on Wednesday, August 21.  Within 24 hours, the storm strengthened into a major hurricane and reached its first peak intensity of 125 miles per hour on Thursday.  After briefly weakening back to a Category 1 hurricane, Gilma unexpectedly and rapidly re-strengthen on Saturday, August 24, reaching Category 4 intensity and a new peak of 130 miles per hour.  The storm continued to fluctuate in strength over the next couple of days, but ultimately started to rapidly weaken as it entered the central Pacific on Tuesday, 27 August.

Last week, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) began monitoring the east-central Pacific Ocean for potential tropical cyclone development. Over the weekend, two areas of low pressure developed in this region.  The NHC designated these systems *Invest 90E* and *Invest 91E*.  The two disturbances developed close enough to one another that they began to interact, with the stronger of two disturbances (Invest 91E) drawing its weaker companion (Invest 90E) toward itself.  Eventually, the stronger disturbance had absorbed the weaker disturbance and became much more organized.  On Thursday morning, Invest 91E crossed into the central Pacific (west of 140°W) and developed into a tropical depression which later strengthened into Tropical Storm Hone.  Hone is the first named storm to develop within the central Pacific basin since Ema in 2019.

A broad area of low pressure developed in this region two days later and was designated *Invest 92E.*  The disturbance gradually became better organized as it continued west-northwestward away from Mexico.  On Sunday, August 18, the NHC upgraded the disturbance to *Tropical Depression Seven-E*, which strengthened into *Tropical Storm Gilma* later in the day.

Within the next couple of days, Gilma continued to steadily strengthen, reaching hurricane strength on Wednesday, August 21.  Within 24 hours, the storm strengthened into a major hurricane and reached its first peak intensity of 125 miles per hour on Thursday.  After briefly weakening back to a Category 1 hurricane, Gilma unexpectedly and rapidly re-strengthen on Saturday, August 24, reaching Category 4 intensity and a new peak of 130 miles per hour.  The storm continued to fluctuate in strength over the next couple of days, but ultimately started to rapidly weaken as it entered the central Pacific on Tuesday, 27 August.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Last week, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) began monitoring the east-central Pacific Ocean for potential tropical cyclone development. Over the weekend, two areas of low pressure developed in this region.  The NHC designated these systems *Invest 90E* and *Invest 91E*.  The two disturbances developed close enough to one another that they began to interact, with the stronger of two disturbances (Invest 91E) drawing its weaker companion (Invest 90E) toward itself.  Eventually, the stronger disturbance had absorbed the weaker disturbance and became much more organized.  On Thursday morning, Invest 91E crossed into the central Pacific (west of 140°W) and developed into a tropical depression which later strengthened into Tropical Storm Hone.  Hone is the first named storm to develop within the central Pacific basin since Ema in 2019.

Tropical Weather Outlook
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI
200 PM HST Sat Aug 17 2024

For the central North Pacific...between 140W and 180W:

1. Approximately 1900 miles east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii:
Scattered showers and thunderstorms are associated with a broad 
trough of low pressure located more than one thousand miles 
west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California 
peninsula. While this system may interact with another area of low 
pressure to its west-southwest over the next several days, some 
gradual development of this system is forecasted if it becomes the 
dominant disturbance. A tropical depression is likely form during 
the middle part of next week while the system moves westward 
to west-northwestward over the western portion of the basin and 
into the Central Pacific basin by the end of the week. 
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.


2. Approximately 1100 miles east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii:
A small area of low pressure located well southeast of the Hawaiian 
Islands is associated with some disorganized showers and 
thunderstorms. Some development of this system is possible this 
weekend into early next week while it moves slowly over the western 
portion of the East Pacific or Central Pacific basin. By the middle 
of next week, this system could merge with a larger system 
developing to its east. 
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.

The Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) began monitoring a broad area of low pressure situated well to the southeast of Hawaii on Saturday morning.  Although the disturbance initially showed potential to develop into a tropical cyclone, it failed to consolidate sufficiently before reaching unfavorably strong upper-level winds to the south of the islands.  Satellite imagery analysis shows that the disturbance remains a broad area of low pressure with sporadic and disorganized showers and thunderstorms.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Last week, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) began monitoring the east-central Pacific Ocean for potential tropical cyclone development. Over the weekend, two areas of low pressure developed in this region.  The NHC designated these systems *Invest 90E* and *Invest 91E*.  The two disturbances developed close enough to one another that they began to interact, with the stronger of two disturbances (Invest 91E) drawing its weaker companion (Invest 90E) toward itself.  Eventually, the stronger disturbance had absorbed the weaker disturbance and became much more organized.  On Thursday morning, Invest 91E crossed into the central Pacific (west of 140°W) and developed into a tropical depression which later strengthened into Tropical Storm Hone.  Hone is the first named storm to develop within the central Pacific basin since Ema in 2019.

NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI
200 PM HST Sat Aug 17 2024

For the central North Pacific...between 140W and 180W:

1. Approximately 1900 miles east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii:
Scattered showers and thunderstorms are associated with a broad 
trough of low pressure located more than one thousand miles 
west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California 
peninsula. While this system may interact with another area of low 
pressure to its west-southwest over the next several days, some 
gradual development of this system is forecasted if it becomes the 
dominant disturbance. A tropical depression is likely form during 
the middle part of next week while the system moves westward 
to west-northwestward over the western portion of the basin and 
into the Central Pacific basin by the end of the week. 
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.


2. Approximately 1100 miles east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii:
A small area of low pressure located well southeast of the Hawaiian 
Islands is associated with some disorganized showers and 
thunderstorms. Some development of this system is possible this 
weekend into early next week while it moves slowly over the western 
portion of the East Pacific or Central Pacific basin. By the middle 
of next week, this system could merge with a larger system 
developing to its east. 
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.

The Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) began monitoring a broad area of low pressure situated well to the southeast of Hawaii on Saturday morning.  Although the disturbance initially showed potential to develop into a tropical cyclone, it failed to consolidate sufficiently before reaching unfavorably strong upper-level winds to the south of the islands.  Satellite imagery analysis shows that the disturbance remains a broad area of low pressure with sporadic and disorganized showers and thunderstorms.

> Visible satellite imagery shows that Calvin's fully exposed low-
level center is becoming increasingly broad and ill-defined. 
Subjective Dvorak fixes indicate that Calvin is too weak to 
classify, and central convection has been absent for sufficiently 
long that Calvin can safely be deemed post-tropical. Gale force 
winds continue in the northern semicircle for now, but increased 
vertical wind shear along the forecast track will prevent Calvin 
from redeveloping. The updated forecast track lies close to the 
well-performing HCCA and ECMWF guidance, with dissipation expected 
in about 36 hours as the environment becomes increasingly hostile.

The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring an area of potential tropical cyclone development to the southwest of Mexico on Tuesday, August 13.  A broad area of low pressure developed in this region two days later and was designated *Invest 92E.*  The disturbance gradually became better organized as it continued west-northwestward away from Mexico.  On Sunday, August 18, the NHC upgraded the disturbance to *Tropical Depression Seven-E*, which strengthened into *Tropical Storm Gilma* later in the day.

Within the next couple of days, Gilma continued to steadily strengthen, reaching hurricane strength on Wednesday, August 21.  Within 24 hours, the storm strengthened into a major hurricane and reached its first peak intensity of 125 miles per hour on Thursday.  After briefly weakening back to a Category 1 hurricane, Gilma unexpectedly and rapidly re-strengthen on Saturday, August 24, reaching Category 4 intensity and a new peak of 130 miles per hour.  The storm continued to fluctuate in strength over the next couple of days, but ultimately started to rapidly weaken as it entered the central Pacific on Tuesday, 27 August.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Last week, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) began monitoring the east-central Pacific Ocean for potential tropical cyclone development. Over the weekend, two areas of low pressure developed in this region.  The NHC designated these systems *Invest 90E* and *Invest 91E*.  The two disturbances developed close enough to one another that they began to interact, with the stronger of two disturbances (Invest 91E) drawing its weaker companion (Invest 90E) toward itself.  Eventually, the stronger disturbance had absorbed the weaker disturbance and became much more organized.  On Thursday morning, Invest 91E crossed into the central Pacific (west of 140°W) and developed into a tropical depression which later strengthened into Tropical Storm Hone.  Hone is the first named storm to develop within the central Pacific basin since Ema in 2019.

Tropical Weather Outlook
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI
200 PM HST Sat Aug 17 2024

For the central North Pacific...between 140W and 180W:

1. Approximately 1900 miles east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii:
Scattered showers and thunderstorms are associated with a broad 
trough of low pressure located more than one thousand miles 
west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California 
peninsula. While this system may interact with another area of low 
pressure to its west-southwest over the next several days, some 
gradual development of this system is forecasted if it becomes the 
dominant disturbance. A tropical depression is likely form during 
the middle part of next week while the system moves westward 
to west-northwestward over the western portion of the basin and 
into the Central Pacific basin by the end of the week. 
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.


2. Approximately 1100 miles east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii:
A small area of low pressure located well southeast of the Hawaiian 
Islands is associated with some disorganized showers and 
thunderstorms. Some development of this system is possible this 
weekend into early next week while it moves slowly over the western 
portion of the East Pacific or Central Pacific basin. By the middle 
of next week, this system could merge with a larger system 
developing to its east. 
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.

don’t know if it’s js my area but it’s been really windy and cold as of late, the rain has been a constant on and off and I don’t see any mentions of a typhoon or anything.

Is there an explanation for the bipolar weather??? I’ve been in Kalihi since I was born and the only reason why Hawaii would have this kind of weather is if a storm / typhoon is passing by us.

The Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) began monitoring a broad area of low pressure situated well to the southeast of Hawaii on Saturday morning.  Although the disturbance initially showed potential to develop into a tropical cyclone, it failed to consolidate sufficiently before reaching unfavorably strong upper-level winds to the south of the islands.  Satellite imagery analysis shows that the disturbance remains a broad area of low pressure with sporadic and disorganized showers and thunderstorms.

> Visible satellite imagery shows that Calvin's fully exposed low-
level center is becoming increasingly broad and ill-defined. 
Subjective Dvorak fixes indicate that Calvin is too weak to 
classify, and central convection has been absent for sufficiently 
long that Calvin can safely be deemed post-tropical. Gale force 
winds continue in the northern semicircle for now, but increased 
vertical wind shear along the forecast track will prevent Calvin 
from redeveloping. The updated forecast track lies close to the 
well-performing HCCA and ECMWF guidance, with dissipation expected 
in about 36 hours as the environment becomes increasingly hostile.

The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring an area of potential tropical cyclone development to the southwest of Mexico on Tuesday, August 13.  A broad area of low pressure developed in this region two days later and was designated *Invest 92E.*  The disturbance gradually became better organized as it continued west-northwestward away from Mexico.  On Sunday, August 18, the NHC upgraded the disturbance to *Tropical Depression Seven-E*, which strengthened into *Tropical Storm Gilma* later in the day.

Within the next couple of days, Gilma continued to steadily strengthen, reaching hurricane strength on Wednesday, August 21.  Within 24 hours, the storm strengthened into a major hurricane and reached its first peak intensity of 125 miles per hour on Thursday.  After briefly weakening back to a Category 1 hurricane, Gilma unexpectedly and rapidly re-strengthen on Saturday, August 24, reaching Category 4 intensity and a new peak of 130 miles per hour.  The storm continued to fluctuate in strength over the next couple of days, but ultimately started to rapidly weaken as it entered the central Pacific on Tuesday, 27 August.

200 PM HST Sat Aug 17 2024

For the central North Pacific...between 140W and 180W:

1. Approximately 1900 miles east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii:
Scattered showers and thunderstorms are associated with a broad 
trough of low pressure located more than one thousand miles 
west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California 
peninsula. While this system may interact with another area of low 
pressure to its west-southwest over the next several days, some 
gradual development of this system is forecasted if it becomes the 
dominant disturbance. A tropical depression is likely form during 
the middle part of next week while the system moves westward 
to west-northwestward over the western portion of the basin and 
into the Central Pacific basin by the end of the week. 
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.


2. Approximately 1100 miles east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii:
A small area of low pressure located well southeast of the Hawaiian 
Islands is associated with some disorganized showers and 
thunderstorms. Some development of this system is possible this 
weekend into early next week while it moves slowly over the western 
portion of the East Pacific or Central Pacific basin. By the middle 
of next week, this system could merge with a larger system 
developing to its east. 
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.

The Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) began monitoring a broad area of low pressure situated well to the southeast of Hawaii on Saturday morning.  Although the disturbance initially showed potential to develop into a tropical cyclone, it failed to consolidate sufficiently before reaching unfavorably strong upper-level winds to the south of the islands.  Satellite imagery analysis shows that the disturbance remains a broad area of low pressure with sporadic and disorganized showers and thunderstorms.

> Visible satellite imagery shows that Calvin's fully exposed low-
level center is becoming increasingly broad and ill-defined. 
Subjective Dvorak fixes indicate that Calvin is too weak to 
classify, and central convection has been absent for sufficiently 
long that Calvin can safely be deemed post-tropical. Gale force 
winds continue in the northern semicircle for now, but increased 
vertical wind shear along the forecast track will prevent Calvin 
from redeveloping. The updated forecast track lies close to the 
well-performing HCCA and ECMWF guidance, with dissipation expected 
in about 36 hours as the environment becomes increasingly hostile.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring an area of potential tropical cyclone development to the southwest of Mexico on Tuesday, August 13.  A broad area of low pressure developed in this region two days later and was designated *Invest 92E.*  The disturbance gradually became better organized as it continued west-northwestward away from Mexico.  On Sunday, August 18, the NHC upgraded the disturbance to *Tropical Depression Seven-E*, which strengthened into *Tropical Storm Gilma* later in the day.

Within the next couple of days, Gilma continued to steadily strengthen, reaching hurricane strength on Wednesday, August 21.  Within 24 hours, the storm strengthened into a major hurricane and reached its first peak intensity of 125 miles per hour on Thursday.  After briefly weakening back to a Category 1 hurricane, Gilma unexpectedly and rapidly re-strengthen on Saturday, August 24, reaching Category 4 intensity and a new peak of 130 miles per hour.  The storm continued to fluctuate in strength over the next couple of days, but ultimately started to rapidly weaken as it entered the central Pacific on Tuesday, 27 August.

We’d love something nice for sure and if need be we can try to trim the guest list. We don’t need a grand Waikiki hotel wedding (though if there is one that fits our budget that would be great). Preferred location would be in town somewhere since we’d have several out-of-state visitors who would probably be staying in Waikiki. But open to other suggestions as well.

- indoors (or during cooler weather if outdoors)
- ceremony and reception in the same area
- dancefloor/DJ/MC
- buffet food
- 5pm - 11 pm(?)
- wedding planner
- photographer
- videographer

The Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) began monitoring a broad area of low pressure situated well to the southeast of Hawaii on Saturday morning.  Although the disturbance initially showed potential to develop into a tropical cyclone, it failed to consolidate sufficiently before reaching unfavorably strong upper-level winds to the south of the islands.  Satellite imagery analysis shows that the disturbance remains a broad area of low pressure with sporadic and disorganized showers and thunderstorms.

For the central North Pacific...between 140W and 180W:

1. Approximately 1900 miles east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii:
Scattered showers and thunderstorms are associated with a broad 
trough of low pressure located more than one thousand miles 
west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California 
peninsula. While this system may interact with another area of low 
pressure to its west-southwest over the next several days, some 
gradual development of this system is forecasted if it becomes the 
dominant disturbance. A tropical depression is likely form during 
the middle part of next week while the system moves westward 
to west-northwestward over the western portion of the basin and 
into the Central Pacific basin by the end of the week. 
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.


2. Approximately 1100 miles east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii:
A small area of low pressure located well southeast of the Hawaiian 
Islands is associated with some disorganized showers and 
thunderstorms. Some development of this system is possible this 
weekend into early next week while it moves slowly over the western 
portion of the East Pacific or Central Pacific basin. By the middle 
of next week, this system could merge with a larger system 
developing to its east. 
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.

Tropical Weather Outlook
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI
200 PM HST Sat Aug 17 2024

For the central North Pacific...between 140W and 180W:

1. Approximately 1900 miles east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii:
Scattered showers and thunderstorms are associated with a broad 
trough of low pressure located more than one thousand miles 
west-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California 
peninsula. While this system may interact with another area of low 
pressure to its west-southwest over the next several days, some 
gradual development of this system is forecasted if it becomes the 
dominant disturbance. A tropical depression is likely form during 
the middle part of next week while the system moves westward 
to west-northwestward over the western portion of the basin and 
into the Central Pacific basin by the end of the week. 
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...high...70 percent.


2. Approximately 1100 miles east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii:
A small area of low pressure located well southeast of the Hawaiian 
Islands is associated with some disorganized showers and 
thunderstorms. Some development of this system is possible this 
weekend into early next week while it moves slowly over the western 
portion of the East Pacific or Central Pacific basin. By the middle 
of next week, this system could merge with a larger system 
developing to its east. 
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.
* Formation chance through 7 days...low...20 percent.

2530,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, thunderstorm, comfortable",Storm Watch: A disturbance well to the southeast of Hawaii is likely to become a tropical depression or storm later this week,"# Background
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) began monitoring a broad area of low pressure situated well to the southeast of Hawaii on Saturday morning.  Although the disturbance initially showed potential to develop into a tropical cyclone, it failed to consolidate sufficiently before reaching unfavorably strong upper-level winds to the south of the islands.  Satellite imagery analysis shows that the disturbance remains a broad area of low pressure with sporadic and disorganized showers and thunderstorms.



# Latest observation

This system no longer has a trackable center of circulation.


# Development potential
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
**2-day potential:** (through 8PM Thu)   |     |  **low** (10 percent)

2606,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, rainy, love",Abercrombie outburst highlights tensions with Gov. Green Nominees,"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2023/02/18/hawaii-news/abercrombie-outburst-highlights-stress-with-gov-green-nominees/

Gov. Josh Green has urged state senators to treat his Cabinet nominees with courtesy and respect, but some senators say it goes both ways after one was called an “idiot” by no less than former Gov. Neil Abercrombie at this week’s confirmation hearing for Ikaika Anderson.

Abercrombie told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that he apologized to state Sen. Jarrett Keohokalole by telephone Friday for calling Keohokalole “an idiot” while seated in the front row of Tuesday’s hearing on Anderson to run the state Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.

Keohokalole told the Star-Advertiser that he accepted Abercrombie’s apology, and both said they hope to move on.

The name-calling of a sitting senator by a former governor in a public hearing, however, underscores the tensions, emotions and pressure around some of Green’s 20 Cabinet appointees and their deputies as Green begins the search for another nominee to run DHHL after Anderson withdrew his name from consideration following the contentious hearing.

DHHL is under incredible public pressure to develop a plan to spend a record $600 million in state funding to help clear the waitlist of 28,000 Hawaiians across the state who have been promised homes.

Keohokalole (D, Kaneohe- Kailua) and state Sen. Les Ihara (D, Palolo-Kaimuki- Moiliili) both voted against recommending Anderson’s confirmation following the five-hour hearing of the Senate Committee on Hawaiian Affairs.

Ihara stood on the floor of the Senate the day after Anderson’s hearing and condemned Abercrombie’s behavior without naming either him or Keohokalole.

Instead, Ihara said that a “former governor” had called out a senator.

“He called him an idiot,” Ihara said. Senate rules ask “that we stand up to protect visitors and senators to this Capitol building from indignities to our humanity.”

Abercrombie considers Anderson his “son,” and Keohokalole said he would expect that his family and friends would be just as passionate in defending him.

But the incident also raises expectations about how Green’s other controversial nominees may be treated in their own separate confirmation hearings.

A “humbled” Abercrombie called his outburst “regretful and unfortunate” and said he hopes that it will help turn down the temperature around Anderson’s successor and other Cabinet appointees.

“Everybody has something to learn,” Abercrombie said. “Hopefully, ironically, I hope a cooler and calmer atmosphere will prevail and the personality drama disappears. I was grateful for his (Keohokalole’s) graciousness.”

Both Keohokalole and Abercrombie acknowledged the emotion and passion around helping Home Lands beneficiaries and hope to focus on that mission.

“Our eyes should be on the prize,” Abercrombie said.

Keohokalole said, “I accept his apology and want to move on. I do not hold against anyone the animosity that’s generated when we in the Senate are critical of people that they love when they are up for vetting and confirmation. It’s a difficult process that I don’t enjoy. I don’t harbor animosity against friends and family members who do not like their loved one being asked hard questions. Civility is a two-way street, and I’m prepared to do my best to be dignified and civil.”

Different Senate committees will hold individual confirmation hearings on Green’s other nominees. It’s unclear whether the hopes of civility by Abercrombie and Keohokalole will come to fruition, said Colin Moore, director of the University of Hawaii’s Public Policy Center.

“Gov. Abercrombie knows his behavior was wrong,” Moore said. “But it goes to show that the atmosphere is very tense around these confirmations. We’re coming up on some others that can be tense as well,” such as Green’s appointees for attorney general and the head of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources.

Moore said the Senate is “not going to be a rubber stamp.”

For nominees, he said, “you are really putting yourself out there for public scrutiny. Any negative things you’ve done in your career are going to come out.”",2023-02-19 06:21:28

I usually run the A/C when it's hot and turn it off / open the windows when it's cooler.

For heat pumps, the guidance seems to be ""[set it and forget it](https://www.efficiencymaine.com/heat-pump-user-tip-set-it-and-forget-it/)"" but it still feels pretty weird to open the windows with the unit on. We've been maintaining a temperature of 75f with the fan on auto. We open the windows when we wake up (usually 5am) and close them when the outside temp reaches 75 (usually 10am). The unit stays on blowing a very small amount of colder air into the room even when the temperature is lower than 75. This is way different than the window or portable units that have the compressor kicking on and off as it reaches the temperature threshold.

Another thing that may be specific to a high rise: we love the night time temperature in Hawaii and usually slept with windows open and fans going.

Last weekend, the outside temp dropped below 75 pretty quickly after the sun went down but despite all the windows open and fans going, the interior of our apartment never got below 80 and was pretty hot/humid when we woke up in the morning. My theory is that the exterior of the building was still warmed from the sun and we caught the rising heat in our windows instead of fresh air.

Gov. Josh Green has urged state senators to treat his Cabinet nominees with courtesy and respect, but some senators say it goes both ways after one was called an “idiot” by no less than former Gov. Neil Abercrombie at this week’s confirmation hearing for Ikaika Anderson.

Abercrombie told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that he apologized to state Sen. Jarrett Keohokalole by telephone Friday for calling Keohokalole “an idiot” while seated in the front row of Tuesday’s hearing on Anderson to run the state Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.

Keohokalole told the Star-Advertiser that he accepted Abercrombie’s apology, and both said they hope to move on.

The name-calling of a sitting senator by a former governor in a public hearing, however, underscores the tensions, emotions and pressure around some of Green’s 20 Cabinet appointees and their deputies as Green begins the search for another nominee to run DHHL after Anderson withdrew his name from consideration following the contentious hearing.

DHHL is under incredible public pressure to develop a plan to spend a record $600 million in state funding to help clear the waitlist of 28,000 Hawaiians across the state who have been promised homes.

Keohokalole (D, Kaneohe- Kailua) and state Sen. Les Ihara (D, Palolo-Kaimuki- Moiliili) both voted against recommending Anderson’s confirmation following the five-hour hearing of the Senate Committee on Hawaiian Affairs.

Ihara stood on the floor of the Senate the day after Anderson’s hearing and condemned Abercrombie’s behavior without naming either him or Keohokalole.

Instead, Ihara said that a “former governor” had called out a senator.

“He called him an idiot,” Ihara said. Senate rules ask “that we stand up to protect visitors and senators to this Capitol building from indignities to our humanity.”

Abercrombie considers Anderson his “son,” and Keohokalole said he would expect that his family and friends would be just as passionate in defending him.

But the incident also raises expectations about how Green’s other controversial nominees may be treated in their own separate confirmation hearings.

A “humbled” Abercrombie called his outburst “regretful and unfortunate” and said he hopes that it will help turn down the temperature around Anderson’s successor and other Cabinet appointees.

“Everybody has something to learn,” Abercrombie said. “Hopefully, ironically, I hope a cooler and calmer atmosphere will prevail and the personality drama disappears. I was grateful for his (Keohokalole’s) graciousness.”

Both Keohokalole and Abercrombie acknowledged the emotion and passion around helping Home Lands beneficiaries and hope to focus on that mission.

“Our eyes should be on the prize,” Abercrombie said.

Keohokalole said, “I accept his apology and want to move on. I do not hold against anyone the animosity that’s generated when we in the Senate are critical of people that they love when they are up for vetting and confirmation. It’s a difficult process that I don’t enjoy. I don’t harbor animosity against friends and family members who do not like their loved one being asked hard questions. Civility is a two-way street, and I’m prepared to do my best to be dignified and civil.”

Different Senate committees will hold individual confirmation hearings on Green’s other nominees. It’s unclear whether the hopes of civility by Abercrombie and Keohokalole will come to fruition, said Colin Moore, director of the University of Hawaii’s Public Policy Center.

“Gov. Abercrombie knows his behavior was wrong,” Moore said. “But it goes to show that the atmosphere is very tense around these confirmations. We’re coming up on some others that can be tense as well,” such as Green’s appointees for attorney general and the head of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources.

Moore said the Senate is “not going to be a rubber stamp.”

For nominees, he said, “you are really putting yourself out there for public scrutiny. Any negative things you’ve done in your career are going to come out.”",2023-02-19 06:21:28

2625,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, rain, love",Efficiently using a heat pump in a high rise,"Had a bit of a life change recently and I'm befuddled by modern amenities. I've always lived in older crappy ground-floor apartments with window A/C \*at best\* and my usual methods for saving on a power bill seem wrong. I usually run the A/C when it's hot and turn it off / open the windows when it's cooler. I'll jack the temperature higher during the day if we're not home so the system doesn't work as hard to keep things cool.

For heat pumps, the guidance seems to be ""[set it and forget it](https://www.efficiencymaine.com/heat-pump-user-tip-set-it-and-forget-it/)"" but it still feels pretty weird to open the windows with the unit on. We've been maintaining a temperature of 75f with the fan on auto. We open the windows when we wake up (usually 5am) and close them when the outside temp reaches 75 (usually 10am). The unit stays on blowing a very small amount of colder air into the room even when the temperature is lower than 75. This is way different than the window or portable units that have the compressor kicking on and off as it reaches the temperature threshold.

Another thing that may be specific to a high rise: we love the night time temperature in Hawaii and usually slept with windows open and fans going. Doesn't seem to work in a taller building for whatever reason. Last weekend, the outside temp dropped below 75 pretty quickly after the sun went down but despite all the windows open and fans going, the interior of our apartment never got below 80 and was pretty hot/humid when we woke up in the morning. My theory is that the exterior of the building was still warmed from the sun and we caught the rising heat in our windows instead of fresh air.

The remotes and distributors are Carrier branded, the heat pump itself on my lanai is unbranded.

I'm not trying to desperately min/max my power bill but just trying to be efficient while getting as much fresh air outside as possible. Any advice from folks who have a similar setup would be greatly appreciated :)",2023-01-27 17:12:39

Been told that I would regret getting rid of my Tundra but the truth is I don’t even take it off-roading and a Tesla would provide the same things that an ICE vehicle would give me. We don’t rent so I could install the Tesla charger at home. I guess my question is do you regret going electric or do you enjoy your EV?

Please remove if not allowed.

I've been doing a lot of activism for the senior renters and condo owners in my building, Honuakaha. We had a ""wastewater leak"" (our property manager said it was a sewage leak at a board meeting) in the parking garage that was unaddressed for two months, and it was tracked into the elevator/hallways/units by walkers and other assistive devices. My boyfriend goes out that way to walk the dogs and his feet were stained for 3 days following that flood. Many senior units are being affected by leaks and mold, we have unlicensed and unpermitted work going on, no money going into the AOAO reserves. On the condo side, we are repeatedly flooded during heavy rains and at one point a few years ago, the flooding was so bad that it was coming down the elevator shaft and into the cab (this same elevator has now been non-functioning for close to 6 months).

HCDA is not only the developer for the building, but also our neighbor, the owner of the senior rental units, and make up 3/5 of our AOAO board. The last two parts are really messed up because they were delinquent \~$800k toward the AOAO two years ago and never addressed why or how, just gave themselves a loan from their revolving funds to pay it back. 

I've tried reaching out to DOH about the issues and they say it's not in their jurisdiction, so I went to the EPA, who said the same thing. I've gone to basically about everyone I could possibly go to, and it seems that no department or agency wants to help, so I've been reaching out to other grassroots organizers to help spread the word and provide some guidance. I've even reached out to the local and federal HUD offices + the OIG to report the conditions and possible Section 8 fraud, and they all say they can't help. Our legislators (Senator Moriwaki, Speaker Saiki, CM Dos Santos-Tam) have basically held several town hall meetings with residents that just leaves us more upset and don't actually address any of our issues, and the meetings are more of a venue for them and the HCDA to assuage us with flowery language and take photos for their social media and newsletters.

We are having a protest this week to bring awareness and show our area legislators and the HCDA that we are not happy with the way things are going and that it shouldn't take constant rallying and bad press to get them to act. I've tried reaching out to other legislators and the only person who took the time to respond was Rep. Pierick, so I'm reaching out here as well to try and reach a bigger audience.",2023-06-06 17:53:45

But the incident also raises expectations about how Green’s other controversial nominees may be treated in their own separate confirmation hearings.

A “humbled” Abercrombie called his outburst “regretful and unfortunate” and said he hopes that it will help turn down the temperature around Anderson’s successor and other Cabinet appointees.

“Everybody has something to learn,” Abercrombie said. “Hopefully, ironically, I hope a cooler and calmer atmosphere will prevail and the personality drama disappears. I was grateful for his (Keohokalole’s) graciousness.”

Both Keohokalole and Abercrombie acknowledged the emotion and passion around helping Home Lands beneficiaries and hope to focus on that mission.

“Our eyes should be on the prize,” Abercrombie said.

Keohokalole said, “I accept his apology and want to move on. I do not hold against anyone the animosity that’s generated when we in the Senate are critical of people that they love when they are up for vetting and confirmation. It’s a difficult process that I don’t enjoy. I don’t harbor animosity against friends and family members who do not like their loved one being asked hard questions. Civility is a two-way street, and I’m prepared to do my best to be dignified and civil.”

Different Senate committees will hold individual confirmation hearings on Green’s other nominees. It’s unclear whether the hopes of civility by Abercrombie and Keohokalole will come to fruition, said Colin Moore, director of the University of Hawaii’s Public Policy Center.

“Gov. Abercrombie knows his behavior was wrong,” Moore said. “But it goes to show that the atmosphere is very tense around these confirmations. We’re coming up on some others that can be tense as well,” such as Green’s appointees for attorney general and the head of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources.

Moore said the Senate is “not going to be a rubber stamp.”

For nominees, he said, “you are really putting yourself out there for public scrutiny. Any negative things you’ve done in your career are going to come out.”",2023-02-19 06:21:28

When I was 6 or 8, Ball Lightning struck my house (Orchid Land, Puna, Big Island 1980’s).  My mom & younger sister along with myself all witnessed it.  It was during a lightning storm, we were enjoying the loud rain on our tin roof, when we noticed a glow from outside.  We all turned to the window and saw the Ball hovering just outside the window.  It then exploded with the loudest bang, leaving no damage to the house or evidence of what just happened.  We all ran into my parents bedroom in shock. I now live in Kawaihae on the Big Island.

Gov. Josh Green has urged state senators to treat his Cabinet nominees with courtesy and respect, but some senators say it goes both ways after one was called an “idiot” by no less than former Gov. Neil Abercrombie at this week’s confirmation hearing for Ikaika Anderson.

Abercrombie told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that he apologized to state Sen. Jarrett Keohokalole by telephone Friday for calling Keohokalole “an idiot” while seated in the front row of Tuesday’s hearing on Anderson to run the state Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.

Keohokalole told the Star-Advertiser that he accepted Abercrombie’s apology, and both said they hope to move on.

The name-calling of a sitting senator by a former governor in a public hearing, however, underscores the tensions, emotions and pressure around some of Green’s 20 Cabinet appointees and their deputies as Green begins the search for another nominee to run DHHL after Anderson withdrew his name from consideration following the contentious hearing.

DHHL is under incredible public pressure to develop a plan to spend a record $600 million in state funding to help clear the waitlist of 28,000 Hawaiians across the state who have been promised homes.

Keohokalole (D, Kaneohe- Kailua) and state Sen. Les Ihara (D, Palolo-Kaimuki- Moiliili) both voted against recommending Anderson’s confirmation following the five-hour hearing of the Senate Committee on Hawaiian Affairs.

Ihara stood on the floor of the Senate the day after Anderson’s hearing and condemned Abercrombie’s behavior without naming either him or Keohokalole.

Instead, Ihara said that a “former governor” had called out a senator.

“He called him an idiot,” Ihara said. Senate rules ask “that we stand up to protect visitors and senators to this Capitol building from indignities to our humanity.”

The name-calling of a sitting senator by a former governor in a public hearing, however, underscores the tensions, emotions and pressure around some of Green’s 20 Cabinet appointees and their deputies as Green begins the search for another nominee to run DHHL after Anderson withdrew his name from consideration following the contentious hearing.

DHHL is under incredible public pressure to develop a plan to spend a record $600 million in state funding to help clear the waitlist of 28,000 Hawaiians across the state who have been promised homes.

Keohokalole (D, Kaneohe- Kailua) and state Sen. Les Ihara (D, Palolo-Kaimuki- Moiliili) both voted against recommending Anderson’s confirmation following the five-hour hearing of the Senate Committee on Hawaiian Affairs.

Ihara stood on the floor of the Senate the day after Anderson’s hearing and condemned Abercrombie’s behavior without naming either him or Keohokalole.

Instead, Ihara said that a “former governor” had called out a senator.

“He called him an idiot,” Ihara said. Senate rules ask “that we stand up to protect visitors and senators to this Capitol building from indignities to our humanity.”

Abercrombie considers Anderson his “son,” and Keohokalole said he would expect that his family and friends would be just as passionate in defending him.

But the incident also raises expectations about how Green’s other controversial nominees may be treated in their own separate confirmation hearings.

A “humbled” Abercrombie called his outburst “regretful and unfortunate” and said he hopes that it will help turn down the temperature around Anderson’s successor and other Cabinet appointees.

“Everybody has something to learn,” Abercrombie said. “Hopefully, ironically, I hope a cooler and calmer atmosphere will prevail and the personality drama disappears. I was grateful for his (Keohokalole’s) graciousness.”

Both Keohokalole and Abercrombie acknowledged the emotion and passion around helping Home Lands beneficiaries and hope to focus on that mission.

“Our eyes should be on the prize,” Abercrombie said.

Keohokalole said, “I accept his apology and want to move on. I do not hold against anyone the animosity that’s generated when we in the Senate are critical of people that they love when they are up for vetting and confirmation. It’s a difficult process that I don’t enjoy. I don’t harbor animosity against friends and family members who do not like their loved one being asked hard questions. Civility is a two-way street, and I’m prepared to do my best to be dignified and civil.”

Different Senate committees will hold individual confirmation hearings on Green’s other nominees. It’s unclear whether the hopes of civility by Abercrombie and Keohokalole will come to fruition, said Colin Moore, director of the University of Hawaii’s Public Policy Center.

“Gov. Abercrombie knows his behavior was wrong,” Moore said. “But it goes to show that the atmosphere is very tense around these confirmations. We’re coming up on some others that can be tense as well,” such as Green’s appointees for attorney general and the head of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources.

Moore said the Senate is “not going to be a rubber stamp.”

For nominees, he said, “you are really putting yourself out there for public scrutiny. Any negative things you’ve done in your career are going to come out.”",2023-02-19 06:21:28
2657,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, drizzle, love",Efficiently using a heat pump in a high rise,"Had a bit of a life change recently and I'm befuddled by modern amenities. I've always lived in older crappy ground-floor apartments with window A/C \*at best\* and my usual methods for saving on a power bill seem wrong. I usually run the A/C when it's hot and turn it off / open the windows when it's cooler. I'll jack the temperature higher during the day if we're not home so the system doesn't work as hard to keep things cool.

For heat pumps, the guidance seems to be ""[set it and forget it](https://www.efficiencymaine.com/heat-pump-user-tip-set-it-and-forget-it/)"" but it still feels pretty weird to open the windows with the unit on. We've been maintaining a temperature of 75f with the fan on auto. We open the windows when we wake up (usually 5am) and close them when the outside temp reaches 75 (usually 10am). The unit stays on blowing a very small amount of colder air into the room even when the temperature is lower than 75. This is way different than the window or portable units that have the compressor kicking on and off as it reaches the temperature threshold.

Another thing that may be specific to a high rise: we love the night time temperature in Hawaii and usually slept with windows open and fans going. Doesn't seem to work in a taller building for whatever reason. Last weekend, the outside temp dropped below 75 pretty quickly after the sun went down but despite all the windows open and fans going, the interior of our apartment never got below 80 and was pretty hot/humid when we woke up in the morning. My theory is that the exterior of the building was still warmed from the sun and we caught the rising heat in our windows instead of fresh air.

The remotes and distributors are Carrier branded, the heat pump itself on my lanai is unbranded.

I'm not trying to desperately min/max my power bill but just trying to be efficient while getting as much fresh air outside as possible. Any advice from folks who have a similar setup would be greatly appreciated :)",2023-01-27 17:12:39
