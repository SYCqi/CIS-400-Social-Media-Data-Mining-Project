1,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.
 
I‚Äôm curious what you all have to say.",2024-06-12 14:37:32+00:00

3,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",Just did a great work trip through Florida! What a cool state.,"Hello Floridians of Reddit!

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I‚Äôm 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami‚Äôs airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! üëÄ wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I‚Äôve ever been too, and I‚Äôve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I‚Äôve ever experienced; and I‚Äôve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I‚Äôm going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I‚Äôm heading to Tampa which I‚Äôm very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! üòã

Anywho, just wanted to holler and tell you how cool I thought this state was, not being in the touristy Orlando spots. I hope to come down here and go camping in panther country some day. I had no idea panther crossing were a real thing before today?! I‚Äôm just blown away with how much there is to do, and eat down here‚Äìit‚Äôs endless! What a cool f‚Äôn place. It was 35* and snowing when I left Utah. Y‚Äôall have it to good!",2023-03-23 21:46:57+00:00
4,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",To everyone complaining about wanting to or thinking about leaving Florida‚Ä¶.,"I want you to realize that hurricanes are normal. Part of life here in Florida always has been always will be. Yes, they are getting worse. Yes, we should be more prepared now than ever. Yes we‚Äôre gonna see more destruction. But I‚Äôll tell you this. Anywhere you go is going to be worse and worse and worse with the weather. Whether you‚Äôre in a blizzard and snowed in for a week without power in freezing frigid temperatures. Or you‚Äôre in the mountains and you get flash flooding or you‚Äôre in a state with immense wild fires or you‚Äôre in Florida and you get a Hurricane the weather is getting more brutal everywhere.

Hurricanes are a part of Florida life. If you can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt, or don‚Äôt want to handle it when those situations arise, you should definitely consider leaving, but I heed you this warning. Extreme weather can happen anywhere and it‚Äôs happening more and more.

Make the decision that‚Äôs best for you and your family but asking 1000 times on 1000 different posts on Reddit isn‚Äôt gonna help the situation.

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing.

I feel like we are not taking care of Florida. We are changing it into something unenjoyable. I feel like some people are caught up in making Florida ""theirs"", when in reality, Florida is for not just one. Florida is a piece of land that is extremely diverse in plants and animals. Florida is for observation only.

17,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",Has anybody here actually left Florida? Where did you end up moving and did you like it?,"Not sure what other subreddit to post this one, so if you know a better subreddit, let me know.

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

But I have this fear, it always seems like everybody is talking about leaving Florida, but they never seem to actually do it.  Furthermore, people who do, it often seems like they end up back in short time.  One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.  

So what I am asking here, is there any success stories from former Floridians who moved away and loved it? Or just anybody who can share some experiences? I deeply fear falling into the ""grass is greener"" trap, but then finding out the grass is yellow everywhere.  But I do feel like in my heart of hearts deep down I should relocate before my mental sanity flies off the handle in extremely crowded and busy area I live.",2023-04-30 17:30:36+00:00

21,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",Californian visiting Florida for the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù and it was‚Ä¶ great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I‚Äôm not moving to Florida. I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

35,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",Thinking about moving to Florida from Montana.,"Don't get me wrong, Montana is an absolutely gorgeous state with views that don't compare to many other places. However, I was born and raised in Florida, moved out of the state almost a decade ago now and every year I think about moving back but I am afraid of only being drawn back by nostalgia. I was raised in Pasco County, to give you an idea of where I'm from. I had no choice but to move, seeing as I was a minor at the time but now that I am financially stable and have nothing tying me down I've been toying with the idea to move back. I hate the winters, the snow is absolutely awful and just this last week it was -38 here in Montana. I have no love for snow sports, I love the heat and the humidity is something I'm used to. I would much rather do warm activities such as exploring, boating, hiking, and things of that nature. 

The main reason I want to move back to Florida is all my siblings live there with their kids, I am very family oriented and want to be involved in their lives. I know it's gotten far more expensive to live, but I am also moving from a place where a 1bd/1bath costs about 2,000$ a month. Car insurance here is cheap but car registration is not. Food prices are insane, but gas prices are low currently. Not to mention, the harsh conditions of the roads and the snow causes ware and tear on your vehicle. Within two months of living in Montana I had accumulated two cracks in my windshield and I stay far behind others while driving. All this to say, I am not very happy here.  Also Montana is very isolated with their cities, you have to drive at least two hours to get to another 'big' city. I like populated areas, being in the city. Yada yada. 

I've lived in Saint Louis, Detroit, and now a rinky-dink town in Montana so I am no stranger to extremely populated areas with high crime rates, low pay, and extremely populated areas.

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating. I'd be giving up everything I love, even down to the food, weather, and geography.

45,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, hate",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

Hurricanes are a part of Florida life. If you can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt, or don‚Äôt want to handle it when those situations arise, you should definitely consider leaving, but I heed you this warning. Extreme weather can happen anywhere and it‚Äôs happening more and more.

Nice to see some justice in our country again and helping me look at the better side of things.  I've been so focused on my disgust of DeSantis and the policy makers here, the school board in Sarasota where my children go to school and so on that I've stopped taking time to appreciate some of the special things about Florida that I love.  So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

Im not trying to paint this as a left or right thing, I identify as socially left and economically right, so I am  not taking a side here. but seriously yall need to appreciate what you have that us in other states (CA, NC,SC) dont have at all.

I understand some of yall dont like desantis and dont like his social policy, fair enough (although that new alimony law should have won some of you socially left people over, alimony is a patriarchal construct in the first place)

The main reason I want to move back to Florida is all my siblings live there with their kids, I am very family oriented and want to be involved in their lives. I know it's gotten far more expensive to live, but I am also moving from a place where a 1bd/1bath costs about 2,000$ a month. Car insurance here is cheap but car registration is not. Food prices are insane, but gas prices are low currently. Not to mention, the harsh conditions of the roads and the snow causes ware and tear on your vehicle. Within two months of living in Montana I had accumulated two cracks in my windshield and I stay far behind others while driving. All this to say, I am not very happy here.  Also Montana is very isolated with their cities, you have to drive at least two hours to get to another 'big' city. I like populated areas, being in the city. Yada yada. 

I've lived in Saint Louis, Detroit, and now a rinky-dink town in Montana so I am no stranger to extremely populated areas with high crime rates, low pay, and extremely populated areas. 

For those of you who were born in Florida, left and then came back, was it something you regretted or were you drawn back and enjoying it?  ",2024-01-18 19:44:01+00:00

67,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, hate",Just did a great work trip through Florida! What a cool state.,"Hello Floridians of Reddit!

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I‚Äôm 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami‚Äôs airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! üëÄ wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I‚Äôve ever been too, and I‚Äôve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I‚Äôve ever experienced; and I‚Äôve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I‚Äôm going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I‚Äôm heading to Tampa which I‚Äôm very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! üòã

Anywho, just wanted to holler and tell you how cool I thought this state was, not being in the touristy Orlando spots. I hope to come down here and go camping in panther country some day. I had no idea panther crossing were a real thing before today?! I‚Äôm just blown away with how much there is to do, and eat down here‚Äìit‚Äôs endless! What a cool f‚Äôn place. It was 35* and snowing when I left Utah. Y‚Äôall have it to good!",2023-03-23 21:46:57+00:00

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating. I'd be giving up everything I love, even down to the food, weather, and geography.

71,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

72,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06+00:00

Florida is essentially developed swampland, sure but Florida has a desirable climate, low taxes, and lots of corporations are moving here. Home prices here have gone up FASTER than the average ever since the invention of home air conditioning, florida has always had more inflow for most of y‚Äôall‚Äôs lives, for a reason.

1. Terrible housing market (the low end for houses is $1M)
2. High Income Taxes
3. Terrible weather - hate the winter
4. No job opportunities

79,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, enjoy",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec.

This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

Hurricanes are a part of Florida life. If you can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt, or don‚Äôt want to handle it when those situations arise, you should definitely consider leaving, but I heed you this warning. Extreme weather can happen anywhere and it‚Äôs happening more and more.

Make the decision that‚Äôs best for you and your family but asking 1000 times on 1000 different posts on Reddit isn‚Äôt gonna help the situation.

81,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, enjoy",What has happened to Florida?,"I grew up in FL and moved away when I was 20. While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous. 

What happened to Florida? Its literally become the playground for the far right. I dont even associate it with Publix, alligators, oranges, beaches, dolphins and Jimmy Buffett music anymore.",2023-07-03 14:00:21+00:00

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19+00:00

89,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, enjoy",Californian visiting Florida for the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù and it was‚Ä¶ great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I‚Äôm not moving to Florida. I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

94,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, enjoy",Thinking about moving to Florida from Montana.,"Don't get me wrong, Montana is an absolutely gorgeous state with views that don't compare to many other places. However, I was born and raised in Florida, moved out of the state almost a decade ago now and every year I think about moving back but I am afraid of only being drawn back by nostalgia. I was raised in Pasco County, to give you an idea of where I'm from. I had no choice but to move, seeing as I was a minor at the time but now that I am financially stable and have nothing tying me down I've been toying with the idea to move back. I hate the winters, the snow is absolutely awful and just this last week it was -38 here in Montana. I have no love for snow sports, I love the heat and the humidity is something I'm used to. I would much rather do warm activities such as exploring, boating, hiking, and things of that nature. 

The main reason I want to move back to Florida is all my siblings live there with their kids, I am very family oriented and want to be involved in their lives. I know it's gotten far more expensive to live, but I am also moving from a place where a 1bd/1bath costs about 2,000$ a month. Car insurance here is cheap but car registration is not. Food prices are insane, but gas prices are low currently. Not to mention, the harsh conditions of the roads and the snow causes ware and tear on your vehicle. Within two months of living in Montana I had accumulated two cracks in my windshield and I stay far behind others while driving. All this to say, I am not very happy here.  Also Montana is very isolated with their cities, you have to drive at least two hours to get to another 'big' city. I like populated areas, being in the city. Yada yada. 

I've lived in Saint Louis, Detroit, and now a rinky-dink town in Montana so I am no stranger to extremely populated areas with high crime rates, low pay, and extremely populated areas.

95,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, enjoy",Just did a great work trip through Florida! What a cool state.,"Hello Floridians of Reddit!

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I‚Äôm 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami‚Äôs airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! üëÄ wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I‚Äôve ever been too, and I‚Äôve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I‚Äôve ever experienced; and I‚Äôve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I‚Äôm going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I‚Äôm heading to Tampa which I‚Äôm very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! üòã

Anywho, just wanted to holler and tell you how cool I thought this state was, not being in the touristy Orlando spots. I hope to come down here and go camping in panther country some day. I had no idea panther crossing were a real thing before today?! I‚Äôm just blown away with how much there is to do, and eat down here‚Äìit‚Äôs endless! What a cool f‚Äôn place.

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating.

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

Basically, I am a graduating engineer in Southern Ontario (near Toronto) and I'm unable to find a job here due to the job market.

Reasons why I want to leave Canada:

1. Terrible housing market (the low end for houses is $1M)
2. High Income Taxes
3. Terrible weather - hate the winter
4. No job opportunities

I am looking for a place where I can move with my gf (who is studying to be a dentist) to start a family. More specifically, a family friendly neighborhood.

I've visited Florida (Tampa) last August and I really loved it. Enjoyed the weather, talked to many locals who were very nice and welcoming. From my experience, Florida seems like the place to go.

I'd only be able to move there by getting a TN visa from a work sponsorship. 

My questions to you are:

1. What are the biggest cons that I might face for a person in my position?
2. What city/region would you recommend for me to move to?
3. Do you think there's another state that would better suit me?",2023-04-24 22:05:38+00:00

I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South.

I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami‚Äôs airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! üëÄ wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I‚Äôve ever been too, and I‚Äôve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I‚Äôve ever experienced; and I‚Äôve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I‚Äôm going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I‚Äôm heading to Tampa which I‚Äôm very excited about.

Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19+00:00

However, I was born and raised in Florida, moved out of the state almost a decade ago now and every year I think about moving back but I am afraid of only being drawn back by nostalgia. I was raised in Pasco County, to give you an idea of where I'm from. I had no choice but to move, seeing as I was a minor at the time but now that I am financially stable and have nothing tying me down I've been toying with the idea to move back. I hate the winters, the snow is absolutely awful and just this last week it was -38 here in Montana. I have no love for snow sports, I love the heat and the humidity is something I'm used to. I would much rather do warm activities such as exploring, boating, hiking, and things of that nature. 

The main reason I want to move back to Florida is all my siblings live there with their kids, I am very family oriented and want to be involved in their lives. I know it's gotten far more expensive to live, but I am also moving from a place where a 1bd/1bath costs about 2,000$ a month. Car insurance here is cheap but car registration is not. Food prices are insane, but gas prices are low currently. Not to mention, the harsh conditions of the roads and the snow causes ware and tear on your vehicle. Within two months of living in Montana I had accumulated two cracks in my windshield and I stay far behind others while driving. All this to say, I am not very happy here.  Also Montana is very isolated with their cities, you have to drive at least two hours to get to another 'big' city. I like populated areas, being in the city. Yada yada. 

I've lived in Saint Louis, Detroit, and now a rinky-dink town in Montana so I am no stranger to extremely populated areas with high crime rates, low pay, and extremely populated areas.

158,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, happy",Just did a great work trip through Florida! What a cool state.,"Hello Floridians of Reddit!

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I‚Äôm 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami‚Äôs airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! üëÄ wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I‚Äôve ever been too, and I‚Äôve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I‚Äôve ever experienced; and I‚Äôve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I‚Äôm going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I‚Äôm heading to Tampa which I‚Äôm very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! üòã

Anywho, just wanted to holler and tell you how cool I thought this state was, not being in the touristy Orlando spots. I hope to come down here and go camping in panther country some day. I had no idea panther crossing were a real thing before today?! I‚Äôm just blown away with how much there is to do, and eat down here‚Äìit‚Äôs endless! What a cool f‚Äôn place. It was 35* and snowing when I left Utah. Y‚Äôall have it to good!",2023-03-23 21:46:57+00:00
159,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, happy",Happy Hurricane Season!,"Hurricane season starts June 1, and this one will be a doozy.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03+00:00
160,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US ‚Äì all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07+00:00

163,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‚ÄòDial *FHP for emergency‚Äô.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‚Äòsoon‚Äô.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it‚Äôs not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can‚Äôt see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‚Äòescorting‚Äô a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‚Äòwide load‚Äô sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm‚Ä¶) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while‚Ä¶. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, ‚ÄúNow that you‚Äôve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?‚Äù  The response: ‚ÄúSir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.‚Äù I‚Äôll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy‚Äôs awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don‚Äôt need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‚Äòfund raiser mode‚Äô, but the time I actually need one?

BTW- the inside of a lighting bolt is bright yellow.",2023-08-06 19:47:46+00:00

I‚Äôve never been shown a greater amount of disrespect by the general public than on a bicycle. Nobody yields, nobody gives space, people will purposely vroom past you, it seriously felt like I was vilified by society like I was some murderer.

No i wasn‚Äôt one of those annoying bicyclists that ride in the middle of the road or one that has a chip on their shoulder. I‚Äôm 20 years old, riding my bike to the library or a friends house so I can go use the computer to do schoolwork because I can‚Äôt do it at home. I always rode on the sidewalk whenever possible but there‚Äôs sometimes no sidewalk. And I‚Äôve almost been hit a couple of times. Dead before I can legally drink because I don‚Äôt have a car was a wild thought. I will never ever ride a bike on public areas again.

I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami‚Äôs airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! üëÄ wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I‚Äôve ever been too, and I‚Äôve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I‚Äôve ever experienced; and I‚Äôve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I‚Äôm going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though!

But I‚Äôll tell you this. Anywhere you go is going to be worse and worse and worse with the weather. Whether you‚Äôre in a blizzard and snowed in for a week without power in freezing frigid temperatures. Or you‚Äôre in the mountains and you get flash flooding or you‚Äôre in a state with immense wild fires or you‚Äôre in Florida and you get a Hurricane the weather is getting more brutal everywhere.

Hurricanes are a part of Florida life. If you can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt, or don‚Äôt want to handle it when those situations arise, you should definitely consider leaving, but I heed you this warning. Extreme weather can happen anywhere and it‚Äôs happening more and more.

Make the decision that‚Äôs best for you and your family but asking 1000 times on 1000 different posts on Reddit isn‚Äôt gonna help the situation.

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing.

One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.  

So what I am asking here, is there any success stories from former Floridians who moved away and loved it? Or just anybody who can share some experiences? I deeply fear falling into the ""grass is greener"" trap, but then finding out the grass is yellow everywhere.  But I do feel like in my heart of hearts deep down I should relocate before my mental sanity flies off the handle in extremely crowded and busy area I live.",2023-04-30 17:30:36+00:00

201,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, love",Californian visiting Florida for the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù and it was‚Ä¶ great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I‚Äôm not moving to Florida. I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I‚Äôm 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami‚Äôs airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! üëÄ wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I‚Äôve ever been too, and I‚Äôve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I‚Äôve ever experienced; and I‚Äôve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I‚Äôm going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I‚Äôm heading to Tampa which I‚Äôm very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! üòã

Anywho, just wanted to holler and tell you how cool I thought this state was, not being in the touristy Orlando spots. I hope to come down here and go camping in panther country some day.

221,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, love",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

1. **If you had resources to help during a disaster (like a truck, extra room, etc.), would incentives motivate you to help others evacuate?**
2. **What types of incentives do you think would encourage people in your community to step up in times of crisis?**
3. **What barriers would prevent you from helping others in a disaster situation?**
4. **What‚Äôs one thing you think your community could do better to be prepared for an emergency?**

Your feedback could help shape a new solution that empowers communities to be more resilient in the face of climate challenges. If you have personal stories, ideas, or thoughts on the incentives system, please drop a comment below!

The house has another neighbor, on dual quarter acre lots and that house has been there fifteen years and has above ground utilities.

When they met the neighbors they happened to mention that their house has been hit by lightning twice. I thought that was remarkable, they are pretty much inland. 

My sis just texted me that lightning hit her front yard. Dirt was tossed against the house and almost  broke a window. Their TVs are fried. And she said it was super crazy loud. I truly would have shit my pants.

So , on half an acre, that is three lightning strikes.

242,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, hate",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

Nice to see some justice in our country again and helping me look at the better side of things.  I've been so focused on my disgust of DeSantis and the policy makers here, the school board in Sarasota where my children go to school and so on that I've stopped taking time to appreciate some of the special things about Florida that I love.  So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

Im not trying to paint this as a left or right thing, I identify as socially left and economically right, so I am  not taking a side here. but seriously yall need to appreciate what you have that us in other states (CA, NC,SC) dont have at all.

I understand some of yall dont like desantis and dont like his social policy, fair enough (although that new alimony law should have won some of you socially left people over, alimony is a patriarchal construct in the first place)

256,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

257,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06+00:00

While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous. 

What happened to Florida? Its literally become the playground for the far right. I dont even associate it with Publix, alligators, oranges, beaches, dolphins and Jimmy Buffett music anymore.",2023-07-03 14:00:21+00:00

We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside!

265,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, enjoy",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon.

I have visited once in April (or February or March I can't remember, it was a family trip when I was a kid)  and then the weather was lovely.

Does it rain all day every day with cloudy skies or what does it look like?

We plan on mainly visiting beaches, swimming, reading, enjoying the sun, laying by the pool etc. with maybe some day trips to maybe a botanical garden, maybe disney and such. But mainly the beach. We would also like to go on a Caribbean Cruise for one week.

Please give me some advice! I would really like to go to Florida but maybe it's better to visit some other time of year?

EDIT: Can add that we are thinking about maybe Key West and that we are from Sweden so if it rains where we are from it will usually rain all day long. And 22-25 degrees celsius is warm for us.",2024-01-19 14:28:44+00:00

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03+00:00
299,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US ‚Äì all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago.

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‚Äòsoon‚Äô.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it‚Äôs not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can‚Äôt see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‚Äòescorting‚Äô a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‚Äòwide load‚Äô sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm‚Ä¶) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while‚Ä¶. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, ‚ÄúNow that you‚Äôve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?‚Äù  The response: ‚ÄúSir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.‚Äù I‚Äôll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy‚Äôs awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don‚Äôt need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‚Äòfund raiser mode‚Äô, but the time I actually need one?

I‚Äôve never been shown a greater amount of disrespect by the general public than on a bicycle. Nobody yields, nobody gives space, people will purposely vroom past you, it seriously felt like I was vilified by society like I was some murderer.

305,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, love",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

But I have this fear, it always seems like everybody is talking about leaving Florida, but they never seem to actually do it.  Furthermore, people who do, it often seems like they end up back in short time.  One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.  

So what I am asking here, is there any success stories from former Floridians who moved away and loved it? Or just anybody who can share some experiences?

316,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, love",Californian visiting Florida for the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù and it was‚Ä¶ great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I‚Äôm not moving to Florida. I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I‚Äôm 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami‚Äôs airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! üëÄ wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I‚Äôve ever been too, and I‚Äôve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive!

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating. I'd be giving up everything I love, even down to the food, weather, and geography.

336,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, love",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

When extreme weather events hit‚Äîfloods, hurricanes, wildfires‚Äîevacuations and rescues become critical, but sometimes, resources and helping hands are limited. We're exploring ideas to strengthen our communities and would love to hear from you.

**The Concept:** Imagine a community where, in times of disaster, those with the means (vehicles, boats, safe spaces) not only ensure their own evacuation but also assist others in need. This support wouldn‚Äôt just be voluntary; there would be incentives‚Äîthings like tax breaks, gift cards, or community points that could be redeemed for local benefits.

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **If you had resources to help during a disaster (like a truck, extra room, etc.), would incentives motivate you to help others evacuate?**
2. **What types of incentives do you think would encourage people in your community to step up in times of crisis?**
3. **What barriers would prevent you from helping others in a disaster situation?**
4. **What‚Äôs one thing you think your community could do better to be prepared for an emergency?**

Your feedback could help shape a new solution that empowers communities to be more resilient in the face of climate challenges. If you have personal stories, ideas, or thoughts on the incentives system, please drop a comment below!

Basically, I am a graduating engineer in Southern Ontario (near Toronto) and I'm unable to find a job here due to the job market.

Reasons why I want to leave Canada:

1. Terrible housing market (the low end for houses is $1M)
2. High Income Taxes
3. Terrible weather - hate the winter
4. No job opportunities

I am looking for a place where I can move with my gf (who is studying to be a dentist) to start a family. More specifically, a family friendly neighborhood.

I've visited Florida (Tampa) last August and I really loved it. Enjoyed the weather, talked to many locals who were very nice and welcoming. From my experience, Florida seems like the place to go.

I'd only be able to move there by getting a TN visa from a work sponsorship.

356,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, hate",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

Nice to see some justice in our country again and helping me look at the better side of things.  I've been so focused on my disgust of DeSantis and the policy makers here, the school board in Sarasota where my children go to school and so on that I've stopped taking time to appreciate some of the special things about Florida that I love.  So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

freaking love it out there",2023-07-19 15:00:23+00:00

No income tax, wonderful destinations, plenty of jobs, yall have alot to be grateful for.  Id KILL for no income tax, thats literally a gift from god. Most people have to fight tooth and nail to evade taxes, but your government just hands it to you on a silver platter.

Im not trying to paint this as a left or right thing, I identify as socially left and economically right, so I am  not taking a side here. but seriously yall need to appreciate what you have that us in other states (CA, NC,SC) dont have at all.

I understand some of yall dont like desantis and dont like his social policy, fair enough (although that new alimony law should have won some of you socially left people over, alimony is a patriarchal construct in the first place)

372,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

373,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06+00:00

Basically, I am a graduating engineer in Southern Ontario (near Toronto) and I'm unable to find a job here due to the job market.

Reasons why I want to leave Canada:

1. Terrible housing market (the low end for houses is $1M)
2. High Income Taxes
3. Terrible weather - hate the winter
4. No job opportunities

I am looking for a place where I can move with my gf (who is studying to be a dentist) to start a family. More specifically, a family friendly neighborhood.

I've visited Florida (Tampa) last August and I really loved it. Enjoyed the weather, talked to many locals who were very nice and welcoming. From my experience, Florida seems like the place to go.

I'd only be able to move there by getting a TN visa from a work sponsorship.

1. What are the biggest cons that I might face for a person in my position?
2. What city/region would you recommend for me to move to?
3. Do you think there's another state that would better suit me?",2023-04-24 22:05:38+00:00
378,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, enjoy",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

379,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, enjoy",What has happened to Florida?,"I grew up in FL and moved away when I was 20. While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous. 

What happened to Florida? Its literally become the playground for the far right. I dont even associate it with Publix, alligators, oranges, beaches, dolphins and Jimmy Buffett music anymore.",2023-07-03 14:00:21+00:00

I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

I want to update you with my new plans to visit your country. I got very many tips in the open comments and also in the privates. Link to the post before below.

https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/s/zPy0XbmLln

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19+00:00

415,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, happy",Happy Hurricane Season!,"Hurricane season starts June 1, and this one will be a doozy.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03+00:00
416,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US ‚Äì all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07+00:00

418,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‚ÄòDial *FHP for emergency‚Äô.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‚Äòsoon‚Äô.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it‚Äôs not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can‚Äôt see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‚Äòescorting‚Äô a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‚Äòwide load‚Äô sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm‚Ä¶) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while‚Ä¶. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, ‚ÄúNow that you‚Äôve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?‚Äù  The response: ‚ÄúSir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.‚Äù I‚Äôll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy‚Äôs awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don‚Äôt need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‚Äòfund raiser mode‚Äô, but the time I actually need one?

BTW- the inside of a lighting bolt is bright yellow.",2023-08-06 19:47:46+00:00

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background?

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19+00:00

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

But I have this fear, it always seems like everybody is talking about leaving Florida, but they never seem to actually do it.  Furthermore, people who do, it often seems like they end up back in short time.  One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.  

So what I am asking here, is there any success stories from former Floridians who moved away and loved it? Or just anybody who can share some experiences? I deeply fear falling into the ""grass is greener"" trap, but then finding out the grass is yellow everywhere.

435,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, love",Californian visiting Florida for the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù and it was‚Ä¶ great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I‚Äôm not moving to Florida. I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I‚Äôm 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami‚Äôs airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! üëÄ wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I‚Äôve ever been too, and I‚Äôve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I‚Äôve ever experienced; and I‚Äôve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I‚Äôm going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I‚Äôm heading to Tampa which I‚Äôm very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! üòã

Anywho, just wanted to holler and tell you how cool I thought this state was, not being in the touristy Orlando spots. I hope to come down here and go camping in panther country some day.

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating. I'd be giving up everything I love, even down to the food, weather, and geography.

455,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, love",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

When extreme weather events hit‚Äîfloods, hurricanes, wildfires‚Äîevacuations and rescues become critical, but sometimes, resources and helping hands are limited. We're exploring ideas to strengthen our communities and would love to hear from you.

**The Concept:** Imagine a community where, in times of disaster, those with the means (vehicles, boats, safe spaces) not only ensure their own evacuation but also assist others in need. This support wouldn‚Äôt just be voluntary; there would be incentives‚Äîthings like tax breaks, gift cards, or community points that could be redeemed for local benefits.

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **If you had resources to help during a disaster (like a truck, extra room, etc.), would incentives motivate you to help others evacuate?**
2. **What types of incentives do you think would encourage people in your community to step up in times of crisis?**
3. **What barriers would prevent you from helping others in a disaster situation?**
4. **What‚Äôs one thing you think your community could do better to be prepared for an emergency?**

Your feedback could help shape a new solution that empowers communities to be more resilient in the face of climate challenges. If you have personal stories, ideas, or thoughts on the incentives system, please drop a comment below!

Basically, I am a graduating engineer in Southern Ontario (near Toronto) and I'm unable to find a job here due to the job market.

Reasons why I want to leave Canada:

1. Terrible housing market (the low end for houses is $1M)
2. High Income Taxes
3. Terrible weather - hate the winter
4. No job opportunities

I am looking for a place where I can move with my gf (who is studying to be a dentist) to start a family. More specifically, a family friendly neighborhood.

I've visited Florida (Tampa) last August and I really loved it. Enjoyed the weather, talked to many locals who were very nice and welcoming. From my experience, Florida seems like the place to go.

477,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, hate",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

freaking love it out there",2023-07-19 15:00:23+00:00

Im finishing 3 months this year in Silicon Valley for another internship.

I have to know, what is with all the hatred on this sub? Some of the common points I see when people are hating on Fl are 1) cost of living, 2) weather, 3) insurance companies leaving.

.....do you people realize all these things are like 10x worse in California?

cost of living, forget about it, insurance, forget about it, weather? how many years have these wildfires been happening?

For christs sake, you people have NO INCOME TAX!!!! Only a handful of states in the US have this privilege, and florida is the only one with good beaches. No income tax, wonderful destinations, plenty of jobs, yall have alot to be grateful for.  Id KILL for no income tax, thats literally a gift from god. Most people have to fight tooth and nail to evade taxes, but your government just hands it to you on a silver platter. Ive lived in florida, and ive lived in the sapphire blue toilet bowl on the other side of the country, trust me, Id take FL any day.

Im not trying to paint this as a left or right thing, I identify as socially left and economically right, so I am  not taking a side here. but seriously yall need to appreciate what you have that us in other states (CA, NC,SC) dont have at all.

I understand some of yall dont like desantis and dont like his social policy, fair enough (although that new alimony law should have won some of you socially left people over, alimony is a patriarchal construct in the first place)

but come on, what NON-SOCIAL (I repeat, NON-SOCIAL) policies do you have or not have in florida that you think california does better? as someone whos lived in both, Im genuinely curious

491,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

492,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings.

While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous. 

What happened to Florida? Its literally become the playground for the far right. I dont even associate it with Publix, alligators, oranges, beaches, dolphins and Jimmy Buffett music anymore.",2023-07-03 14:00:21+00:00

Thank you all for the help, i read everything and have been using the Google so much/alot. Many Floridians have message me privates and i got even more great tips about places to see, I am so happy!

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy. Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing. I will call the airport and bank in the morning, it is 00:34 here now and i cant wake Alfred.",2024-09-10 14:59:19+00:00

502,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, enjoy",Californian visiting Florida for the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù and it was‚Ä¶ great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I‚Äôm not moving to Florida. I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating.

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though.

533,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, happy",Happy Hurricane Season!,"Hurricane season starts June 1, and this one will be a doozy.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03+00:00
534,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US ‚Äì all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07+00:00

536,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‚ÄòDial *FHP for emergency‚Äô.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‚Äòsoon‚Äô.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it‚Äôs not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can‚Äôt see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‚Äòescorting‚Äô a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‚Äòwide load‚Äô sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm‚Ä¶) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while‚Ä¶. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, ‚ÄúNow that you‚Äôve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?‚Äù  The response: ‚ÄúSir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.‚Äù I‚Äôll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy‚Äôs awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don‚Äôt need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‚Äòfund raiser mode‚Äô, but the time I actually need one?

BTW- the inside of a lighting bolt is bright yellow.",2023-08-06 19:47:46+00:00

549,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, love",Has anybody here actually left Florida? Where did you end up moving and did you like it?,"Not sure what other subreddit to post this one, so if you know a better subreddit, let me know.

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

But I have this fear, it always seems like everybody is talking about leaving Florida, but they never seem to actually do it.  Furthermore, people who do, it often seems like they end up back in short time.  One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.  

So what I am asking here, is there any success stories from former Floridians who moved away and loved it? Or just anybody who can share some experiences? I deeply fear falling into the ""grass is greener"" trap, but then finding out the grass is yellow everywhere.  But I do feel like in my heart of hearts deep down I should relocate before my mental sanity flies off the handle in extremely crowded and busy area I live.",2023-04-30 17:30:36+00:00

552,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, love",Californian visiting Florida for the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù and it was‚Ä¶ great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I‚Äôm not moving to Florida. I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I‚Äôm 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami‚Äôs airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! üëÄ wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I‚Äôve ever been too, and I‚Äôve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I‚Äôve ever experienced; and I‚Äôve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I‚Äôm going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I‚Äôm heading to Tampa which I‚Äôm very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! üòã

Anywho, just wanted to holler and tell you how cool I thought this state was, not being in the touristy Orlando spots. I hope to come down here and go camping in panther country some day.

I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.

572,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, love",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

576,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, love",Please Help Us Understand How Communities Respond to Disasters!,"Hi Reddit! üëã We're participating in a hackathon focused on improving community resilience during natural disasters, and we need your insights! When extreme weather events hit‚Äîfloods, hurricanes, wildfires‚Äîevacuations and rescues become critical, but sometimes, resources and helping hands are limited. We're exploring ideas to strengthen our communities and would love to hear from you.

**The Concept:** Imagine a community where, in times of disaster, those with the means (vehicles, boats, safe spaces) not only ensure their own evacuation but also assist others in need. This support wouldn‚Äôt just be voluntary; there would be incentives‚Äîthings like tax breaks, gift cards, or community points that could be redeemed for local benefits.

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **If you had resources to help during a disaster (like a truck, extra room, etc.), would incentives motivate you to help others evacuate?**
2. **What types of incentives do you think would encourage people in your community to step up in times of crisis?**
3. **What barriers would prevent you from helping others in a disaster situation?**
4. **What‚Äôs one thing you think your community could do better to be prepared for an emergency?**

Your feedback could help shape a new solution that empowers communities to be more resilient in the face of climate challenges. If you have personal stories, ideas, or thoughts on the incentives system, please drop a comment below!

Hurricanes are a part of Florida life. If you can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt, or don‚Äôt want to handle it when those situations arise, you should definitely consider leaving, but I heed you this warning. Extreme weather can happen anywhere and it‚Äôs happening more and more.

594,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, hate",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

I've been so focused on my disgust of DeSantis and the policy makers here, the school board in Sarasota where my children go to school and so on that I've stopped taking time to appreciate some of the special things about Florida that I love.  So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

609,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06+00:00

Florida is essentially developed swampland, sure but Florida has a desirable climate, low taxes, and lots of corporations are moving here.

someone suggested i consider installing a mini-split for the garage instead of doing storage. my garage door is already insulated, although its not an impact door, if that matters.

Reasons why I want to leave Canada:

1. Terrible housing market (the low end for houses is $1M)
2. High Income Taxes
3. Terrible weather - hate the winter
4. No job opportunities

I've visited Florida (Tampa) last August and I really loved it. Enjoyed the weather, talked to many locals who were very nice and welcoming. From my experience, Florida seems like the place to go.

I'd only be able to move there by getting a TN visa from a work sponsorship.

616,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, enjoy",What has happened to Florida?,"I grew up in FL and moved away when I was 20. While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous. 

What happened to Florida? Its literally become the playground for the far right. I dont even associate it with Publix, alligators, oranges, beaches, dolphins and Jimmy Buffett music anymore.",2023-07-03 14:00:21+00:00

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

619,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, enjoy",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean.

I am considering the south of Georgia or north of Florida like Jacksonville, Gainesville, Ocala and may be Orlando too. We are not big fan of beach so definitely not considering any coastal areas.

We are in early 40s and considering buying a land (may be 2-4 ac lot) and get it constructed and use most of the portion in gardening and growing our own food.

Generally 2ac or more lots are available in outskirts of these cities. we like more of the rural communities and we might be Ok with this. Do we need to worry about security concerns in outskirts?

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating. I'd be giving up everything I love, even down to the food, weather, and geography.

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

2. High Income Taxes

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South.

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background?

658,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, happy",Happy Hurricane Season!,"Hurricane season starts June 1, and this one will be a doozy.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03+00:00
659,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US ‚Äì all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07+00:00

661,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‚ÄòDial *FHP for emergency‚Äô.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‚Äòsoon‚Äô.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it‚Äôs not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can‚Äôt see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‚Äòescorting‚Äô a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‚Äòwide load‚Äô sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm‚Ä¶) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while‚Ä¶. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, ‚ÄúNow that you‚Äôve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?‚Äù  The response: ‚ÄúSir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.‚Äù I‚Äôll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy‚Äôs awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don‚Äôt need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‚Äòfund raiser mode‚Äô, but the time I actually need one?

Many thanks again!!

I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities.

I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I‚Äôm 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami‚Äôs airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! üëÄ wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I‚Äôve ever been too, and I‚Äôve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I‚Äôve ever experienced; and I‚Äôve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I‚Äôm going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I‚Äôm heading to Tampa which I‚Äôm very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! üòã

Anywho, just wanted to holler and tell you how cool I thought this state was, not being in the touristy Orlando spots. I hope to come down here and go camping in panther country some day. I had no idea panther crossing were a real thing before today?! I‚Äôm just blown away with how much there is to do, and eat down here‚Äìit‚Äôs endless! What a cool f‚Äôn place.

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating.

701,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, love",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

When extreme weather events hit‚Äîfloods, hurricanes, wildfires‚Äîevacuations and rescues become critical, but sometimes, resources and helping hands are limited. We're exploring ideas to strengthen our communities and would love to hear from you.

**The Concept:** Imagine a community where, in times of disaster, those with the means (vehicles, boats, safe spaces) not only ensure their own evacuation but also assist others in need. This support wouldn‚Äôt just be voluntary; there would be incentives‚Äîthings like tax breaks, gift cards, or community points that could be redeemed for local benefits.

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **If you had resources to help during a disaster (like a truck, extra room, etc.), would incentives motivate you to help others evacuate?**
2. **What types of incentives do you think would encourage people in your community to step up in times of crisis?**
3. **What barriers would prevent you from helping others in a disaster situation?**
4. **What‚Äôs one thing you think your community could do better to be prepared for an emergency?**

Basically, I am a graduating engineer in Southern Ontario (near Toronto) and I'm unable to find a job here due to the job market.

Reasons why I want to leave Canada:

1. Terrible housing market (the low end for houses is $1M)
2. High Income Taxes
3. Terrible weather - hate the winter
4. No job opportunities

I am looking for a place where I can move with my gf (who is studying to be a dentist) to start a family. More specifically, a family friendly neighborhood.

I'd only be able to move there by getting a TN visa from a work sponsorship.

723,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, hate",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

I've been so focused on my disgust of DeSantis and the policy makers here, the school board in Sarasota where my children go to school and so on that I've stopped taking time to appreciate some of the special things about Florida that I love.  So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

Im not trying to paint this as a left or right thing, I identify as socially left and economically right, so I am  not taking a side here. but seriously yall need to appreciate what you have that us in other states (CA, NC,SC) dont have at all.

I understand some of yall dont like desantis and dont like his social policy, fair enough (although that new alimony law should have won some of you socially left people over, alimony is a patriarchal construct in the first place)

737,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

738,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings.

While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous. 

What happened to Florida? Its literally become the playground for the far right. I dont even associate it with Publix, alligators, oranges, beaches, dolphins and Jimmy Buffett music anymore.",2023-07-03 14:00:21+00:00

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon.

I have visited once in April (or February or March I can't remember, it was a family trip when I was a kid)  and then the weather was lovely.

Does it rain all day every day with cloudy skies or what does it look like?

We plan on mainly visiting beaches, swimming, reading, enjoying the sun, laying by the pool etc. with maybe some day trips to maybe a botanical garden, maybe disney and such. But mainly the beach. We would also like to go on a Caribbean Cruise for one week.

Please give me some advice! I would really like to go to Florida but maybe it's better to visit some other time of year?

EDIT: Can add that we are thinking about maybe Key West and that we are from Sweden so if it rains where we are from it will usually rain all day long. And 22-25 degrees celsius is warm for us.",2024-01-19 14:28:44+00:00

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03+00:00
780,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US ‚Äì all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago.

782,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‚ÄòDial *FHP for emergency‚Äô.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‚Äòsoon‚Äô.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it‚Äôs not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can‚Äôt see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‚Äòescorting‚Äô a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‚Äòwide load‚Äô sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm‚Ä¶) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while‚Ä¶. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, ‚ÄúNow that you‚Äôve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?‚Äù  The response: ‚ÄúSir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.‚Äù I‚Äôll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy‚Äôs awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don‚Äôt need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‚Äòfund raiser mode‚Äô, but the time I actually need one?

BTW- the inside of a lighting bolt is bright yellow.",2023-08-06 19:47:46+00:00

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Now we are using google to find fishing lakes. I hunt alot of moose but Alfred is to small for moosehunt so i want to show the boy FloridaFish. 

Edit 2: I made a big mistake. Many people said that Lake City has no airport and i thought it was jokes. I ofcource know airplanes can park in Lake city and i have two tickets at my table. When i read closer i see that the ticket is for Salt lake city and not Lake city. I do not understand what happend and i am panicing.

791,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, love",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

But I have this fear, it always seems like everybody is talking about leaving Florida, but they never seem to actually do it.  Furthermore, people who do, it often seems like they end up back in short time.  One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.  

So what I am asking here, is there any success stories from former Floridians who moved away and loved it? Or just anybody who can share some experiences?

797,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, love",Californian visiting Florida for the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù and it was‚Ä¶ great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I‚Äôm not moving to Florida. I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami‚Äôs airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general.

And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I‚Äôve ever been too, and I‚Äôve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I‚Äôve ever experienced; and I‚Äôve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I‚Äôm going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I‚Äôm heading to Tampa which I‚Äôm very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! üòã

Anywho, just wanted to holler and tell you how cool I thought this state was, not being in the touristy Orlando spots. I hope to come down here and go camping in panther country some day. I had no idea panther crossing were a real thing before today?! I‚Äôm just blown away with how much there is to do, and eat down here‚Äìit‚Äôs endless! What a cool f‚Äôn place.

My other options are Northern Virginia, DC, PA, NJ. 

I was looking through the sub and instead of asking about pros and cons, tell me why you‚Äôre leaving. I‚Äôd love to hear from those of you who moved from the Northeast and are leaving the state.

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating. I'd be giving up everything I love, even down to the food, weather, and geography.

817,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, love",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

When extreme weather events hit‚Äîfloods, hurricanes, wildfires‚Äîevacuations and rescues become critical, but sometimes, resources and helping hands are limited. We're exploring ideas to strengthen our communities and would love to hear from you.

**The Concept:** Imagine a community where, in times of disaster, those with the means (vehicles, boats, safe spaces) not only ensure their own evacuation but also assist others in need. This support wouldn‚Äôt just be voluntary; there would be incentives‚Äîthings like tax breaks, gift cards, or community points that could be redeemed for local benefits.

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **If you had resources to help during a disaster (like a truck, extra room, etc.), would incentives motivate you to help others evacuate?**
2. **What types of incentives do you think would encourage people in your community to step up in times of crisis?**
3. **What barriers would prevent you from helping others in a disaster situation?**
4. **What‚Äôs one thing you think your community could do better to be prepared for an emergency?**

Your feedback could help shape a new solution that empowers communities to be more resilient in the face of climate challenges. If you have personal stories, ideas, or thoughts on the incentives system, please drop a comment below!

839,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, hate",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

Nice to see some justice in our country again and helping me look at the better side of things.  I've been so focused on my disgust of DeSantis and the policy makers here, the school board in Sarasota where my children go to school and so on that I've stopped taking time to appreciate some of the special things about Florida that I love.  So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

freaking love it out there",2023-07-19 15:00:23+00:00

cost of living, forget about it, insurance, forget about it, weather? how many years have these wildfires been happening?

For christs sake, you people have NO INCOME TAX!!!! Only a handful of states in the US have this privilege, and florida is the only one with good beaches. No income tax, wonderful destinations, plenty of jobs, yall have alot to be grateful for.  Id KILL for no income tax, thats literally a gift from god. Most people have to fight tooth and nail to evade taxes, but your government just hands it to you on a silver platter.

Im not trying to paint this as a left or right thing, I identify as socially left and economically right, so I am  not taking a side here. but seriously yall need to appreciate what you have that us in other states (CA, NC,SC) dont have at all.

I understand some of yall dont like desantis and dont like his social policy, fair enough (although that new alimony law should have won some of you socially left people over, alimony is a patriarchal construct in the first place)

853,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

854,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings.

Basically, I am a graduating engineer in Southern Ontario (near Toronto) and I'm unable to find a job here due to the job market.

Reasons why I want to leave Canada:

1. Terrible housing market (the low end for houses is $1M)
2. High Income Taxes
3. Terrible weather - hate the winter
4. No job opportunities

I am looking for a place where I can move with my gf (who is studying to be a dentist) to start a family. More specifically, a family friendly neighborhood.

859,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, enjoy",What has happened to Florida?,"I grew up in FL and moved away when I was 20. While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous. 

What happened to Florida? Its literally become the playground for the far right. I dont even associate it with Publix, alligators, oranges, beaches, dolphins and Jimmy Buffett music anymore.",2023-07-03 14:00:21+00:00

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside! I hope the weather will be warm so we can enjoy pure Florida barbeque.

Many thanks again!!

Edit 1: Wow so many people with comments to read! I read everything for Alfred and also showing Alfred pictures that is on Google. Alfred is only a 8 month baby but he is also so happy.

895,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, happy",Happy Hurricane Season!,"Hurricane season starts June 1, and this one will be a doozy.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.) 

EVERY SPOT IN FLORIDA IS VULNERABLE. Every spot has been hit. It doesn't matter what nun has blessed a spot or Indian burial grounds, no place is safe.

So step 1: Buy some supplies NOW. At the very least, you'll have water, batteries, and flashlights that are helpful in other situations. And get a camp fan and a camp stove. They are WONDERFUL during a storm.",2024-06-01 02:20:03+00:00
896,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US ‚Äì all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07+00:00

898,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‚ÄòDial *FHP for emergency‚Äô.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‚Äòsoon‚Äô.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it‚Äôs not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can‚Äôt see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‚Äòescorting‚Äô a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‚Äòwide load‚Äô sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm‚Ä¶) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while‚Ä¶. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, ‚ÄúNow that you‚Äôve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?‚Äù  The response: ‚ÄúSir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.‚Äù I‚Äôll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy‚Äôs awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don‚Äôt need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‚Äòfund raiser mode‚Äô, but the time I actually need one?

BTW- the inside of a lighting bolt is bright yellow.",2023-08-06 19:47:46+00:00

910,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, love",Has anybody here actually left Florida? Where did you end up moving and did you like it?,"Not sure what other subreddit to post this one, so if you know a better subreddit, let me know.

Quick context, I am a 25 year lifelong resident of South Florida, most of my family and friends live in that area.  Long story short, I do want to relocate for a wide number of reasons, big one is the overcrowdedness, Cost of Living, and horrifically awful traffic. I sort of have long held a searing hatred for traffic.

But I have this fear, it always seems like everybody is talking about leaving Florida, but they never seem to actually do it.  Furthermore, people who do, it often seems like they end up back in short time.  One of my close pals moved to North Carolina, and within 5 months was telling me every night he wanted to leave, he was back in Florida in 11 months.  Another moved to Portland Oregon and said the weather caused her so serious of a mental decline she was back in 15 months.  

So what I am asking here, is there any success stories from former Floridians who moved away and loved it? Or just anybody who can share some experiences? I deeply fear falling into the ""grass is greener"" trap, but then finding out the grass is yellow everywhere.  But I do feel like in my heart of hearts deep down I should relocate before my mental sanity flies off the handle in extremely crowded and busy area I live.",2023-04-30 17:30:36+00:00

913,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, love",Californian visiting Florida for the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù and it was‚Ä¶ great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I‚Äôm not moving to Florida. I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I‚Äôm 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami‚Äôs airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! üëÄ wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I‚Äôve ever been too, and I‚Äôve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I‚Äôve ever experienced; and I‚Äôve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I‚Äôm going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I‚Äôm heading to Tampa which I‚Äôm very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! üòã

933,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, love",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

Does it rain all day every day with cloudy skies or what does it look like?

Please give me some advice! I would really like to go to Florida but maybe it's better to visit some other time of year?

937,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, love",Please Help Us Understand How Communities Respond to Disasters!,"Hi Reddit! üëã We're participating in a hackathon focused on improving community resilience during natural disasters, and we need your insights! When extreme weather events hit‚Äîfloods, hurricanes, wildfires‚Äîevacuations and rescues become critical, but sometimes, resources and helping hands are limited. We're exploring ideas to strengthen our communities and would love to hear from you.

**The Concept:** Imagine a community where, in times of disaster, those with the means (vehicles, boats, safe spaces) not only ensure their own evacuation but also assist others in need. This support wouldn‚Äôt just be voluntary; there would be incentives‚Äîthings like tax breaks, gift cards, or community points that could be redeemed for local benefits.

**Questions to Consider:**

1. **If you had resources to help during a disaster (like a truck, extra room, etc.), would incentives motivate you to help others evacuate?**
2. **What types of incentives do you think would encourage people in your community to step up in times of crisis?**
3. **What barriers would prevent you from helping others in a disaster situation?**
4. **What‚Äôs one thing you think your community could do better to be prepared for an emergency?**

Your feedback could help shape a new solution that empowers communities to be more resilient in the face of climate challenges. If you have personal stories, ideas, or thoughts on the incentives system, please drop a comment below!

Basically, I am a graduating engineer in Southern Ontario (near Toronto) and I'm unable to find a job here due to the job market.

Reasons why I want to leave Canada:

1. Terrible housing market (the low end for houses is $1M)
2. High Income Taxes
3. Terrible weather - hate the winter
4. No job opportunities

I am looking for a place where I can move with my gf (who is studying to be a dentist) to start a family. More specifically, a family friendly neighborhood.

I'd only be able to move there by getting a TN visa from a work sponsorship.

955,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, hate",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

So I'll start: 

**Boating is the wild west here.**  You don't need a license or training or anything to buy a boat, register it and just start getting out there.  You don't need to register your engine.  You can DMV hop until you find one that will give you the title you are after if you buy a salvaged boat or one with no title.

I get some folks would find this to be lunacy, but its one of the things I truly love about living here and that feels like legit ""freedom.""  I still feel FL is a nanny state for most things, but not boating, and this isn't the thread for me to list the things I hate.

The tourists that come and rent boats are terrifying, but again, just part of the craziness of it all and I appreciate it. Any dingaling can rent a boat and just go, 40mph in a 20 foot bay boat, fuckin' cruisin.

I've seen a dude on one of those 90s jet skis that you have to pull yourself up on just looping in circles by the boat ramp, jet ski smoking, feet flapping behind as he struggles to understand how to use it and no one gives a shit, just part of the scene lol.

I've seen dudes in 10 foot jon boats with tiny engines cruising across the buy in 4 foot chop while its raining to go hit a fishing spot.

I've watched 15 college kids partying in a $200k boat, obviously belonging to one of their dads, cruise right into a 6"" deep area over a sandbar and get lodged for hours until the tide came back in.

969,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, hate",11 warnings about FLORIDA!,"I am a native Floridian. As a native Floridian stuck here due to family commitments I feel the need to educate everyone thinking about moving to this state and counsel them to think twice.

  
1. It's hot. Yes I know it gets hot in Fresno, in Houston, in Vegas, in West Virginia, in fucking Rochester NY. But the heat in FL, especially in central and south FL, is on another level (we are closest state to equator) and IT GOES ON FOR MONTHS WITHOUT A BREAK. It's in the 90s in April, it's in the 90s in October............and IT NEVER ENDS during those months. At least in Houston or Rochester you get a cool front here and there, in April, in Sept. Maybe one day the high will be 86. NOT IN FLORIDA. It will be fucking 90+ degrees minimum of 6 months straight THROUGH SEPT and into Oct. Oh yeah and it's hot and humid even at 5 a.m. So much so that you are drenched in sweat at 5 a.m. after walking the dog for 15 minutes. 

2. It's humid. ""Ohhhh, but humidity is great for the skin and lungs,"" you say. Yeah but you know what's not so great for the skin and lungs? CHLORINE. Do you like mildew on your front door? All over your shower? On your driveway? You will be spending A LOT of time and money fighting mildew with chlorine inside and outside your house or apartment -- in the 95 degree heat!

3. I hate the beach, but I will tolerate a pristine beach in Maine or Oregon. The beach in FL is like the bathing in the center of the sun. The sea air is 10,000 degrees, the sand is 10,000 degrees, the water is 10,000 degrees. And during April to Oct (the rainy season) Florida beach water is FULL of sewage (google it) or red tide or dead fish (or all of the above).

4. The grocery stores suck. The people who think Publix is good have never been to a better supermarket, and that's sad. Publix and the rest of the supermarkets here get CRAP produce and CRAP meats. The majority of the great produce and meats in this country DO NOT MAKE IT TO FLORIDA. You will be paying big bucks for substandard food quality.

5. The restaurants suck. Don't even think about finding a great bagel, great pizza or even a great taco in FL. Don't believe me; just ask any ex-NY or ex-CA person regretting their move here. And waiters in FL, 99% of them are on fentanyl.......

6. You will sit in traffic. No, not like the traffic in LA. Not like the traffic in DC or Chicago or Dallas. FL traffic is a special kind of fucked up shit that is THE most frustrating driving you will ever experience. This is because there's ZERO public transit in FL, there's not enough space to build more roads (being surrounded by water), and there's a serious amount of overdevelopment. I prefer to drive on a freeway in Atlanta or LA with 8 lanes on each side, than get stuck on some 4 lane road in FL where you have massive gridlock and crazy drivers. Which leads me to....

7. The drivers suck. People here drive like assholes. Don't even fight me on this. Cutting you off, shooting at your car. Have you ever been to a Latin American country and seen people drive right through red lights and stop signs? That's FL. Also, if you get into an accident you will get sued. That's like the No. 1 source of revenue in this state!

8. If you have children you are doing them a disservice by putting them in FL schools. People in FL think that the U of FL and FSU are ""elite"" universities. Nuff said.

9. Bugs. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes. I don't care how many mosquitoes you have in Schaumburg IL or Katy TX. You will be eaten alive by mosquitoes in FL even inside your house, because the minute you open a door they invade. You will take a daily shower in DEET, and hate it. Should I mention the flying roaches, gnats and all the other pests? Nah.

10. The cost of living in FL is outrageous. Forget rents and real estate, you've heard all about that. You will be paying $6,000 to insure your 2024 Honda Accord and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $10,000 to insure your 2,000 square foot home and you will be royal pissed. You will pay $3 for an avocado and $8 for a jar of Hellmanns at Publix and think to yourself, WHY DID I MOVE HERE. You will do all of this while getting paid some of the LOWEST WAGES in the USA. You will also pay $500 electric bills just to keep the AC in your 2000 sq foot house set at a sweaty 78 degrees. 

11. The weather. You say you love sweating in the heat? ""Give me the heat and humidity ANY DAY over cold or hot dry weather""! Well, do you also love power and internet outages? Do you also love losing power for 6 hours on a 95-degree day and sweating in your house praying the power company shows up? The nasty little secret about the weather in FL that nobody pays attention to is that we get FREQUENT power and internet outages. Even when there is no weather, MANY parts of FL have frequent outages due to the effects of heat and humidity on the (decrepit) grid infrastructure. It is NOT uncommon to have power/internet outages in FL 5-6 times a year, even on sunny days. If you work from home, FL is not the place you wanna live or run a business.  

You have been warned!

970,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, hate","Florida vs California, DC, Seattle","I've seen quite a bit of posts about people wishing to leave Florida and others saying how terrible other places are you live. I grew up in Florida (Hernando) and lived across central Florida (Orlando and Cocoa Beach) till I was about 30 years old. I have since lived in the SF area of California, worked around LA and San Diego, lived and worked in DC, and lived and worked in Seattle. 

Why I left:

Mostly wanted a change of weather and terrain. I used new jobs to move and explore different parts of the country. My wife hates mosquitoes and roaches so that's another valid reason I guess. I didn't leave for political reasons but my wife (not white) had been harassed by racists in bait shops around Titusville while we were there. I grew up not far from where the KKK burned crosses (around Hudson, FL) and have heard my fair share of remarks from ""good Christians"" saying how gays don't deserve to live if they live in sin (especially during the gay marriage ruling during Obama's terms). These weren't directly reasons for me to leave, but it's important to note that these things existed. Also important to note that there are plenty of drug addicts, homelessness, and generally crazy people throughout Florida since that's often used to describe the other places I've been. I've seen the same thing everywhere at varying scales.

How was it like to live elsewhere?

It's very interesting to live in other parts of the country. California is really just a few cities where people are located and a ton of farm land and small towns. The politics match the locations. The wealthier an area is, the more animosity there was for drug addicts and homelessness and a general lack of wanting to fix the issue and rather just look away or force people away. Generally California was just as friendly as Florida when interacting with people (San Diego was the closest match to a Florida beach feel though). I can't stress enough how crowded the big cities are. Take Orlando traffic and just multiply it by at least 10. It would take at least 1.5hrs to go 10 miles in rush hour traffic. California is expensive. Probably the most expensive place I've lived. And I felt it. Small apartment, budget for food and groceries, gas, etc. Taxes are high but my salary was higher so the other living expenses were the main reason I felt tight on money. There are pockets where you don't need a car, but I still think you should have one. There's a lot to do in the city areas but there was so much hiking around that I rather just have a car.

I consider DC to be very professional. If you go out to eat most people are dressed up. Florida I could go out in flip flops and casual clothes. DC I often wore button up shirts and slacks just to fit in. It's not always like that but much more people dressed professionally than anywhere I've been. Homelessness and crime were about as apparent as I've seen in Florida but less than what I saw in California. I think it's mostly a population density and weather thing. California weather was so nice all year that it really is easy to live outside. DC area is expensive but not bad. Rent in Florida cities are now about the same as the suburbs of DC. When I lived in Florida it was much cheaper, but that's how population increases and demand goes. People were generally nice, but not Florida hospitality nice. Plenty of racists around the area (in Maryland my wife was called a monkey) but closer to DC not so much. Plenty to do in DC though, lots of history, events, hikes, etc in a short distance away. You can easily go without a car here and just rent one when you want to go outside the city. Like California I'd rather have a car since I do a lot of exploring.

Seattle is by far the weirdest (mostly good way). Culture wise people are chill but not too friendly. Not many conversations or hangouts unless you really know them. You won't really be invited places unless you make the effort to make it happen. Homelessness not as bad as SF but definitely not good in many pockets. There are encampments squeezed into small places. When I visited family in Florida recently, I noticed smaller more spread out encampments which is probably why I didn't really notice it much when I lived there. It's really apparent in Seattle. Beer, wine, and cider culture are HUGE here. Music culture is also big. I've been to many more concerts here than anywhere I've been. Anything from raves to country to rap, kpop, rock, etc. It's not cold but not having much sun in the winter (November to June really) is tough. This will be the reason I leave and go explore another city. The summer though is PERFECT. I can't stress that enough. The scenery is also PERFECT. Not to mention their summer solstice parade... There are multiple volcanoes around and Mt. Rainier is enormous and beautiful. The hikes are the best I've been on (closest have been hikes in the Rockies). There's not a lot of diversity (mostly white and asian) like there was in the other places. It's expensive but my salary kept up and I don't feel the pain like I did going from Florida to California. There are more LGBTQ+ and generally more social activism in this city than anywhere I've been. 

What I miss from Florida:

Beaches. Springs. Manatees. Snorkeling. Friends and family. Relative cheap living (though last time I went my family said it's not great anymore). I bought my house for under $120k in Florida and it's on Zillow for over $350k... And this was in a pretty rural unincorporated subdivision. Seems closer to DC suburb prices now. Generally how much land and home size you get for the money is nice in Florida. Sunshine. I miss the sun and weather in the ""winter"" in Florida. 

Wrap up:

No matter the place there is crime and homelessness. No matter the place I've not had to deal with any of the crime personally. Mostly people are good people everywhere with pockets of hate. It's very difficult to go from Florida to any of these places just from the cost factor alone. You can do it, but you'll have very little cash at some point I would bet. It's easier to go to Florida still but prices are generally quite high now. 

I've seen hatred everywhere I've been, but the only hate directed to us has been from racists who happen to be Republicans. This is not a political post and realize that Republican doesn't equal racist or hate filled. That said, I've seen more hate messages in Florida than any other place I've been. Liberal activism can be nasty too, but my time in SF, DC, Seattle I've not seen the scale as I've seen it in Florida. So if you are moving to Florida and you aren't white, just know it'll happen at some point there. It's just how it is and there's no use denying it. Then again if you've got MAGA bumper stickers in Seattle, you probably will get hate thrown your way too. The hate is there but depends on if you're on the other side of it, but generally if you're not wearing your politics you won't notice much hate.

Costs and salaries. Had I stayed in Florida my salary would be just fine to live there, but I am over double what that would have been and live better in Seattle. Being part of the tech industry helps quite a bit and it's more of a economics thing (go where the demand is). If you are moving from a HCOL to Florida it'll be easier but you'll need to change your spending to match the lower salary. If you can work from anywhere with the same salary as your HCOL you'll be set. If you want to leave Florida and go to a HCOL the salary WILL be better but you won't feel it until you build savings. 

Hope that helped provide some insights to the sub!",2023-07-10 03:45:06+00:00

Personally,  I love Florida. Albeit it I'm from totally different state more northern.  The weather is perfect. The temperature is great,  people are nice,  nothing is ""forced"" politics,  or religion. I'm enjoying a lot of the perks here. Housing is decent,  untilies aren't outrageous.

Florida is essentially developed swampland, sure but Florida has a desirable climate, low taxes, and lots of corporations are moving here. Home prices here have gone up FASTER than the average ever since the invention of home air conditioning, florida has always had more inflow for most of y‚Äôall‚Äôs lives, for a reason.

I own a cabin in Anchorage AK, I bought it to fish, and avoid paying taxes on a work bonus. I‚Äôd kill myself if I had to live there. Believe it or not, but most people don‚Äôt like the cold. Most of the land area in the US gets pretty cold(below freezing lows for at least 1/3 of the year) and people are free to spend their money and move wherever they want.

Supply and demand forces are at play, many of us who are not homeowners may never own a home here, it sucks BIG, but that‚Äôs how it works. Same shit happened in Hawaii, bulldozed native homes to build ostentatious beachfront homes, LA, San Diego, Phoenix, Arizona, you think you‚Äôre special?. That‚Äôs just the name of game, jit.

Don‚Äôt have a gripe because people want to live in a nicer place, with nicer weather, with nicer tax treatment. That‚Äôs petty, makes you look childish.

If you‚Äôre dead set on hating someone because you‚Äôll never own a home here, hate Airbnb, OpenDoor, and Zillow, don‚Äôt hate people because they see an opportunity to live a better life, fuck that.

someone suggested i consider installing a mini-split for the garage instead of doing storage. my garage door is already insulated, although its not an impact door, if that matters.

Reasons why I want to leave Canada:

1. Terrible housing market (the low end for houses is $1M)
2. High Income Taxes
3. Terrible weather - hate the winter
4. No job opportunities

I am looking for a place where I can move with my gf (who is studying to be a dentist) to start a family. More specifically, a family friendly neighborhood.

975,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, enjoy",What has happened to Florida?,"I grew up in FL and moved away when I was 20. While I enjoyed growing up there, esp the beach, I got tired of it as a teenager, especially the lack of seasons or cooler weather in general but other things too. I lived in Miami and I was tired of being somewhere where most people around me didn't speak English, people were very rude and drove like maniacs. 

 I left, went out west, settled up north, do visit every now and then. As much as I was glad to be out of Florida I still proudly claimed to be from there, and not just Miami specifically, but Florida in general. 

But somethings changed in the era of Trump and DeSantis and Covid and Florida ain't been the same. My relatives have always been primarily Republican but they became fanatical with Trump. A lot of them think DeSantis is presidential material. They dont even have good arguments its just ""Well the Dems are socialist and thats that"". 

 I feel the Republican party has a particular meanstreak in Florida. Like theres a general meanness. They are like overgrown high school bullies picking on those who are different. Florida wasnt a bastion of progress by any means but as a gay person growing up there, it didn't feel THIS nasty. Now I lived in Texas in the Obama and early Trump years but Texas conservative didnt feel as toxic. I could get along with a lot of conservatives down there. 

I visited both Texas and Florida during Covid and even Texas was way better about wearing masks. Florida is weird. Like conservatives from there BRAG about their lack of restrictions. Not just those in smaller towns and cities but even in Miami. Its so bizzare to me to see people bragging about the state not caring about public health. Also disrespectful as I lost an uncle to Covid and a good friend of mine lost his dad to Covid too. And to see people bragging about not caring. So ugly. 

 I didn't leave Florida for political reasons but the politics there have made me glad I got out when Obama was in office and shit was .. normal. 

 See a lot of my conservative relatives claim Florida is the number one state in the nation. Meanwhile the progressives I know, like my brother is packing his bags to move to New England. He is going for law school but he's not planning to come back. He has had enough. My friend whose dad die from Covid and his boyfriend, they are fixing to move up to my area because the anti-LGBT laws are oppressive and they live in Broward county which is still ""blue"" but its gotten too ridiculous. 

What happened to Florida? Its literally become the playground for the far right. I dont even associate it with Publix, alligators, oranges, beaches, dolphins and Jimmy Buffett music anymore.",2023-07-03 14:00:21+00:00

I just booked airplanetickets for me and my son Alfred this very morning! We will land in Lake City in October and stay for 2.5 weeks! We will rent a car and mostly spend time in nature areas since Florida was to little expensive then i thought but that is no problem. Alfred also loves Animals and being outside!

978,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, enjoy",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

980,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, enjoy",Californian visiting Florida for the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù and it was‚Ä¶ great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I‚Äôm not moving to Florida. I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol.

I am considering the south of Georgia or north of Florida like Jacksonville, Gainesville, Ocala and may be Orlando too. We are not big fan of beach so definitely not considering any coastal areas.

We are in early 40s and considering buying a land (may be 2-4 ac lot) and get it constructed and use most of the portion in gardening and growing our own food.

Generally 2ac or more lots are available in outskirts of these cities. we like more of the rural communities and we might be Ok with this. Do we need to worry about security concerns in outskirts?

So I'm looking at moving to Central Florida from the west coast and am having some reservations with the idea so I'm hoping some people have advice.  


I love my mountains, forests, alpine lakes, and beaches. (I even like the moody weather here.) I'm fairly adventurous but I'm struggling with finding things in Florida I think I can enjoy. So far the list is kayaking and SCUBA diving. I'm excited to explore the national parks and springs too. And there are a couple of bouldering gyms within an hour or so of where I'd be living so I can join one of those too.  


I really hate theme parks and sitting on the beach. I don't like to be sedentary or indoors. I also can't get into hunting or fishing because I don't want to harm any animals.   


So my question is, are there any adventurous people in Florida and what do they do? I know I'm going to miss the fitness/outdoor/adventure culture on the west coast so I'm hoping I can find something I enjoy because right now the thought of moving is devastating. I'd be giving up everything I love, even down to the food, weather, and geography.

 I'd like to hear your take on places that don't deserve the raves-and the places that people aren't raving about yet.

My favorites in the **""good stuff"":**

**Clermont-Goombas**. Picture the pizza that a true old school NY Italian guy who has been making pizza for years would make. Incredible sauce. Good house salad dressing.  Nothing fancy, but a solid choice to grab a pizza before a movie.

**St. Augustine. The Flagler mansion** tour sells out at times, but it's an incredible structure. The dorms are rumored to be haunted, but that just adds to the flavor for me.

**Winter Park: Morse Museum** on Park Avenue. Tiffany made a stained glass chapel and they've got it, plus a lot more incredible pieces. A cool respite from all the hot weather and shops.

  
**""Meh"" over hyped**:

**St. Augustine: Aunt Kates**- terrible service, lackluster food. We were mystified by the amount of hype for this place. 

**Lake Wales: The Sizzling Grill**- If Meemaw lives nearby or you are on your way to LegoLand, don't trust the number of cars parked there for the taste of the food. Unless you enjoy the taste of canned veggies and copious amounts of oil, ruuuun like Forrest. 

**Miami- The Intercontinental Hotel**. Sure, you can pay a lot to wake up looking at the ships and sailboats. But the room was rather tired looking. Good luck trying to sleep before 1AM if they still have the party yacht blasting music every night right next to the hotel.

Buy some supplies, please? 

A big list of hurricane supplies are tax free from June 1-14 (including online purchases). At least buy some batteries, some flashlights, and some water. Don't be one of those who post on here while we're under a hurricane warning, wondering why you can't buy anything. [Here's a list.](https://www.wfla.com/weather/tracking-the-tropics/florida-disaster-preparedness-sales-tax-holiday-begins-june-1/)

FAQs:

""I don't live near the beach. Do I really need to prepare?""

For hurricane purposes, if you live in Florida, you live near the beach. Florida is flat and wet, so storms keep their power far inland. One of the counties that got smacked the hardest in 2004 was Polk County. 

""Well, I know people up north. I'll just drive up to TN/NC/GA.""

Good luck with that. This is a peninsula, and several million other people are going to do the same thing. Every northbound highway will have traffic jams the length of the state. And any gas station near a highway is going to be out of gas.

""Oh, I'll just prepare right before the storm.""

Think the worst Black Friday shopping ever, and triple it. Grocery stores, Costco, Walmart -- you name it, it's getting emptied.

""Do I really need to evacuate?""

Google your county and hurricane evacuation zones. Take them seriously. There were a bunch of old people in Ft Myers who called 911 during the worst of Ian because they didn't evacuate before Ian hit and water was coming into their houses. Emergency crews will NOT respond during a storm.

""Well, my realtor/neighbor/coworker has said that a storm has never hit here, so I don't care what the forecast says, I'm not leaving.

Again, good luck with that. (I especially like when the person who says an area is ""safe"" has only lived in Florida for a couple years.)

1012,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, happy",What on Earth is happening in South Florida ??,"Quick backstory: I am a 23-year-old fresh graduate with an IT degree from USF. I used to think I was extremely fortunate to live in Tampa. Growing up, the architectural and general beauty of the city far exceeded that of other states, and there was always tons to do with the Clearwater area being nearby, Siesta Key, the malls, the downtown area, etc. On top of the beauty, I also felt lucky to be here because of the beautiful weather, affordable housing, reasonable property tax, no income tax, low gas tax, and beautiful properties typically in nice gated communities. Also, Suarez in Miami was pushing for Miami to become the new Crypto capital of the world, and both Tampa and Miami were pushing to be major tech hubs in the US ‚Äì all good for me and my field.  
Unfortunately, all the happiness, excitement, and feeling of being lucky to be in South Florida have all vanished. It seems like Covid has absolutely destroyed this state, particularly for the younger folk, and I am now eyeing to leave the state altogether. Basically, from my experience, COVID did a good job of highlighting state governments that are good at managing their state and those who are completely incompetent. Florida was one of the states that handled COVID very well. Some states started to unfairly shell out tons of aid money to help those struggling, but the rich took advantage of this by raising prices and buying desperate people out of their homes and jacking up rental costs. Also, all the states that mismanaged funds started to raise taxes to accommodate such as California, New York, and Illinois, who priced their residents and are all experiencing record negative population decreases. Also, the work from home movement allowed people to realize that they can easily take their talents elsewhere, and states such as Florida, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have seen a massive influx of new residents who escaped their crappy home states in search of more affordable opportunities. This has caused a giant mess for us who are local to the state as the economic standards in Florida have drastically changed.  
First, the influx of people from high-income states such as NY and CA have totally obliterated the housing market in South Florida, especially Tampa. You look on Zillow, and there are barely any homes for sale or rent, and if there are, they are going for astronomical prices. I would have to pay a huge chunk of my take-home pay to afford rent in a basic condo or house. Also, the influx of talent that has come to the state has saturated the market for any new entry-level individuals graduating from local Florida schools. Every time I apply for a job, I am basically competing with 1000 other people from all over the country to be interviewed by a manager who recently moved to Florida from California. The traffic is unbelievable now, with typical drives that used to take 15 minutes now taking nearly an hour. Taxes have gone up significantly, and due to all the insurance claims and new people moving in, premiums have skyrocketed all across the board. What used to be a paradise is now a nightmare to be in, where the older generation adds to the soul-crushing experience by saying how easy they had it 10-20 years ago. I find myself looking for opportunities in the Atlanta area, but I am curious if I am off base with my thinking or if others are going through the same thing.",2023-07-30 18:05:07+00:00

1014,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, happy",How long should FHP take to respond to an incident?,"I am sure you have seen the blue signs and call boxes on the Interstates.  ‚ÄòDial *FHP for emergency‚Äô.    Thankfully, I have never needed to call before Saturday Evening.  

Let me set the stage for you:

I was traveling westbound on I-10 into Pensacola, a storm broke out , with severe lightning.  As soon as I entered the bridge, my car was struck by LIGHTNING.  (Again, thankfully neither wifey or I were hurt).  The Car was catastrophically disabled.  I drive (erghh, drove) a hybrid and my guess is that all the electrical systems were seized and the transmission probably locked.  Power steering and ABS disabled. 

We were able to coast/skid to a stop, MOSTLY in the emergency lane. Only mostly,  in the lane.  My wife and I took a beat, and then she called 911.  This call was made at 4:22pm. 
911 transferred her to FHP and gave her location/ need to dispatch.  They told us some one be coming out ‚Äòsoon‚Äô.  

At 4:31 once I calmed down better, I called my insurance company for some roadside assistance and a tow truck.  

Now I understand that this was Inclement weather so anyone will probably take longer to get out than if the weather was good.  I also understand that the weather was probably stretching emergency services resources thinner.  

However, the car is still partially in an active lane, and has NO ELECTRICAL ANTYTHING.  Meaning I have no emergency flashers or break lights.  

The car is extremely unsafe to be in, but it‚Äôs not particularly safer to get out of it either.  After the 30th time the car gets swayed back and forth by traffic that can‚Äôt see us, I call FHP again. 

@ 4:54 I Dial *FHP and explain my situation, am told by dispatch that someone will come out, and I see blue lights in the distance behind me.  (First time I am happy about this!!!) I wait a minute thinking this crazy experience can start to get resolved, and the blue lights drive on by!  (This one appears to be ‚Äòescorting‚Äô a commercial load somewhere). 

3 minutes later a 2nd FHP escorting a ‚Äòwide load‚Äô sort of vehicle drives by with its blue lights on. 

@5:07pm (still in the storm‚Ä¶) I see a FHP cruiser drive by, Blue lights off!! drive on by.  
I call FHP for the 3rd time and am told that they are extremely busy and it will be a while‚Ä¶. WTF!!!

About 5 minutes later, a random car comes so close to hitting us, he nearly skids and causes another accident. I call FHP for the 4th time. 

5:13pm I call and say that my wife and I are in a very precarious situation and we need advice. I ask, ‚ÄúNow that you‚Äôve heard my situation, and the dangerous position the car is in, is it safer to stay in the car, or to get out and walk across this bridge ?‚Äù  The response: ‚ÄúSir it is illegal to walk across an interstate bridge.‚Äù I‚Äôll admit that I lost my composure at this point.  They assured me someone would be out.  

5:35pm Randy from Hook-em Up Towing arrived.  Randy‚Äôs awesome! He got the car moved then hooked up and us into his truck by 545 and we were gone. We did not see FHP before we left. 

TLDR So, is 90+ minutes response time FROM Emergency services what we should be expecting?  I certainly don‚Äôt need to wait to find a FHP cruiser if they are in ‚Äòfund raiser mode‚Äô, but the time I actually need one?

1022,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, love",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

1024,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, love",Californian visiting Florida for the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù and it was‚Ä¶ great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I‚Äôm not moving to Florida. I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

However, I was born and raised in Florida, moved out of the state almost a decade ago now and every year I think about moving back but I am afraid of only being drawn back by nostalgia. I was raised in Pasco County, to give you an idea of where I'm from. I had no choice but to move, seeing as I was a minor at the time but now that I am financially stable and have nothing tying me down I've been toying with the idea to move back. I hate the winters, the snow is absolutely awful and just this last week it was -38 here in Montana. I have no love for snow sports, I love the heat and the humidity is something I'm used to. I would much rather do warm activities such as exploring, boating, hiking, and things of that nature. 

The main reason I want to move back to Florida is all my siblings live there with their kids, I am very family oriented and want to be involved in their lives. I know it's gotten far more expensive to live, but I am also moving from a place where a 1bd/1bath costs about 2,000$ a month. Car insurance here is cheap but car registration is not. Food prices are insane, but gas prices are low currently. Not to mention, the harsh conditions of the roads and the snow causes ware and tear on your vehicle. Within two months of living in Montana I had accumulated two cracks in my windshield and I stay far behind others while driving. All this to say, I am not very happy here.  Also Montana is very isolated with their cities, you have to drive at least two hours to get to another 'big' city. I like populated areas, being in the city. Yada yada. 

I've lived in Saint Louis, Detroit, and now a rinky-dink town in Montana so I am no stranger to extremely populated areas with high crime rates, low pay, and extremely populated areas.

Just wanted to write a quick post about how much I loved seeing Florida in a different way than I ever have. I‚Äôm 33 and grew-up and live near Salt Lake City. I have been to Orlando several times before now to visit theme parks, but this time I was here for work, and it was truly an awesome experience!

I flew into Orlando because I figured Miami‚Äôs airport would be nuts this time of year and I reallllly wanted to drive down the turnpike. So I rented a model 3 and cruised on down to Miami for two nights. I stayed at the Nobu mid-beach and it was a very cool hotel. I loved the vibe of Miami, and Miami Beach in general. I avoided south beach like the plague because I heard it was a shit show, but the rest of it was amazing! The Cuban food/coffee. The diversity. The weather this time of year! The ladies! üëÄ wowza! And the skyline is beautiful! I was shocked when I read Miami only has 400k people because it seems like one of the biggest cities I‚Äôve ever been too, and I‚Äôve been around!

From there I drove across the state on I41 up through Naples to FT Meyers. Absolutely incredible drive! Coming from the mountainy desert of the west, it was just sooooo different than any drive I‚Äôve ever experienced; and I‚Äôve drove from SLC to Charlotte, and SLC to Baltimore before. Never seen anything like that! 

Next I‚Äôm going to be spending the night here in FT Meyers, which after being in Miami for a couple days is quite the change of pace lol (people in Miami drive like crap holy f***) but FT Meyers is a cool place too, though! Has a real chill ocean town vibe. And people here are really nice. Next I‚Äôm heading to Tampa which I‚Äôm very excited about. Can anyone from FT Meyers tell me if that Oxbow by the water is a good place to get a nice meal? Hoping to grab some good seafood tonight! üòã

We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them.

I also think that the developed areas here are ugly AF and that there is no character or sense of place.

I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background?

1082,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, happy",Thinking about moving to Florida from Montana.,"Don't get me wrong, Montana is an absolutely gorgeous state with views that don't compare to many other places. However, I was born and raised in Florida, moved out of the state almost a decade ago now and every year I think about moving back but I am afraid of only being drawn back by nostalgia. I was raised in Pasco County, to give you an idea of where I'm from. I had no choice but to move, seeing as I was a minor at the time but now that I am financially stable and have nothing tying me down I've been toying with the idea to move back. I hate the winters, the snow is absolutely awful and just this last week it was -38 here in Montana. I have no love for snow sports, I love the heat and the humidity is something I'm used to. I would much rather do warm activities such as exploring, boating, hiking, and things of that nature. 

The main reason I want to move back to Florida is all my siblings live there with their kids, I am very family oriented and want to be involved in their lives. I know it's gotten far more expensive to live, but I am also moving from a place where a 1bd/1bath costs about 2,000$ a month. Car insurance here is cheap but car registration is not. Food prices are insane, but gas prices are low currently. Not to mention, the harsh conditions of the roads and the snow causes ware and tear on your vehicle. Within two months of living in Montana I had accumulated two cracks in my windshield and I stay far behind others while driving. All this to say, I am not very happy here.  Also Montana is very isolated with their cities, you have to drive at least two hours to get to another 'big' city. I like populated areas, being in the city. Yada yada. 

I've lived in Saint Louis, Detroit, and now a rinky-dink town in Montana so I am no stranger to extremely populated areas with high crime rates, low pay, and extremely populated areas. 

For those of you who were born in Florida, left and then came back, was it something you regretted or were you drawn back and enjoying it?  ",2024-01-18 19:44:01+00:00

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60‚Äôs?) single pane windows. I‚Äôm still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7¬∞ temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, ‚Äúewww. 80s? You lizard. ü¶é‚Äú ... Lol, the room is around 78¬∞ and is a completely uninsulated 1970‚Äôs porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I‚Äôm thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

I do not care about power outages it is irrelevant. It's back on in a few days or a few hours. Most people fear power outages in Florida due to the extreme temperatures and the inability to find air conditioning in such an occasion. So you are aware the Florida born and raised can wear black sweater and a hoodie outside as I do this everyday. I wore the black hoodie to keep the sunlight off me. Even when I worked outside doing manual labor I kept a sweater on me. At lunch time when you take it off everything feels frigid like you just walked into a 73¬∞ house. This all comes from personal experience. If you're not seasoned for heat then you probably shouldn't be in Florida. It takes time for your body to be acclimated to the harsh climate here. What most people would consider suffering humidity we as Floridians don't really even notice it most of the time. Because when you're born in it, that just makes it business as usual. I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone. Democracy dies in the state. Heat makes people only care about what's actually important. So if you're from up North welcome to the Republic.

We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01+00:00

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60‚Äôs?) single pane windows. I‚Äôm still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7¬∞ temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, ‚Äúewww. 80s? You lizard. ü¶é‚Äú ... Lol, the room is around 78¬∞ and is a completely uninsulated 1970‚Äôs porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I‚Äôm thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

Most people fear power outages in Florida due to the extreme temperatures and the inability to find air conditioning in such an occasion. So you are aware the Florida born and raised can wear black sweater and a hoodie outside as I do this everyday. I wore the black hoodie to keep the sunlight off me. Even when I worked outside doing manual labor I kept a sweater on me. At lunch time when you take it off everything feels frigid like you just walked into a 73¬∞ house. This all comes from personal experience. If you're not seasoned for heat then you probably shouldn't be in Florida. It takes time for your body to be acclimated to the harsh climate here. What most people would consider suffering humidity we as Floridians don't really even notice it most of the time. Because when you're born in it, that just makes it business as usual. I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone. Democracy dies in the state. Heat makes people only care about what's actually important. So if you're from up North welcome to the Republic.

1117,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snowfall, love",Born and raised in SWFL‚Ä¶I have always hated it here. Why do my fellow Floridians like Florida? Am I missing something? ,"Born in Naples and raised in Punta Gorda. I‚Äôve never lived anywhere else but PG. Growing up everyone around me was so elderly and cut of the same cloth: 401k retirees with money to spend (with the exception of my own family). I found it terribly boring to grow up here. I was pretty antisocial in my youth to be fair, so part of that could‚Äôve been on me. The best way I can describe my feelings on SWFL is this: there is a distinct lack of history and culture that has resulted in a region of vain, surface-level city identities. I always felt like I was disconnected from the rest of the country and I was being raised in a fake, cookie-cutter corporate town setting where there was nothing ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

I also know that people both native and transplant love Florida for the weather, but I disagree here too. I have always HATED the climate here. I‚Äôve still never been in active snowfall and haven‚Äôt touched snow since I was 3 years old. Ironically, I actually love cold weather and dislike the heat. Funny since my father moved down here to get away from the cold in Maine, where my heritage is based.

I love the outdoors but I have to say I‚Äôm not interested in the nature of Florida either. I have never been taken away by natural beauty in Florida, not even in the Everglades. I do love the beach, but if you put me in mountains or a river valley or an evergreen forest, I‚Äôll be very happy. 

Of course it‚Äôs not all bad, I do like Tampa and Orlando to an extent, in fact I‚Äôm going to UCF in August and I‚Äôm thrilled for that. Miami isn‚Äôt my type though. 

As a young adult now I‚Äôve started to travel on my own and I find myself enjoying my time in the majority of places I see outside of the Deep South. I‚Äôve been along the entire eastern seaboard as well as Texas and Washington state, with a few days in Alaska too. Most places I‚Äôve seen, I at least like as much as SWFL. And every time I drive back to my Highway exit off of I-75, my heart sinks into my stomach and I say, ‚ÄúOh no, Im here again.‚Äù 

The point of this post isn‚Äôt to air my grievances and complain. I know that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done, but really I want to open a discussion. I know how I feel about my home state, and I‚Äôm curious if there are many other FL natives that feel the same way, or if you disagree‚Ä¶why? 

Additionally, do you think there is a factor at play of someone‚Äôs preference for a certain area and their family background? I ask this because as I mentioned, my heritage is in Maine and before that Quebec. I am the only member of my family that is from the sunshine state, all of the rest live in the Northeast with the exception of Tennessee and California. This is probably just in my head, but when I‚Äôm up here in the Northeast (as I am right now) it feels like‚Ä¶well, like home. I‚Äôve never felt that way about FL.

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01+00:00

Yet, I'm still schvitzing like an Airedale if I'm outside for more than 10 minutes. 

This is a problem as I come back from walking the dog (doesn't matter what time of day) soaking wet. 

I used to love gardening, hiking, & just generally being outside, but now all I want to do is hide in the A/C from May through January. 

If anyone has any advice/tips/strategies for actually getting used to this climate, I'd really appreciate it. 

Having said that, please don't reply with ""Oh, you'll get used to it"" or ""Gee, it doesn't bother me"" because after three years, I haven't & it does. (I mean that sincerely, I'm not trying to be snarky.)

1135,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snowfall, enjoy",Californian visiting Florida for the ‚Äúfirst time‚Äù and it was‚Ä¶ great!,"Before anyone gets their pitchforks out I‚Äôm not moving to Florida. I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February? 

Also tell me your secret dealing with the homeless. I saw maybe one or two in the entire 4 days I spent in Miami. What did you do with them? We have a lot to learn from you in California in this regard. Also the garbage. It seems like we have an epidemic with garbage in a lot of places of California, even natural places and I noticed your South Florida cities and highways are very clean. You‚Äôre definitely doing something right. But you have some terrible drivers though. I was warned that Miami had some really bad driving and it didn‚Äôt disappoint, lol. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad I visited. I love my state but I had a great time in yours and hope to vacation again there soon. Just like the negative California headlines you probably hear and read about there‚Äôs way too many negative Florida headlines I hear and read about at home and on this forum so I‚Äôm glad I was able to discover the reality is much different.",2024-02-11 01:06:05+00:00

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60‚Äôs?) single pane windows. I‚Äôm still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7¬∞ temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, ‚Äúewww. 80s? You lizard. ü¶é‚Äú ... Lol, the room is around 78¬∞ and is a completely uninsulated 1970‚Äôs porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I‚Äôm thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

Most people fear power outages in Florida due to the extreme temperatures and the inability to find air conditioning in such an occasion. So you are aware the Florida born and raised can wear black sweater and a hoodie outside as I do this everyday. I wore the black hoodie to keep the sunlight off me. Even when I worked outside doing manual labor I kept a sweater on me. At lunch time when you take it off everything feels frigid like you just walked into a 73¬∞ house. This all comes from personal experience. If you're not seasoned for heat then you probably shouldn't be in Florida. It takes time for your body to be acclimated to the harsh climate here. What most people would consider suffering humidity we as Floridians don't really even notice it most of the time. Because when you're born in it, that just makes it business as usual. I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone.

We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them.

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60‚Äôs?) single pane windows. I‚Äôm still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7¬∞ temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, ‚Äúewww. 80s? You lizard. ü¶é‚Äú ... Lol, the room is around 78¬∞ and is a completely uninsulated 1970‚Äôs porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I‚Äôm thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

I do not care about power outages it is irrelevant. It's back on in a few days or a few hours. Most people fear power outages in Florida due to the extreme temperatures and the inability to find air conditioning in such an occasion. So you are aware the Florida born and raised can wear black sweater and a hoodie outside as I do this everyday. I wore the black hoodie to keep the sunlight off me. Even when I worked outside doing manual labor I kept a sweater on me. At lunch time when you take it off everything feels frigid like you just walked into a 73¬∞ house. This all comes from personal experience. If you're not seasoned for heat then you probably shouldn't be in Florida. It takes time for your body to be acclimated to the harsh climate here. What most people would consider suffering humidity we as Floridians don't really even notice it most of the time. Because when you're born in it, that just makes it business as usual. I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone. Democracy dies in the state. Heat makes people only care about what's actually important. So if you're from up North welcome to the Republic.

I‚Äôm not one to contribute to everyone‚Äôs nightmare: Californians moving in and ruining their state. That said, I had a great time visiting.

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible. 

Finally there‚Äôs Miami. I really enjoyed it but it almost feels like you‚Äôre living in another country. Spanish being a primary language is actually even more pronounced than Los Angeles and English is really an afterthought. Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February?

1197,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, blizzard, comfortable",Heat film - effective heat reduction on old windows,"For those of us where replacing windows simply isn‚Äôt an option financially, or logistically, or because you‚Äôre a renter, just wanted to share a small success story on heat film.

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60‚Äôs?) single pane windows. I‚Äôm still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7¬∞ temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, ‚Äúewww. 80s? You lizard. ü¶é‚Äú ... Lol, the room is around 78¬∞ and is a completely uninsulated 1970‚Äôs porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I‚Äôm thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

Most people fear power outages in Florida due to the extreme temperatures and the inability to find air conditioning in such an occasion. So you are aware the Florida born and raised can wear black sweater and a hoodie outside as I do this everyday. I wore the black hoodie to keep the sunlight off me. Even when I worked outside doing manual labor I kept a sweater on me. At lunch time when you take it off everything feels frigid like you just walked into a 73¬∞ house. This all comes from personal experience. If you're not seasoned for heat then you probably shouldn't be in Florida. It takes time for your body to be acclimated to the harsh climate here. What most people would consider suffering humidity we as Floridians don't really even notice it most of the time. Because when you're born in it, that just makes it business as usual. I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone. Democracy dies in the state. Heat makes people only care about what's actually important. So if you're from up North welcome to the Republic.

We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01+00:00

This is the result of Gila Heat Control Film on our old (60‚Äôs?) single pane windows. I‚Äôm still working through the many glass sections, but noticed that you could actually see a brightness difference on the coffee table. 

I grabbed the thermometer and saw almost 7¬∞ temperature difference for the surface of the coffee table between the sections with tint film vs without.

For those of you thinking, ‚Äúewww. 80s? You lizard. ü¶é‚Äú ... Lol, the room is around 78¬∞ and is a completely uninsulated 1970‚Äôs porch add-on. It can get more comfortable but the heat through the windows is INTENSE. Surfaces absorb heat, so yes, the coffee table is HOT from being in direct sunlight.

I‚Äôm thrilled with what the heat film might mean for the comfort and use of that room. And, thought people here might appreciate this comparatively low-cost way to lower the amount of heat transfer coming in through old single pane glass windows. 

The film application is finicky and there's definitely a learning curve, but slowly I'm working through it.  
It is NOT static cling. I'm using the application kit.

I do not care about power outages it is irrelevant. It's back on in a few days or a few hours. Most people fear power outages in Florida due to the extreme temperatures and the inability to find air conditioning in such an occasion. So you are aware the Florida born and raised can wear black sweater and a hoodie outside as I do this everyday. I wore the black hoodie to keep the sunlight off me. Even when I worked outside doing manual labor I kept a sweater on me. At lunch time when you take it off everything feels frigid like you just walked into a 73¬∞ house. This all comes from personal experience. If you're not seasoned for heat then you probably shouldn't be in Florida. It takes time for your body to be acclimated to the harsh climate here. What most people would consider suffering humidity we as Floridians don't really even notice it most of the time. Because when you're born in it, that just makes it business as usual. I have a favorite line ""you need to be comfortable in chaos"". Because Florida is chill and chaotic at the same time. We carry all walks of life here. Because in this state you find freedom. Which is why you also find a lot of guns here. Everybody here gets along because they know the gun carriers in this state are for protecting freedoms. Everybody stands behind the Republican party in Florida. You get the few off comments here and there. But that's just from people who moved to Florida and are still adjusting to the lifestyle. It doesn't really matter how much the older generation fights once their kids are introduced to the children of Florida they will adapt and the northern ways of the people who just moved will disappear with the generations just like it does everybody else. There is no exception Florida is a social meat grinder were ideologies come to die. And why is that because in Florida's heat people don't have patience for BS it's either fact or it ain't. Nobody cares to waste energy on nonsense. Which is why the northerners that move down here are still pretty angry. But in time that will disappear as Florida's heat sucks that will straight out of them. In the end the only thing they will care about is maintaining their freedoms and being left alone. Democracy dies in the state. Heat makes people only care about what's actually important. So if you're from up North welcome to the Republic.

We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01+00:00

I landed in Miami and drove to Key West and spent a couple of days there. Then drove to Naples to see my wife‚Äôs family and spent a couple of days there and then another couple of days in Miami. 

A couple of observations compared to my home state. Your roads are mostly in great shape: didn‚Äôt really run into pothole after pothole or old cracking roads. When it rains it really rains as happened on my way from Miami to Key West. It was just pouring buckets and people on freeways just put their hazards on and others pull over to the shoulder. What‚Äôs that all about?

Key West was great with a very vacation island vibe and great weather in February. I had booked a ferry to Dry Tortugas but ended up canceling due to bad weather out at sea. Also, I could not find many hotels with their own beach so I guess a nice expansive sandy beach is not really a thing in Key West. All I could really enjoy was the beach on the south side of the island which was fine but the water is a tad cold for this time of the year. Lastly, I saw the rent and real estate prices there and started to wonder how any of the people in the service industry can afford to live here. These are probably higher than California/NY rent and real estate prices. 

The drive to Naples was great and I took the 41 and saw tons of alligators which was awesome. Naples was interesting with almost no young people in sight and more exotic car dealerships than Beverly Hills. I didn‚Äôt realize there was this much wealth in this area. But again, talking to my family and discussing salaries in the area, who can actually afford to live here? I was warned by my family that the weather I experienced this last week with low humidity and cool temperatures is an anomaly. Even by their own experience, Naples weather in the summer is downright horrible.

Also, for as much wealth and ostentatious displays of wealth I always read about Miami I didn‚Äôt see much in DT Miami or Miami Beach. Are all the rich people on vacation in February?

1246,Florida,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, frosty, love",Impact Windows and Low-E gains,"Hi all,

  
We're getting ready to lock down a contract for impact doors and windows, but I am unsure if I should get low-e coating on all of my glass or just some of them.  

For context, the home is in south Florida, the back of the home faces east with a lot of big windows and a sliding door on the first floor (most of the windows are on the east and south side), a glass front door with two little side windows framing it, and a sliding glass door on the second floor balcony (facing south). We keep the house cold year round (69-72) and would love to maximize energy efficiency. 

The company we are working with advised that a low-e coating on the glass is only really effective for glass that gets direct sunlight, and suggested to skip on the coating for any glass that doesn't face east or west. Aside from the color discrepancies of not coating all the glass, their logic...doesn't sit well with me. 

I get that the coating would reflect direct sunlight back, thus lowering the overall temperature of the home. But given the extreme heat and sunlight we have down here, I can't reconcile the idea that all the windows facing north and south don't get enough ""direct"" sunlight to warrant coating them. 

Any thoughts, opinions, or real world examples would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",2024-10-02 23:28:01+00:00

Preferred location would be in town somewhere since we‚Äôd have several out-of-state visitors who would probably be staying in Waikiki. But open to other suggestions as well.

- indoors (or during cooler weather if outdoors)
- ceremony and reception in the same area
- dancefloor/DJ/MC
- buffet food
- 5pm - 11 pm(?)
- wedding planner
- photographer
- videographer

Does anyone know any ski resorts that can be reached with one direct flight from HNL (preferably flying Hawaiian) and then minimal driving when we land - ideally less than an hour?

Perhaps a better phrasing of this question is what is the closest ski resort to Hawaii? Doesn‚Äôt need to be mainland - could be international, although I‚Äôm sure west coast will be closest.

But then I did the math, and I figure that the fuel price doesn't come close to explaining it.

In short, I think that oil should cost about 13 cents per kWh, implying  a 31 cent markup by HECO.  Even if HECO got its oil for free, it would still be the most expensive power in the US.

On the mainland, generating costs are about 6 cents a kWh (natural gas), which gets marked up by 9 cents to about 15 cents per kWh.    

So why is power here so expensive?

High labor costs?  Only a bit.  HI has an [average median wage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_median_wage_and_mean_wage).

Difficult terrain?  Oahu is hilly, but the built-up parts tend to be flat, and compact.   There are no large uninhabited stretches that need long power lines to serve a handful of people.

Weather and hurricanes?  I don't see too many buried lines, or hurricane proofing.   There are also no blizzards or snowstorms.

Even if HI goes all-renewables, and solar and wind end up being basically free, the cost of power won't drop much.

the boring math: crude oil costs $72/bbl or $1.71/gallon, and one gallon has [146 million Joules of thermal energy](https://www.convertunits.com/from/JOULE/to/gallon+[U.S.]+of+diesel+oil), which at [minimal 33% thermodynamic efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam-electric_power_station#Efficiency) generates about 48 million Joules of electricity, which is 13.3 kWh - ie 48e6 (J/gal)/(3600x1000 J/kWh)=13.33 kW/gal.  So the cost of the oil to produce 1 kWh is $1.71/13.33=$0.13. In fact, the thermodynamic efficiency of a steam plant is likely higher than 33%, so the cost of oil to make a kWh is less.

Maybe Hawaii burns VLSFO (very low sulfur oil) and not crude, which is $666 per metric ton, or ($666/MT)/(7.46 bbl/MT)=$90/bbl, so my estimate could be a bit low, but not too much.  Then the efficiency is better than 33%, which makes up for this error.


Even though oil is expensive, most of the 44 cent per kWh retail cost of power has nothing to do with oil prices. Even if oil were free, HECO would still charge about 30 cents a kWh, more than any other state",2023-05-15 22:43:57+00:00

We‚Äôd love something nice for sure and if need be we can try to trim the guest list. We don‚Äôt need a grand Waikiki hotel wedding (though if there is one that fits our budget that would be great). Preferred location would be in town somewhere since we‚Äôd have several out-of-state visitors who would probably be staying in Waikiki. But open to other suggestions as well.

Preferences:
- indoors (or during cooler weather if outdoors)
- ceremony and reception in the same area
- dancefloor/DJ/MC
- buffet food
- 5pm - 11 pm(?)
- wedding planner
- photographer
- videographer

Generally speaking, is this budget pretty far-fetched or is it doable?

The budget is after putting down payment for our home. My fiance and I both agreed to prioritize housing over wedding. We‚Äôre looking at aiming for 2025.",2023-09-10 21:21:03+00:00

But then I did the math, and I figure that the fuel price doesn't come close to explaining it.

In short, I think that oil should cost about 13 cents per kWh, implying  a 31 cent markup by HECO.  Even if HECO got its oil for free, it would still be the most expensive power in the US.

On the mainland, generating costs are about 6 cents a kWh (natural gas), which gets marked up by 9 cents to about 15 cents per kWh.    

So why is power here so expensive?

High labor costs?  Only a bit.  HI has an [average median wage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_median_wage_and_mean_wage).

Difficult terrain?  Oahu is hilly, but the built-up parts tend to be flat, and compact.   There are no large uninhabited stretches that need long power lines to serve a handful of people.

Weather and hurricanes?  I don't see too many buried lines, or hurricane proofing.   There are also no blizzards or snowstorms.

Even if HI goes all-renewables, and solar and wind end up being basically free, the cost of power won't drop much.

the boring math: crude oil costs $72/bbl or $1.71/gallon, and one gallon has [146 million Joules of thermal energy](https://www.convertunits.com/from/JOULE/to/gallon+[U.S.]+of+diesel+oil), which at [minimal 33% thermodynamic efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam-electric_power_station#Efficiency) generates about 48 million Joules of electricity, which is 13.3 kWh - ie 48e6 (J/gal)/(3600x1000 J/kWh)=13.33 kW/gal.  So the cost of the oil to produce 1 kWh is $1.71/13.33=$0.13. In fact, the thermodynamic efficiency of a steam plant is likely higher than 33%, so the cost of oil to make a kWh is less.

Maybe Hawaii burns VLSFO (very low sulfur oil) and not crude, which is $666 per metric ton, or ($666/MT)/(7.46 bbl/MT)=$90/bbl, so my estimate could be a bit low, but not too much.  Then the efficiency is better than 33%, which makes up for this error.


Even though oil is expensive, most of the 44 cent per kWh retail cost of power has nothing to do with oil prices. Even if oil were free, HECO would still charge about 30 cents a kWh, more than any other state",2023-05-15 22:43:57+00:00

We‚Äôd love something nice for sure and if need be we can try to trim the guest list. We don‚Äôt need a grand Waikiki hotel wedding (though if there is one that fits our budget that would be great). Preferred location would be in town somewhere since we‚Äôd have several out-of-state visitors who would probably be staying in Waikiki. But open to other suggestions as well.

Preferences:
- indoors (or during cooler weather if outdoors)
- ceremony and reception in the same area
- dancefloor/DJ/MC
- buffet food
- 5pm - 11 pm(?)
- wedding planner
- photographer
- videographer

the boring math: crude oil costs $72/bbl or $1.71/gallon, and one gallon has [146 million Joules of thermal energy](https://www.convertunits.com/from/JOULE/to/gallon+[U.S.]+of+diesel+oil), which at [minimal 33% thermodynamic efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam-electric_power_station#Efficiency) generates about 48 million Joules of electricity, which is 13.3 kWh - ie 48e6 (J/gal)/(3600x1000 J/kWh)=13.33 kW/gal.  So the cost of the oil to produce 1 kWh is $1.71/13.33=$0.13. In fact, the thermodynamic efficiency of a steam plant is likely higher than 33%, so the cost of oil to make a kWh is less.

Maybe Hawaii burns VLSFO (very low sulfur oil) and not crude, which is $666 per metric ton, or ($666/MT)/(7.46 bbl/MT)=$90/bbl, so my estimate could be a bit low, but not too much.  Then the efficiency is better than 33%, which makes up for this error.


Even though oil is expensive, most of the 44 cent per kWh retail cost of power has nothing to do with oil prices. Even if oil were free, HECO would still charge about 30 cents a kWh, more than any other state",2023-05-15 22:43:57+00:00

1394,Hawaii,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, comfortable","Expensive electricity - I'm pretty sure it's not the cost of oil, but huge HECO overheads markups. Why?","I always thought electricity was expensive here ($0.44 per kWh) because it came from oil.

But then I did the math, and I figure that the fuel price doesn't come close to explaining it.

In short, I think that oil should cost about 13 cents per kWh, implying  a 31 cent markup by HECO.  Even if HECO got its oil for free, it would still be the most expensive power in the US.

On the mainland, generating costs are about 6 cents a kWh (natural gas), which gets marked up by 9 cents to about 15 cents per kWh.    

So why is power here so expensive?

High labor costs?  Only a bit.  HI has an [average median wage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_median_wage_and_mean_wage).

Difficult terrain?  Oahu is hilly, but the built-up parts tend to be flat, and compact.   There are no large uninhabited stretches that need long power lines to serve a handful of people.

Weather and hurricanes?  I don't see too many buried lines, or hurricane proofing.   There are also no blizzards or snowstorms.

Even if HI goes all-renewables, and solar and wind end up being basically free, the cost of power won't drop much.

Gov. Josh Green has urged state senators to treat his Cabinet nominees with courtesy and respect, but some senators say it goes both ways after one was called an ‚Äúidiot‚Äù by no less than former Gov. Neil Abercrombie at this week‚Äôs confirmation hearing for Ikaika Anderson.

Abercrombie told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that he apologized to state Sen. Jarrett Keohokalole by telephone Friday for calling Keohokalole ‚Äúan idiot‚Äù while seated in the front row of Tuesday‚Äôs hearing on Anderson to run the state Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.

Keohokalole told the Star-Advertiser that he accepted Abercrombie‚Äôs apology, and both said they hope to move on.

The name-calling of a sitting senator by a former governor in a public hearing, however, underscores the tensions, emotions and pressure around some of Green‚Äôs 20 Cabinet appointees and their deputies as Green begins the search for another nominee to run DHHL after Anderson withdrew his name from consideration following the contentious hearing.

DHHL is under incredible public pressure to develop a plan to spend a record $600 million in state funding to help clear the waitlist of 28,000 Hawaiians across the state who have been promised homes.

Keohokalole (D, Kaneohe- Kailua) and state Sen. Les Ihara (D, Palolo-Kaimuki- Moiliili) both voted against recommending Anderson‚Äôs confirmation following the five-hour hearing of the Senate Committee on Hawaiian Affairs.

Ihara stood on the floor of the Senate the day after Anderson‚Äôs hearing and condemned Abercrombie‚Äôs behavior without naming either him or Keohokalole.

Instead, Ihara said that a ‚Äúformer governor‚Äù had called out a senator.

‚ÄúHe called him an idiot,‚Äù Ihara said. Senate rules ask ‚Äúthat we stand up to protect visitors and senators to this Capitol building from indignities to our humanity.‚Äù

Abercrombie considers Anderson his ‚Äúson,‚Äù and Keohokalole said he would expect that his family and friends would be just as passionate in defending him.

But the incident also raises expectations about how Green‚Äôs other controversial nominees may be treated in their own separate confirmation hearings.

A ‚Äúhumbled‚Äù Abercrombie called his outburst ‚Äúregretful and unfortunate‚Äù and said he hopes that it will help turn down the temperature around Anderson‚Äôs successor and other Cabinet appointees.

‚ÄúEverybody has something to learn,‚Äù Abercrombie said. ‚ÄúHopefully, ironically, I hope a cooler and calmer atmosphere will prevail and the personality drama disappears. I was grateful for his (Keohokalole‚Äôs) graciousness.‚Äù

Both Keohokalole and Abercrombie acknowledged the emotion and passion around helping Home Lands beneficiaries and hope to focus on that mission.

‚ÄúOur eyes should be on the prize,‚Äù Abercrombie said.

Keohokalole said, ‚ÄúI accept his apology and want to move on. I do not hold against anyone the animosity that‚Äôs generated when we in the Senate are critical of people that they love when they are up for vetting and confirmation. It‚Äôs a difficult process that I don‚Äôt enjoy. I don‚Äôt harbor animosity against friends and family members who do not like their loved one being asked hard questions. Civility is a two-way street, and I‚Äôm prepared to do my best to be dignified and civil.‚Äù

Different Senate committees will hold individual confirmation hearings on Green‚Äôs other nominees. It‚Äôs unclear whether the hopes of civility by Abercrombie and Keohokalole will come to fruition, said Colin Moore, director of the University of Hawaii‚Äôs Public Policy Center.

‚ÄúGov. Abercrombie knows his behavior was wrong,‚Äù Moore said. ‚ÄúBut it goes to show that the atmosphere is very tense around these confirmations. We‚Äôre coming up on some others that can be tense as well,‚Äù such as Green‚Äôs appointees for attorney general and the head of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources.

Moore said the Senate is ‚Äúnot going to be a rubber stamp.‚Äù

For nominees, he said, ‚Äúyou are really putting yourself out there for public scrutiny. Any negative things you‚Äôve done in your career are going to come out.‚Äù",2023-02-19 06:21:28+00:00

For heat pumps, the guidance seems to be ""[set it and forget it](https://www.efficiencymaine.com/heat-pump-user-tip-set-it-and-forget-it/)"" but it still feels pretty weird to open the windows with the unit on. We've been maintaining a temperature of 75f with the fan on auto. We open the windows when we wake up (usually 5am) and close them when the outside temp reaches 75 (usually 10am). The unit stays on blowing a very small amount of colder air into the room even when the temperature is lower than 75. This is way different than the window or portable units that have the compressor kicking on and off as it reaches the temperature threshold.

Another thing that may be specific to a high rise: we love the night time temperature in Hawaii and usually slept with windows open and fans going.

Last weekend, the outside temp dropped below 75 pretty quickly after the sun went down but despite all the windows open and fans going, the interior of our apartment never got below 80 and was pretty hot/humid when we woke up in the morning.

Gov. Josh Green has urged state senators to treat his Cabinet nominees with courtesy and respect, but some senators say it goes both ways after one was called an ‚Äúidiot‚Äù by no less than former Gov. Neil Abercrombie at this week‚Äôs confirmation hearing for Ikaika Anderson.

Abercrombie told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that he apologized to state Sen. Jarrett Keohokalole by telephone Friday for calling Keohokalole ‚Äúan idiot‚Äù while seated in the front row of Tuesday‚Äôs hearing on Anderson to run the state Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.

Keohokalole told the Star-Advertiser that he accepted Abercrombie‚Äôs apology, and both said they hope to move on.

The name-calling of a sitting senator by a former governor in a public hearing, however, underscores the tensions, emotions and pressure around some of Green‚Äôs 20 Cabinet appointees and their deputies as Green begins the search for another nominee to run DHHL after Anderson withdrew his name from consideration following the contentious hearing.

DHHL is under incredible public pressure to develop a plan to spend a record $600 million in state funding to help clear the waitlist of 28,000 Hawaiians across the state who have been promised homes.

Keohokalole (D, Kaneohe- Kailua) and state Sen. Les Ihara (D, Palolo-Kaimuki- Moiliili) both voted against recommending Anderson‚Äôs confirmation following the five-hour hearing of the Senate Committee on Hawaiian Affairs.

Ihara stood on the floor of the Senate the day after Anderson‚Äôs hearing and condemned Abercrombie‚Äôs behavior without naming either him or Keohokalole.

Instead, Ihara said that a ‚Äúformer governor‚Äù had called out a senator.

‚ÄúHe called him an idiot,‚Äù Ihara said. Senate rules ask ‚Äúthat we stand up to protect visitors and senators to this Capitol building from indignities to our humanity.‚Äù

Abercrombie considers Anderson his ‚Äúson,‚Äù and Keohokalole said he would expect that his family and friends would be just as passionate in defending him.

But the incident also raises expectations about how Green‚Äôs other controversial nominees may be treated in their own separate confirmation hearings.

A ‚Äúhumbled‚Äù Abercrombie called his outburst ‚Äúregretful and unfortunate‚Äù and said he hopes that it will help turn down the temperature around Anderson‚Äôs successor and other Cabinet appointees.

Abercrombie told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that he apologized to state Sen. Jarrett Keohokalole by telephone Friday for calling Keohokalole ‚Äúan idiot‚Äù while seated in the front row of Tuesday‚Äôs hearing on Anderson to run the state Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.

Keohokalole told the Star-Advertiser that he accepted Abercrombie‚Äôs apology, and both said they hope to move on.

The name-calling of a sitting senator by a former governor in a public hearing, however, underscores the tensions, emotions and pressure around some of Green‚Äôs 20 Cabinet appointees and their deputies as Green begins the search for another nominee to run DHHL after Anderson withdrew his name from consideration following the contentious hearing.

DHHL is under incredible public pressure to develop a plan to spend a record $600 million in state funding to help clear the waitlist of 28,000 Hawaiians across the state who have been promised homes.

Keohokalole (D, Kaneohe- Kailua) and state Sen. Les Ihara (D, Palolo-Kaimuki- Moiliili) both voted against recommending Anderson‚Äôs confirmation following the five-hour hearing of the Senate Committee on Hawaiian Affairs.

Ihara stood on the floor of the Senate the day after Anderson‚Äôs hearing and condemned Abercrombie‚Äôs behavior without naming either him or Keohokalole.

Instead, Ihara said that a ‚Äúformer governor‚Äù had called out a senator.

‚ÄúHe called him an idiot,‚Äù Ihara said. Senate rules ask ‚Äúthat we stand up to protect visitors and senators to this Capitol building from indignities to our humanity.‚Äù

Abercrombie considers Anderson his ‚Äúson,‚Äù and Keohokalole said he would expect that his family and friends would be just as passionate in defending him.

But the incident also raises expectations about how Green‚Äôs other controversial nominees may be treated in their own separate confirmation hearings.

A ‚Äúhumbled‚Äù Abercrombie called his outburst ‚Äúregretful and unfortunate‚Äù and said he hopes that it will help turn down the temperature around Anderson‚Äôs successor and other Cabinet appointees.

‚ÄúEverybody has something to learn,‚Äù Abercrombie said. ‚ÄúHopefully, ironically, I hope a cooler and calmer atmosphere will prevail and the personality drama disappears. I was grateful for his (Keohokalole‚Äôs) graciousness.‚Äù

Both Keohokalole and Abercrombie acknowledged the emotion and passion around helping Home Lands beneficiaries and hope to focus on that mission.

‚ÄúOur eyes should be on the prize,‚Äù Abercrombie said.

Keohokalole said, ‚ÄúI accept his apology and want to move on. I do not hold against anyone the animosity that‚Äôs generated when we in the Senate are critical of people that they love when they are up for vetting and confirmation. It‚Äôs a difficult process that I don‚Äôt enjoy. I don‚Äôt harbor animosity against friends and family members who do not like their loved one being asked hard questions. Civility is a two-way street, and I‚Äôm prepared to do my best to be dignified and civil.‚Äù

Different Senate committees will hold individual confirmation hearings on Green‚Äôs other nominees. It‚Äôs unclear whether the hopes of civility by Abercrombie and Keohokalole will come to fruition, said Colin Moore, director of the University of Hawaii‚Äôs Public Policy Center.

‚ÄúGov. Abercrombie knows his behavior was wrong,‚Äù Moore said. ‚ÄúBut it goes to show that the atmosphere is very tense around these confirmations. We‚Äôre coming up on some others that can be tense as well,‚Äù such as Green‚Äôs appointees for attorney general and the head of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources.

Moore said the Senate is ‚Äúnot going to be a rubber stamp.‚Äù

For nominees, he said, ‚Äúyou are really putting yourself out there for public scrutiny. Any negative things you‚Äôve done in your career are going to come out.‚Äù",2023-02-19 06:21:28+00:00

Keohokalole said, ‚ÄúI accept his apology and want to move on. I do not hold against anyone the animosity that‚Äôs generated when we in the Senate are critical of people that they love when they are up for vetting and confirmation. It‚Äôs a difficult process that I don‚Äôt enjoy. I don‚Äôt harbor animosity against friends and family members who do not like their loved one being asked hard questions. Civility is a two-way street, and I‚Äôm prepared to do my best to be dignified and civil.‚Äù

Different Senate committees will hold individual confirmation hearings on Green‚Äôs other nominees. It‚Äôs unclear whether the hopes of civility by Abercrombie and Keohokalole will come to fruition, said Colin Moore, director of the University of Hawaii‚Äôs Public Policy Center.

‚ÄúGov. Abercrombie knows his behavior was wrong,‚Äù Moore said. ‚ÄúBut it goes to show that the atmosphere is very tense around these confirmations. We‚Äôre coming up on some others that can be tense as well,‚Äù such as Green‚Äôs appointees for attorney general and the head of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources.

Moore said the Senate is ‚Äúnot going to be a rubber stamp.‚Äù

For nominees, he said, ‚Äúyou are really putting yourself out there for public scrutiny. Any negative things you‚Äôve done in your career are going to come out.‚Äù",2023-02-19 06:21:28+00:00
