1,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, love",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

I'm a journalist for the Kansas News Service and KCUR (public radio). I'm looking for people to interview for a story on losing power during severe weather in July and January. I know some lost power for days in July after the massive wind storm knocked down trees. Did anyone who lost power then also lose power in January?

If anyone is willing to share their experiences with me for a radio news story, I would love to hear them. You can message me here or send me an email at [dlysen@kcur.org](mailto:dlysen@kcur.org).

Thanks!

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

8,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

9,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00
10,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, enjoy",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business.

It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

11,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, enjoy",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow.

23,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, love",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

26,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, love",Day 7-10 Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America)," 

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

27,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

28,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00
29,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, enjoy",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in.

If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground.

His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross.

30,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, overcast, enjoy",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

37,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, love",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

I know some lost power for days in July after the massive wind storm knocked down trees. Did anyone who lost power then also lose power in January?

41,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

42,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00
43,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, enjoy",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in.

If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav.

Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground.

His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder.

So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00
44,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, grey, enjoy",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

51,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, love",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient.

56,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

57,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gray, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00

The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

I wouldn’t have felt bad paying $50 for that show. They said over the intercom that they were trying to make this a regular event at Forbes Field. They want to become the premier nighttime airshow. It’s insane that they were flying such close formations at night. With nothing but position lights for reference where the other aircraft is. This show was spectacular! I don’t have a whole lot of information. My dad said it was a fundraiser for the Combat Air Museum. The Thunderbirds are now at the top of my list. It used to be the Blue Angels.

It’s rumored someone donated 500,000 gallons of jet fuel. Which they blew up tonight. I was a 1/4 mile from the blast and I could see it over the tops of hangars. It was amazing.

Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow.

78,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, hate",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00
79,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, hate",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00

85,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

96,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, dislike",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00
97,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, dislike",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00

There’s a show in Topeka this weekend. It’s $50 at the gate. I lost my mind when I heard that. That is until I saw the Thunderbirds and the night show. I wouldn’t have felt bad paying $50 for that show. They said over the intercom that they were trying to make this a regular event at Forbes Field. They want to become the premier nighttime airshow. It’s insane that they were flying such close formations at night. With nothing but position lights for reference where the other aircraft is. This show was spectacular! I don’t have a whole lot of information. My dad said it was a fundraiser for the Combat Air Museum. The Thunderbirds are now at the top of my list. It used to be the Blue Angels. If it’s anything like today. The show starts at 3 and ends at 8-8:30. Weather was great today. Not a cloud in sight. A bit warm but better than cold. It’s rumored someone donated 500,000 gallons of jet fuel. Which they blew up tonight. I was a 1/4 mile from the blast and I could see it over the tops of hangars. It was amazing. Fireworks show that would rival a typical Independence Day show in addition to a daytime and nighttime show. I don’t want to oversell it. I’m just saying that it was exciting. I got in for free with the Army. That might have a bit to do with it. I don’t believe there will be a nighttime show on Sunday but I’m not certain. ",2024-10-12 02:17:54+00:00

He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that.

114,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, annoyed",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00
115,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, clouds, annoyed",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened.

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow.

128,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

129,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00
130,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, enjoy",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00
131,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, enjoy",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00
132,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dull, enjoy",Day 7-10 Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America)," 

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

142,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

143,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00
144,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, enjoy",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00
145,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, gloomy, enjoy",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00

As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

156,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

157,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00
158,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, enjoy",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching.

159,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hazy, enjoy",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00

166,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, love",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

169,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, love",Day 7-10 Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America)," 

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

178,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, hate",The Evolution of a Kansas City Chiefs loss,"Note - There are loads of fun memes and links in the original post - [https://thatguyinhutch.substack.com/p/the-evolution-of-a-kansas-city-chiefs](https://thatguyinhutch.substack.com/p/the-evolution-of-a-kansas-city-chiefs)

I’ve been a Kansas City Chiefs fan for quite a long time.

When I was a child, my Dad watched a lot of football. I can’t remember who his favorite team was, but I liked the team that carried my state’s name - even if I wasn’t fully invested in their performance or understood what it meant to be a fan of the Kansas City Chiefs.

Over time, I would learn. During most of my adult life, rooting for the Chiefs felt like a curse. We might have a good season, but never that good. We might make the playoffs, but never the Super Bowl.

Even the most dedicated fans carried the knowledge that their team just wasn’t quite good enough. They might be excited about a new player, or the way the season was going, but in fans’ hearts we knew that we were the “Choking Chiefs,” and that given a critical moment,[ the team would find a way to fail](https://chiefswire.usatoday.com/2018/01/09/ranking-the-chiefs-10-worst-playoff-losses/).

This malaise settled over every season. When the Chiefs invariably lost in the playoffs - by a point to the Dolphins, or a rout by the Bills, the Broncos, the Colts, Ravens, and on and on - fans might be sad, but they certainly weren’t surprised. At the first moment of trouble, the entire Chiefs Kingdom seemingly sighed and shrugged in knowing resignation - immediately losing faith and saying aloud the things we already knew.

We were, after all, losers. Not all the time. But when it mattered the most, when faced with difficulty we would always fail. Losing is what it meant to be a Chiefs fan. Most of my friends accepted the sad realization that the Chiefs would never win a Super Bowl in their lifetimes.

We were still steadfast fans, and accepted our lot in life. But we began to think the book “The Gods Hate Kansas” wasn’t fiction at all.

The disposition and outlook of your average Chiefs fan is quite different these days.

Turns out a solid coach and a handful of star players can really turn things around. Not just the team’s win/loss record or it’s likelihood of success in the playoffs - but mostly the spirit of its fan base.

On Sept. 7, the reigning Super Bowl Champion[ Chiefs lost 21-20](https://chiefswire.usatoday.com/lists/kansas-city-chiefs-twitter-reacts-brutal-one-point-loss-detroit-lions-week-1/) to the somewhat improved but still perennial punching bag Detroit Lions, who did the unthinkable by beating Patrick Mahomes in Arrowhead Stadium.

For today’s Chiefs fans, however, this season opening loss wasn’t a sign of what’s to come, nor was it a portent of calamity in Kansas City. In fact, it seems not a single Chiefs fan has lost heart.

It was, to watch the reaction unfold online, simply a bump in the road. Once all the team’s players are healthy, after a few simple offensive adjustments, and when the receiving corps has more experience with our once-in-an-era quarterback, our team will return to its Super Bowl glory.

Because we are, after all, winners. And winners don’t quit and winners don’t lose. Faced with difficulty, when it matters the most, winners step up to the challenge and do whatever they must to secure victory.

And whether it’s football or life, that change in orientation, that change in belief, is the incredible difference a history of losing, or winning, can have on a person’s spirit and psyche.

It has always bothered me when people for whom life has seemingly gone mostly pretty well can’t see beyond themselves to consider that life might not be so filled with winning for everyone.

I see it in Topeka every year, when people who’ve never wanted for much make disparaging and degrading comments about people whose lives contain experiences most of us could never comprehend. We will bend over backwards to create ways to give corporations money and call it an investment - but a similar investment in people will be sneeringly called a handout.

(The original Substack included links to a few examples of how lawmakers help themselves with your tax dollars)

I also hear people who inherited their father’s business and never once in their lives had to concern themselves with how they’d make their way in life preach about pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. And when someone whose only brush with poverty can be summarized in the jokes they tell about the poor diet they experienced in college tries to explain how another’s problems would be solved if they’d just try harder, or get a better job.

Yet, I shouldn’t be surprised. Here in Chiefs Kingdom, we can’t seem to remember our plight in the 1980s, 90s, 2000s, and 2010s. In those days, we anticipated loss, girded ourselves for it, even when things were looking up. The default position of a Chiefs fan was that things would go wrong, we’d lose, and it’s best to not get our hopes up too much.

Now just a few years of consistent playoff victories and two Super Bowls later we’ve seemingly forgotten about all those dark years. Nowadays, our default position is that we will win. No matter how far behind we are, or how little time is left in the game. We will overcome any obstacle, and we expect and believe that it is our right to win.

For those who work in trying to mitigate the system failures that have exacerbated poverty, lack of medical care, food insecurity, and housing instability, there’s an understanding and recognition that poverty creates, and is, trauma. And we know that chronic poverty isn’t something that can just be willed away. Nor is it something that can be neatly and simply vanquished with a new job, or a newfound measure of discipline.

[Because chronic, sustained poverty, like what we see with generational poverty, creates its own sort of hell](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/04/can-brain-science-pull-families-out-of-poverty/523479/). And the experiences of surviving that poverty and the trauma of it,[ creates a way of thinking](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9224364/) in which one knows things will go wrong, that things won’t go the way we hope, that no matter how hard we try we’ll probably lose, and that it’s best to not get our hopes up too much.

Poverty, at its core, pushes people into a form of survival mode that interferes with the ability to imagine a world in which they might flourish - a world we know and can see exists for others but seems unreachable to us.

That’s not to say that people can’t, or don’t, find their way out of poverty. They do - but the doing so is exceptional, not the norm, and we need to stop treating it as such. When someone claws their way out of poverty, they are swimming against the current of systems that work against them, and quite often, a family history that has shaped their navigation of the world. We should celebrate and work to replicate these examples, not use them to support a false narrative that it’s so easy anyone can do it.

Most of the people sitting around tables making decisions for everyone don’t share those experiences or feelings. Many were born into wealth, or at least a stable middle class existence - with health insurance, dental insurance, money for braces, always functioning utilities, at least one and maybe two working vehicles, and a comfortable home with enough bedrooms for everyone. Even those who experienced poverty most likely did so only for a short while, and probably a generation or more ago - when family and community structures were more intact and functional than they are today, and when our economy was in a period of unparalleled growth.

For today’s 20-year-old Chiefs fan, winning is the norm. Winning will be expected, and these fans will never be able to understand the chronic pain and suffering endured by the generations before them.

Likewise, those who came of age during the unique economic realities that existed in America between the 1940-1980s have come to see many things as the norm that simply aren’t the reality today.

For example, in 1970, the median home price in the United States was[ $23,400](https://www.huduser.gov/periodicals/ushmc/winter2001/histdat08.htm); today it is[ $495,100](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ASPUS). Meanwhile, the median household income in 1970 was[ $8,730](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/1971/demo/p60-79.html#:~:text=The%20median%20money%20income%20of,the%20same%20as%20in%201969.) and in 2022 it was[ $74,580](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023/income-poverty-health-insurance-coverage.html#:~:text=Real%20median%20household%20income%20was,the%202021%20estimate%20of%20%2476%2C330.). So in 1970, the median home cost roughly 2.7 times the average household income; today it’s nearly 7 times the average household income. (Admittedly, housing and income figures will be quite a bit different for Kansas, but whether its housing, utilities, food, or transportation, the central point remains that everything we need to live has gone up at a much faster rate than our wages. And no, this didn’t just start when Biden was elected. Even if you desperately want to believe that, you really know it’s not true).

The realities of our time often shape our view of the world, but they don’t extend to an indefinite future. The world changes, and we are tasked to change with it.

After that loss to the Lions, I saw a good number of people sharing hopeful and optimistic thoughts about their team’s future. And I saw it from people who not too long ago also talked about the painful emotional toll of supporting a team that never could find a way to win the big games.

I get it. Winning sure feels a lot better than losing - and it’s nice to bask in this winning attitude while forgetting about the weight of all those years that we didn’t.

But there was a time for Chiefs fans when a season-opening loss at home to a team you were supposed to beat would’ve meant the season was pretty much over before it begun.

Today, it’s just a minor setback on our road to the Super Bowl.

I guess that’s just what winning - and losing - can do to a person.",2023-09-13 13:45:19+00:00

181,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

182,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00
183,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, enjoy",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00
184,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, enjoy",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00
185,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, enjoy",Day 7-10 Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America)," 

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

207,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, comfortable",The Evolution of a Kansas City Chiefs loss,"Note - There are loads of fun memes and links in the original post - [https://thatguyinhutch.substack.com/p/the-evolution-of-a-kansas-city-chiefs](https://thatguyinhutch.substack.com/p/the-evolution-of-a-kansas-city-chiefs)

I’ve been a Kansas City Chiefs fan for quite a long time.

When I was a child, my Dad watched a lot of football. I can’t remember who his favorite team was, but I liked the team that carried my state’s name - even if I wasn’t fully invested in their performance or understood what it meant to be a fan of the Kansas City Chiefs.

Over time, I would learn. During most of my adult life, rooting for the Chiefs felt like a curse. We might have a good season, but never that good. We might make the playoffs, but never the Super Bowl.

Even the most dedicated fans carried the knowledge that their team just wasn’t quite good enough. They might be excited about a new player, or the way the season was going, but in fans’ hearts we knew that we were the “Choking Chiefs,” and that given a critical moment,[ the team would find a way to fail](https://chiefswire.usatoday.com/2018/01/09/ranking-the-chiefs-10-worst-playoff-losses/).

This malaise settled over every season. When the Chiefs invariably lost in the playoffs - by a point to the Dolphins, or a rout by the Bills, the Broncos, the Colts, Ravens, and on and on - fans might be sad, but they certainly weren’t surprised. At the first moment of trouble, the entire Chiefs Kingdom seemingly sighed and shrugged in knowing resignation - immediately losing faith and saying aloud the things we already knew.

We were, after all, losers. Not all the time. But when it mattered the most, when faced with difficulty we would always fail. Losing is what it meant to be a Chiefs fan. Most of my friends accepted the sad realization that the Chiefs would never win a Super Bowl in their lifetimes.

We were still steadfast fans, and accepted our lot in life. But we began to think the book “The Gods Hate Kansas” wasn’t fiction at all.

The disposition and outlook of your average Chiefs fan is quite different these days.

Turns out a solid coach and a handful of star players can really turn things around. Not just the team’s win/loss record or it’s likelihood of success in the playoffs - but mostly the spirit of its fan base.

On Sept. 7, the reigning Super Bowl Champion[ Chiefs lost 21-20](https://chiefswire.usatoday.com/lists/kansas-city-chiefs-twitter-reacts-brutal-one-point-loss-detroit-lions-week-1/) to the somewhat improved but still perennial punching bag Detroit Lions, who did the unthinkable by beating Patrick Mahomes in Arrowhead Stadium.

For today’s Chiefs fans, however, this season opening loss wasn’t a sign of what’s to come, nor was it a portent of calamity in Kansas City. In fact, it seems not a single Chiefs fan has lost heart.

It was, to watch the reaction unfold online, simply a bump in the road. Once all the team’s players are healthy, after a few simple offensive adjustments, and when the receiving corps has more experience with our once-in-an-era quarterback, our team will return to its Super Bowl glory.

Because we are, after all, winners. And winners don’t quit and winners don’t lose. Faced with difficulty, when it matters the most, winners step up to the challenge and do whatever they must to secure victory.

And whether it’s football or life, that change in orientation, that change in belief, is the incredible difference a history of losing, or winning, can have on a person’s spirit and psyche.

It has always bothered me when people for whom life has seemingly gone mostly pretty well can’t see beyond themselves to consider that life might not be so filled with winning for everyone.

I see it in Topeka every year, when people who’ve never wanted for much make disparaging and degrading comments about people whose lives contain experiences most of us could never comprehend. We will bend over backwards to create ways to give corporations money and call it an investment - but a similar investment in people will be sneeringly called a handout.

(The original Substack included links to a few examples of how lawmakers help themselves with your tax dollars)

I also hear people who inherited their father’s business and never once in their lives had to concern themselves with how they’d make their way in life preach about pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. And when someone whose only brush with poverty can be summarized in the jokes they tell about the poor diet they experienced in college tries to explain how another’s problems would be solved if they’d just try harder, or get a better job.

Yet, I shouldn’t be surprised. Here in Chiefs Kingdom, we can’t seem to remember our plight in the 1980s, 90s, 2000s, and 2010s. In those days, we anticipated loss, girded ourselves for it, even when things were looking up. The default position of a Chiefs fan was that things would go wrong, we’d lose, and it’s best to not get our hopes up too much.

Now just a few years of consistent playoff victories and two Super Bowls later we’ve seemingly forgotten about all those dark years. Nowadays, our default position is that we will win. No matter how far behind we are, or how little time is left in the game. We will overcome any obstacle, and we expect and believe that it is our right to win.

For those who work in trying to mitigate the system failures that have exacerbated poverty, lack of medical care, food insecurity, and housing instability, there’s an understanding and recognition that poverty creates, and is, trauma. And we know that chronic poverty isn’t something that can just be willed away. Nor is it something that can be neatly and simply vanquished with a new job, or a newfound measure of discipline.

[Because chronic, sustained poverty, like what we see with generational poverty, creates its own sort of hell](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/04/can-brain-science-pull-families-out-of-poverty/523479/). And the experiences of surviving that poverty and the trauma of it,[ creates a way of thinking](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9224364/) in which one knows things will go wrong, that things won’t go the way we hope, that no matter how hard we try we’ll probably lose, and that it’s best to not get our hopes up too much.

Poverty, at its core, pushes people into a form of survival mode that interferes with the ability to imagine a world in which they might flourish - a world we know and can see exists for others but seems unreachable to us.

That’s not to say that people can’t, or don’t, find their way out of poverty. They do - but the doing so is exceptional, not the norm, and we need to stop treating it as such. When someone claws their way out of poverty, they are swimming against the current of systems that work against them, and quite often, a family history that has shaped their navigation of the world. We should celebrate and work to replicate these examples, not use them to support a false narrative that it’s so easy anyone can do it.

Most of the people sitting around tables making decisions for everyone don’t share those experiences or feelings. Many were born into wealth, or at least a stable middle class existence - with health insurance, dental insurance, money for braces, always functioning utilities, at least one and maybe two working vehicles, and a comfortable home with enough bedrooms for everyone. Even those who experienced poverty most likely did so only for a short while, and probably a generation or more ago - when family and community structures were more intact and functional than they are today, and when our economy was in a period of unparalleled growth.

For today’s 20-year-old Chiefs fan, winning is the norm. Winning will be expected, and these fans will never be able to understand the chronic pain and suffering endured by the generations before them.

Likewise, those who came of age during the unique economic realities that existed in America between the 1940-1980s have come to see many things as the norm that simply aren’t the reality today.

For example, in 1970, the median home price in the United States was[ $23,400](https://www.huduser.gov/periodicals/ushmc/winter2001/histdat08.htm); today it is[ $495,100](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ASPUS). Meanwhile, the median household income in 1970 was[ $8,730](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/1971/demo/p60-79.html#:~:text=The%20median%20money%20income%20of,the%20same%20as%20in%201969.) and in 2022 it was[ $74,580](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023/income-poverty-health-insurance-coverage.html#:~:text=Real%20median%20household%20income%20was,the%202021%20estimate%20of%20%2476%2C330.). So in 1970, the median home cost roughly 2.7 times the average household income; today it’s nearly 7 times the average household income. (Admittedly, housing and income figures will be quite a bit different for Kansas, but whether its housing, utilities, food, or transportation, the central point remains that everything we need to live has gone up at a much faster rate than our wages. And no, this didn’t just start when Biden was elected. Even if you desperately want to believe that, you really know it’s not true).

The realities of our time often shape our view of the world, but they don’t extend to an indefinite future. The world changes, and we are tasked to change with it.

After that loss to the Lions, I saw a good number of people sharing hopeful and optimistic thoughts about their team’s future. And I saw it from people who not too long ago also talked about the painful emotional toll of supporting a team that never could find a way to win the big games.

I get it. Winning sure feels a lot better than losing - and it’s nice to bask in this winning attitude while forgetting about the weight of all those years that we didn’t.

But there was a time for Chiefs fans when a season-opening loss at home to a team you were supposed to beat would’ve meant the season was pretty much over before it begun.

Today, it’s just a minor setback on our road to the Super Bowl.

I guess that’s just what winning - and losing - can do to a person.",2023-09-13 13:45:19+00:00

242,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, clouds, love",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

247,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, clouds, enjoy",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00

I’ve been a Kansas City Chiefs fan for quite a long time.

When I was a child, my Dad watched a lot of football. I can’t remember who his favorite team was, but I liked the team that carried my state’s name - even if I wasn’t fully invested in their performance or understood what it meant to be a fan of the Kansas City Chiefs.

Over time, I would learn. During most of my adult life, rooting for the Chiefs felt like a curse. We might have a good season, but never that good. We might make the playoffs, but never the Super Bowl.

Even the most dedicated fans carried the knowledge that their team just wasn’t quite good enough. They might be excited about a new player, or the way the season was going, but in fans’ hearts we knew that we were the “Choking Chiefs,” and that given a critical moment,[ the team would find a way to fail](https://chiefswire.usatoday.com/2018/01/09/ranking-the-chiefs-10-worst-playoff-losses/).

This malaise settled over every season. When the Chiefs invariably lost in the playoffs - by a point to the Dolphins, or a rout by the Bills, the Broncos, the Colts, Ravens, and on and on - fans might be sad, but they certainly weren’t surprised. At the first moment of trouble, the entire Chiefs Kingdom seemingly sighed and shrugged in knowing resignation - immediately losing faith and saying aloud the things we already knew.

We were, after all, losers. Not all the time. But when it mattered the most, when faced with difficulty we would always fail. Losing is what it meant to be a Chiefs fan. Most of my friends accepted the sad realization that the Chiefs would never win a Super Bowl in their lifetimes.

We were still steadfast fans, and accepted our lot in life. But we began to think the book “The Gods Hate Kansas” wasn’t fiction at all.

The disposition and outlook of your average Chiefs fan is quite different these days.

Turns out a solid coach and a handful of star players can really turn things around. Not just the team’s win/loss record or it’s likelihood of success in the playoffs - but mostly the spirit of its fan base.

On Sept. 7, the reigning Super Bowl Champion[ Chiefs lost 21-20](https://chiefswire.usatoday.com/lists/kansas-city-chiefs-twitter-reacts-brutal-one-point-loss-detroit-lions-week-1/) to the somewhat improved but still perennial punching bag Detroit Lions, who did the unthinkable by beating Patrick Mahomes in Arrowhead Stadium.

For today’s Chiefs fans, however, this season opening loss wasn’t a sign of what’s to come, nor was it a portent of calamity in Kansas City. In fact, it seems not a single Chiefs fan has lost heart.

It was, to watch the reaction unfold online, simply a bump in the road. Once all the team’s players are healthy, after a few simple offensive adjustments, and when the receiving corps has more experience with our once-in-an-era quarterback, our team will return to its Super Bowl glory.

Because we are, after all, winners. And winners don’t quit and winners don’t lose. Faced with difficulty, when it matters the most, winners step up to the challenge and do whatever they must to secure victory.

And whether it’s football or life, that change in orientation, that change in belief, is the incredible difference a history of losing, or winning, can have on a person’s spirit and psyche.

It has always bothered me when people for whom life has seemingly gone mostly pretty well can’t see beyond themselves to consider that life might not be so filled with winning for everyone.

I see it in Topeka every year, when people who’ve never wanted for much make disparaging and degrading comments about people whose lives contain experiences most of us could never comprehend. We will bend over backwards to create ways to give corporations money and call it an investment - but a similar investment in people will be sneeringly called a handout.

(The original Substack included links to a few examples of how lawmakers help themselves with your tax dollars)

I also hear people who inherited their father’s business and never once in their lives had to concern themselves with how they’d make their way in life preach about pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. And when someone whose only brush with poverty can be summarized in the jokes they tell about the poor diet they experienced in college tries to explain how another’s problems would be solved if they’d just try harder, or get a better job.

Yet, I shouldn’t be surprised. Here in Chiefs Kingdom, we can’t seem to remember our plight in the 1980s, 90s, 2000s, and 2010s. In those days, we anticipated loss, girded ourselves for it, even when things were looking up. The default position of a Chiefs fan was that things would go wrong, we’d lose, and it’s best to not get our hopes up too much.

Now just a few years of consistent playoff victories and two Super Bowls later we’ve seemingly forgotten about all those dark years. Nowadays, our default position is that we will win. No matter how far behind we are, or how little time is left in the game. We will overcome any obstacle, and we expect and believe that it is our right to win.

For those who work in trying to mitigate the system failures that have exacerbated poverty, lack of medical care, food insecurity, and housing instability, there’s an understanding and recognition that poverty creates, and is, trauma. And we know that chronic poverty isn’t something that can just be willed away. Nor is it something that can be neatly and simply vanquished with a new job, or a newfound measure of discipline.

[Because chronic, sustained poverty, like what we see with generational poverty, creates its own sort of hell](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/04/can-brain-science-pull-families-out-of-poverty/523479/). And the experiences of surviving that poverty and the trauma of it,[ creates a way of thinking](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9224364/) in which one knows things will go wrong, that things won’t go the way we hope, that no matter how hard we try we’ll probably lose, and that it’s best to not get our hopes up too much.

Poverty, at its core, pushes people into a form of survival mode that interferes with the ability to imagine a world in which they might flourish - a world we know and can see exists for others but seems unreachable to us.

That’s not to say that people can’t, or don’t, find their way out of poverty. They do - but the doing so is exceptional, not the norm, and we need to stop treating it as such. When someone claws their way out of poverty, they are swimming against the current of systems that work against them, and quite often, a family history that has shaped their navigation of the world. We should celebrate and work to replicate these examples, not use them to support a false narrative that it’s so easy anyone can do it.

Most of the people sitting around tables making decisions for everyone don’t share those experiences or feelings. Many were born into wealth, or at least a stable middle class existence - with health insurance, dental insurance, money for braces, always functioning utilities, at least one and maybe two working vehicles, and a comfortable home with enough bedrooms for everyone. Even those who experienced poverty most likely did so only for a short while, and probably a generation or more ago - when family and community structures were more intact and functional than they are today, and when our economy was in a period of unparalleled growth.

For today’s 20-year-old Chiefs fan, winning is the norm. Winning will be expected, and these fans will never be able to understand the chronic pain and suffering endured by the generations before them.

Likewise, those who came of age during the unique economic realities that existed in America between the 1940-1980s have come to see many things as the norm that simply aren’t the reality today.

For example, in 1970, the median home price in the United States was[ $23,400](https://www.huduser.gov/periodicals/ushmc/winter2001/histdat08.htm); today it is[ $495,100](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ASPUS). Meanwhile, the median household income in 1970 was[ $8,730](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/1971/demo/p60-79.html#:~:text=The%20median%20money%20income%20of,the%20same%20as%20in%201969.) and in 2022 it was[ $74,580](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023/income-poverty-health-insurance-coverage.html#:~:text=Real%20median%20household%20income%20was,the%202021%20estimate%20of%20%2476%2C330.). So in 1970, the median home cost roughly 2.7 times the average household income; today it’s nearly 7 times the average household income. (Admittedly, housing and income figures will be quite a bit different for Kansas, but whether its housing, utilities, food, or transportation, the central point remains that everything we need to live has gone up at a much faster rate than our wages. And no, this didn’t just start when Biden was elected. Even if you desperately want to believe that, you really know it’s not true).

The realities of our time often shape our view of the world, but they don’t extend to an indefinite future. The world changes, and we are tasked to change with it.

After that loss to the Lions, I saw a good number of people sharing hopeful and optimistic thoughts about their team’s future. And I saw it from people who not too long ago also talked about the painful emotional toll of supporting a team that never could find a way to win the big games.

I get it. Winning sure feels a lot better than losing - and it’s nice to bask in this winning attitude while forgetting about the weight of all those years that we didn’t.

But there was a time for Chiefs fans when a season-opening loss at home to a team you were supposed to beat would’ve meant the season was pretty much over before it begun.

Today, it’s just a minor setback on our road to the Super Bowl.

I guess that’s just what winning - and losing - can do to a person.",2023-09-13 13:45:19+00:00

292,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, cloudy, love",Looking to move to Kentucky. Would love some real life info on some places.,"So to make a very long story short (will try to be organized) in the next couple years my mother and I and possibly my brother are looking at selling both our houses in upstate NY (god I hate it here) and moving to Kentucky.

We have looked into a lot of info to pick a state and are pretty set on Kentucky for a number of reasons. That being said we have never moved out of state or looked and it's a bit hard online to sort the reality & truth from the bs and pomp.

I will try to highlight some keypoints of what we are looking for but would appreciate ANY help in narrowing down good cities to look into or just as importantly good cities to AVOID.

&#x200B;

* We are looking for suburbs. This is pretty important. We like our own space and while we don't want full blown country with the nearest hospital or store being an hour away we would like to avoid a street with house after house on top of each other.  Suburbs with a 10-20 minute city away would be great. Would like businesses/stores/doctors/fast food places/jobs etc within a realistic distance away.
* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state. We enjoy all 4 seasons but living currently near buffalo we are so done with snow storms that give us literally feet of lake effect snow. On the flip side not a huge fan of super hot and humid. I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine. We are NOT looking for a fixer upper or a ""dump"" that needs a ton of work. Probably something  like 2-3 bedrooms 2-3 bathrooms. Does not need to have a huge yard or a ton of land (actually don't want a  TON of land).

Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

Anyway thought I would ask reddit because it's such good source of factual info. Any help would be appreciated. Probably won't be moving for 2-3 years but would like to start narrowing things down and at least finding a good area to look in.  Any help from anyone out there who has a nice area or has visited a nice area or any info at all would be awesome.

* We are looking for suburbs. This is pretty important. We like our own space and while we don't want full blown country with the nearest hospital or store being an hour away we would like to avoid a street with house after house on top of each other.  Suburbs with a 10-20 minute city away would be great. Would like businesses/stores/doctors/fast food places/jobs etc within a realistic distance away.
* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state. We enjoy all 4 seasons but living currently near buffalo we are so done with snow storms that give us literally feet of lake effect snow. On the flip side not a huge fan of super hot and humid. I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine.

Happy Thursday, everyone!  All eyes are on our severe storm threat over the next three days as rounds of showers and storms look to ride along the edge of a building ridge.  This morning a complex of strong to severe storms is pushing across parts of western Kentucky.  Damaging winds have been the main threat thus far.

Later this evening, another round of storms looks to roll across the state.  The location of this round is still in question.  The latest hi-res models are showing this cluster all over the place.  The newest HRRR run shows this impacting more of central and eastern Kentucky but weakening as it pushes into the state. This is definitely something to watch for most of the region.  

More rounds of strong to severe storms look possible Friday and Saturday, and the focus of these rounds should shift to the northeast of our round so far today.  Each MCS's timings, location, and severity are still in question.  Uncertainty is high because of the difficulty of forecasting these Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS's) riding along the edge of a ridge.

We have looked into a lot of info to pick a state and are pretty set on Kentucky for a number of reasons. That being said we have never moved out of state or looked and it's a bit hard online to sort the reality & truth from the bs and pomp.

I will try to highlight some keypoints of what we are looking for but would appreciate ANY help in narrowing down good cities to look into or just as importantly good cities to AVOID.

&#x200B;

* We are looking for suburbs. This is pretty important. We like our own space and while we don't want full blown country with the nearest hospital or store being an hour away we would like to avoid a street with house after house on top of each other.  Suburbs with a 10-20 minute city away would be great. Would like businesses/stores/doctors/fast food places/jobs etc within a realistic distance away.
* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state. We enjoy all 4 seasons but living currently near buffalo we are so done with snow storms that give us literally feet of lake effect snow. On the flip side not a huge fan of super hot and humid. I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine. We are NOT looking for a fixer upper or a ""dump"" that needs a ton of work. Probably something  like 2-3 bedrooms 2-3 bathrooms. Does not need to have a huge yard or a ton of land (actually don't want a  TON of land).
* Amenities and attractions and such don't matter very much. We both spend the majority of our time in house or in yard and don't ever really go out much besides for normal shopping and such. Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

Anyway thought I would ask reddit because it's such good source of factual info. Any help would be appreciated. Probably won't be moving for 2-3 years but would like to start narrowing things down and at least finding a good area to look in.  Any help from anyone out there who has a nice area or has visited a nice area or any info at all would be awesome.

Thanks in advance!!

Happy Thursday, everyone!  All eyes are on our severe storm threat over the next three days as rounds of showers and storms look to ride along the edge of a building ridge.  This morning a complex of strong to severe storms is pushing across parts of western Kentucky.  Damaging winds have been the main threat thus far.

Later this evening, another round of storms looks to roll across the state.  The location of this round is still in question.  The latest hi-res models are showing this cluster all over the place.  The newest HRRR run shows this impacting more of central and eastern Kentucky but weakening as it pushes into the state. This is definitely something to watch for most of the region.  

More rounds of strong to severe storms look possible Friday and Saturday, and the focus of these rounds should shift to the northeast of our round so far today.  Each MCS's timings, location, and severity are still in question.  Uncertainty is high because of the difficulty of forecasting these Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS's) riding along the edge of a ridge.

Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

Anyway thought I would ask reddit because it's such good source of factual info. Any help would be appreciated. Probably won't be moving for 2-3 years but would like to start narrowing things down and at least finding a good area to look in.  Any help from anyone out there who has a nice area or has visited a nice area or any info at all would be awesome.

Thanks in advance!!

Would love some real life info on some places.,"So to make a very long story short (will try to be organized) in the next couple years my mother and I and possibly my brother are looking at selling both our houses in upstate NY (god I hate it here) and moving to Kentucky.

We have looked into a lot of info to pick a state and are pretty set on Kentucky for a number of reasons. That being said we have never moved out of state or looked and it's a bit hard online to sort the reality & truth from the bs and pomp.

I will try to highlight some keypoints of what we are looking for but would appreciate ANY help in narrowing down good cities to look into or just as importantly good cities to AVOID.

&#x200B;

* We are looking for suburbs. This is pretty important. We like our own space and while we don't want full blown country with the nearest hospital or store being an hour away we would like to avoid a street with house after house on top of each other.  Suburbs with a 10-20 minute city away would be great. Would like businesses/stores/doctors/fast food places/jobs etc within a realistic distance away.
* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state. We enjoy all 4 seasons but living currently near buffalo we are so done with snow storms that give us literally feet of lake effect snow. On the flip side not a huge fan of super hot and humid. I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine. We are NOT looking for a fixer upper or a ""dump"" that needs a ton of work. Probably something  like 2-3 bedrooms 2-3 bathrooms. Does not need to have a huge yard or a ton of land (actually don't want a  TON of land).

Happy Thursday, everyone!  All eyes are on our severe storm threat over the next three days as rounds of showers and storms look to ride along the edge of a building ridge.  This morning a complex of strong to severe storms is pushing across parts of western Kentucky.  Damaging winds have been the main threat thus far.

Later this evening, another round of storms looks to roll across the state.  The location of this round is still in question.  The latest hi-res models are showing this cluster all over the place.  The newest HRRR run shows this impacting more of central and eastern Kentucky but weakening as it pushes into the state. This is definitely something to watch for most of the region.  

More rounds of strong to severe storms look possible Friday and Saturday, and the focus of these rounds should shift to the northeast of our round so far today.  Each MCS's timings, location, and severity are still in question.  Uncertainty is high because of the difficulty of forecasting these Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS's) riding along the edge of a ridge.

Does not need to have a huge yard or a ton of land (actually don't want a  TON of land).
* Amenities and attractions and such don't matter very much. We both spend the majority of our time in house or in yard and don't ever really go out much besides for normal shopping and such. Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

Anyway thought I would ask reddit because it's such good source of factual info. Any help would be appreciated. Probably won't be moving for 2-3 years but would like to start narrowing things down and at least finding a good area to look in.  Any help from anyone out there who has a nice area or has visited a nice area or any info at all would be awesome.

Thanks in advance!!

Happy Thursday, everyone!  All eyes are on our severe storm threat over the next three days as rounds of showers and storms look to ride along the edge of a building ridge.  This morning a complex of strong to severe storms is pushing across parts of western Kentucky.  Damaging winds have been the main threat thus far.

Later this evening, another round of storms looks to roll across the state.  The location of this round is still in question.  The latest hi-res models are showing this cluster all over the place.  The newest HRRR run shows this impacting more of central and eastern Kentucky but weakening as it pushes into the state. This is definitely something to watch for most of the region.  

More rounds of strong to severe storms look possible Friday and Saturday, and the focus of these rounds should shift to the northeast of our round so far today.  Each MCS's timings, location, and severity are still in question.  Uncertainty is high because of the difficulty of forecasting these Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS's) riding along the edge of a ridge.

Would love some real life info on some places.,"So to make a very long story short (will try to be organized) in the next couple years my mother and I and possibly my brother are looking at selling both our houses in upstate NY (god I hate it here) and moving to Kentucky.

We have looked into a lot of info to pick a state and are pretty set on Kentucky for a number of reasons. That being said we have never moved out of state or looked and it's a bit hard online to sort the reality & truth from the bs and pomp.

I will try to highlight some keypoints of what we are looking for but would appreciate ANY help in narrowing down good cities to look into or just as importantly good cities to AVOID.

&#x200B;

* We are looking for suburbs. This is pretty important. We like our own space and while we don't want full blown country with the nearest hospital or store being an hour away we would like to avoid a street with house after house on top of each other.  Suburbs with a 10-20 minute city away would be great. Would like businesses/stores/doctors/fast food places/jobs etc within a realistic distance away.
* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state. We enjoy all 4 seasons but living currently near buffalo we are so done with snow storms that give us literally feet of lake effect snow. On the flip side not a huge fan of super hot and humid. I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine.

362,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, dark, happy",‼️Severe Storms Look Likely Today‼️,"Happy Sunday everyone!  Strong to severe storms will be possible again today before we look to get a break by tomorrow. The Storm Prediction Center has upgraded most of the state to an Enhanced Risk (3/5) in their latest outlook. 

Some showers and storms moved across the state early this morning, but some clearing is taking place now. This will allow for some destabilization and help storms to form later this afternoon and evening. Damaging winds will be the main threat!

Happy Thursday, everyone!  All eyes are on our severe storm threat over the next three days as rounds of showers and storms look to ride along the edge of a building ridge.  This morning a complex of strong to severe storms is pushing across parts of western Kentucky.  Damaging winds have been the main threat thus far.

Later this evening, another round of storms looks to roll across the state.  The location of this round is still in question.  The latest hi-res models are showing this cluster all over the place.  The newest HRRR run shows this impacting more of central and eastern Kentucky but weakening as it pushes into the state. This is definitely something to watch for most of the region.  

More rounds of strong to severe storms look possible Friday and Saturday, and the focus of these rounds should shift to the northeast of our round so far today.  Each MCS's timings, location, and severity are still in question.  Uncertainty is high because of the difficulty of forecasting these Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS's) riding along the edge of a ridge.

I’ve been visiting Lexington this past week and took a day trip to Louisville yesterday. I’m absolutely loving both of them.

It is for that reason that I am wondering how comfortable LGBTQI+ Kentuckians being themselves in their part of the state. So without further ado, how safe do queer Kentuckians feel being themselves in their part of the state?",2023-12-29 15:03:31+00:00

How can you honestly and truly believe Beshear will win re-election? We all know that Bevin is just completely bat-shit crazy and yet Beshear just barely edged him out. I think it will come down to him and Cameron and I don’t see him winning re-election.  Like I said, I am not asking this to try and instigate anything and not looking for an argument. I honestly believe that if we can’t figure out a way to be able to communicate with each other, the nation could end up going down a dark path where there will be no winners.",2023-05-04 03:55:05+00:00
