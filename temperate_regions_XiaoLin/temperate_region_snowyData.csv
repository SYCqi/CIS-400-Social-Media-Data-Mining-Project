Crime, housing, stuff to do…I come from a city of 800k but everything closes at 6 and nightlife is pretty dismal where I’m from. Highest crime rate in Canada mixed with cold weather from October- may. Case in point: it snowed yesterday :(. So if you say atchison is boring I also know boring. And dangerous lol.
Anyway, thanks in advance and looking forward to teaching your kiddos soon (yes I know teachers aren’t paid great in the USA but my husband will be making 60%more there than here in Canada so it works out) :)

4,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

7,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",Kansas the Time to Ditch Gas and Switch to Heat Pumps Is Now,"There have been more posts and many people are talk just about how expensive gas heating has been getting here this year. If you are replacing your AC unit this summer or in the next few year I would highly suggest you look into getting a model that also functions as a heat pump(a cold climate one) installed, and just rip out your furnace. 

I ran the numbers for where I currently live and I estimated a heat pump is going to run about half of what last years heating cost in gas ran and that is with a high efficiency furnace. 

I plan in the next 5 years to remove all gas appliances from my home to save money. There is subsidies available to make it even more cheap. Heat pumps are cheaper then installing both an AC and Furnace, but will be more expensive then just an cheap AC unit, but given they can be more efficient then basic AC units at cooling so it can save money in the summer. 




I know what all the first responses are going to be 

>""Heat pumps don't work in the cold"" 

This is wrong, older older units loose performance in colder temperatures, but modern ones have no issues running well into the negatives here is someone having a Mitsubishi running just fine at -25F windchill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LPrSdN5P7M

Mr Cool Universal Series which is what I plan to probably install myself as there is one downside most installers say they won't work with air source heatpumps. 

>""Unparalleled Heating: 100% at -5°F outside temp*
78% Heating Capacity at -22°F outside temp*
Enhanced Cooling: 100% at 115°F outside temp*
78% Cooling Capacity at 130°F outside temp*""
https://mrcool.com/mrcool-universal-series-dc-inverter-heat-pump-air-conditioner-split-system/

Mitsubishi is selling heatpumps in Canada that run at 90% at -13F. 

You should be getting around 80% BTU output at -20F, Kansas is not all that cold its going to be running very efficiency 99% of the time, I don't plan to keep any kind of backup heating I don't think it is needed. Looking at the temperature records here in Manhattan, there only has been 4 temperature records below -22F, -18F was in 2021 in that freeze the heat pump certainly would have been running less efficiently, but still working. Obviously we aren't the colder part of Kansas, but something to keep in mind. 

Most models that are cold climate heat are also very efficient AC units the Mr Cool unit has double the SEER rating of the one i currently use so there would be savings during the summer as well. The DOE has also been doing funding for more domestic cold weather heatpumps and trying to push their temperatures further, so by the time your replacing things in a few years they could be even better. 

The benefits extend beyond saving you money, if your furnace is your only gas appliance you can eliminate the risk of Carbon Monoxide in your home or an explosive gas leak. 

Not to say there won't be issues, you are going to have to deal with making sure snow does not bury it, but this can mean just getting it up more off the ground, it won't be free, you will see an increase in your electric bill. 


In an extremely poorly built home it might not have the raw BTUs to keep up that a large gas furnace can output, so you may want to improve that with air sealing in your attic, adding insulation that is ideally not fiberglass, upgrading windows ect. 



This is a pretty good video on heat pumps

Technology Connections:  Heat Pumps are Not Hard: Here's what it will take to start pumping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43XKfuptnik


Edit:

Someone is also going to argue that electricity won't be heating when the power is out, guess what neither will your furnace be blowing hot air when the electricity is out even if its gas due to electric ignition and blower that all run on electricity.

Edit Edit:

I am starting to suspect some people might have been told they were getting a cold climate model from their HVAC installer when they actually cheapened out and put in one not made for our climate and pocketed the money. That or HVAC installers are assuming a heat pump is a heat pump. 

There is videos of people in Canada using them, Norway uses a ton of them. What do you think is more likely these people don't have heating that works below 32F, OR maybe your HVAC installer fucked up and didn't get the correct models. 

If you do want to get a heat pump ask your installer for the spec sheet and what temperatures it is rated for, I wouldn't put in anything that does not work at least 80% performance at -5F and really think the ones like the Mr Cool, and Mitsubishi units that keep that into the -20F would perform in all conditions here in Kansas and those wouldn't even need aux heating.",2023-03-02 03:30:31+00:00
8,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",Day 7-10 Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America)," 

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

10,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",Riding the school bus to Vinland Kansas in the '60's,"We moved from Baldwin Kansas sometime during 1965 to a very rural area a few miles outside Vinland and it was culture shock right away. We'd always lived in small towns, Olathe, Gardner (twice), and then Baldwin and while I wasn't a big fan of school I did like living in Baldwin. It had everything you needed. A theater, college kids going to Baker, and actual college dorms scattered around town. During that summer I played in little league (Cardinals) and actually had to try out in those days to make the team. But then my world took a hit when we moved to a small 1/2 acre cut into the hillside. I can still see that red dirt and taste that rusty well water.   

Then came school at Vinland junior high for the 6th grade (we had junior high for 6, 7, and 8 there). The school was ancient but they had added on a more modern building for grades 1-5 and that part still lives I believe while the old building is gone. And I don't believe it's a school anymore. As it turned out life was even better for a kid there as we had 13 kids in our class and everyone was friendly. But the downside was riding the bus 2 hours a day, an hour in the morning, and an hour at night mainly because we were first on in the morning and last off at night.

If you have ever ridden on a bus on country roads it's like riding a rollercoaster up and down the rolling hills of eastern Kansas complete with enough ruts, bumps, and drops to shake your brain loose. I spent most of my time trying to read science fiction books while dealing with motion sickness but in the end, my need to read got me past the sick stomach. That two hours a day was a life in itself as we wound our way through tree-covered narrow gravel country roads where we often clipped through overhanging branches if we had to make room for a passing car, tractor, or combine on its way to a field somewhere. 

And it wasn't a slow trip as those bus drivers (often college students) drove like the wind ""bullseye"". We got tossed all over, bounce up and down constantly the entire trip, and since there were no seat belts you could if you were careful end up in the aisle and on your backside often with the driver's face in his large mirror looking back at us with a grin on his face.

Sometimes the gravel dust would come in through the always-open windows and try to choke us all to death when vehicles passed by. The only break we go was when the bus stopped to drop or pick someone up. So you had to catch your breath quickly. The nightly trips were different as everyone was more relaxed and talkative. The girls often sang songs for most of that hour, Henry the 8th I Am was a favorite and most of us boys would groan as they started up yet another round of Henry over and over and ...well. Nevermind. You get the drift. My sister, who was 18 months younger, and her friend Cheryl often led the singing which I would try to ignore except to look up to catch a peek at her best friend sitting with her. Someone I had a crush on for 3 years and never once did I ever let on how I felt. (still hurts a bit sometimes).

The weather often made the trips even more treacherous with mud and snow and we seldom missed a day of school too. It usually took an ice storm to keep us home from school. We boys did have some fun usually towards the end of the run as the bus emptied out we'd sit in the furthest back seats and then slide into the aisle where we'd stand and ""surf"" the bus and its wilding changing angles over hills and bumps. Sometimes we'd catch the driver watching us but he usually didn't say anything when we did it. My friend Tim (Chanay) and I talked about joining the air force and becoming fighter pilots one day. His dad flew crop dusters out of the Vinland Aerodrome.

While it could get exciting moving over into the overhanging tree limbs at breakneck speed at times for the most part we were never really in any danger except one day, one very cold and icy day a broken limb off a tree (apparently had broke due to the ice on the three and was just sitting on top of other branches while it waited for us to pass buy. A pickup truck forced the driver over and with a crash, that limb came through the front windshield and penetrated the bus at least 10 feet back into the seating area. It came within a foot of a little girl sitting ahead of us. Luckily, no one was seriously hurt as the bus was half empty at the time.

The only other thing that I remember happening was when a senior from the high school, one of the few that ever rode the bus, thought it funny to pull the cord on my jacket after he apparently looped it around my neck tight. I immediately started choking and my vision went black until the next thing I remember the driver was dragging the kid off the bus by the arm and escorted him off where he left him standing. We quickly came to another immediate stop as the driver lept off the bus and went running back towards the kid (who fully matched the driver in height) and started yelling at him. The kid had thrown a rock at the bus as we started to leave and that college kid wasted no time dealing with him. 

Besides those two incidents, it was just endless hills and bumps and roller coaster drops as we'd run over rattlesnakes crossing the road or rabbits and dogs dodging the bus as we passed by endless farmland nestled into surrounding timber forests. This went on for 3 years until I started going into Baldwin my ninth grade year for high school and not long after I started riding with friends in their cars and pickups into school. One was named Allan who had his 46 ford pickup he was so proud of. A truck without a working starter so he'd always park so we could push it and get it started by popping the clutch to get the engine going.

We moved away after my sophomore year and to this day I miss that school at Vinland and the new high school in Baldwin that opened my freshman year. That was the first school I ever experienced air conditioning since we never had it at home and in school until then.

You should be getting around 80% BTU output at -20F, Kansas is not all that cold its going to be running very efficiency 99% of the time, I don't plan to keep any kind of backup heating I don't think it is needed. Looking at the temperature records here in Manhattan, there only has been 4 temperature records below -22F, -18F was in 2021 in that freeze the heat pump certainly would have been running less efficiently, but still working. Obviously we aren't the colder part of Kansas, but something to keep in mind. 

Most models that are cold climate heat are also very efficient AC units the Mr Cool unit has double the SEER rating of the one i currently use so there would be savings during the summer as well. The DOE has also been doing funding for more domestic cold weather heatpumps and trying to push their temperatures further, so by the time your replacing things in a few years they could be even better. 

The benefits extend beyond saving you money, if your furnace is your only gas appliance you can eliminate the risk of Carbon Monoxide in your home or an explosive gas leak. 

Not to say there won't be issues, you are going to have to deal with making sure snow does not bury it, but this can mean just getting it up more off the ground, it won't be free, you will see an increase in your electric bill. 


In an extremely poorly built home it might not have the raw BTUs to keep up that a large gas furnace can output, so you may want to improve that with air sealing in your attic, adding insulation that is ideally not fiberglass, upgrading windows ect. 



This is a pretty good video on heat pumps

Edit:

Someone is also going to argue that electricity won't be heating when the power is out, guess what neither will your furnace be blowing hot air when the electricity is out even if its gas due to electric ignition and blower that all run on electricity.

Edit Edit:

I am starting to suspect some people might have been told they were getting a cold climate model from their HVAC installer when they actually cheapened out and put in one not made for our climate and pocketed the money. That or HVAC installers are assuming a heat pump is a heat pump. 

There is videos of people in Canada using them, Norway uses a ton of them. What do you think is more likely these people don't have heating that works below 32F, OR maybe your HVAC installer fucked up and didn't get the correct models. 

If you do want to get a heat pump ask your installer for the spec sheet and what temperatures it is rated for, I wouldn't put in anything that does not work at least 80% performance at -5F and really think the ones like the Mr Cool, and Mitsubishi units that keep that into the -20F would perform in all conditions here in Kansas and those wouldn't even need aux heating.",2023-03-02 03:30:31+00:00

19,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, hate",Riding the school bus to Vinland Kansas in the '60's,"We moved from Baldwin Kansas sometime during 1965 to a very rural area a few miles outside Vinland and it was culture shock right away. We'd always lived in small towns, Olathe, Gardner (twice), and then Baldwin and while I wasn't a big fan of school I did like living in Baldwin. It had everything you needed. A theater, college kids going to Baker, and actual college dorms scattered around town. During that summer I played in little league (Cardinals) and actually had to try out in those days to make the team. But then my world took a hit when we moved to a small 1/2 acre cut into the hillside. I can still see that red dirt and taste that rusty well water.   

Then came school at Vinland junior high for the 6th grade (we had junior high for 6, 7, and 8 there). The school was ancient but they had added on a more modern building for grades 1-5 and that part still lives I believe while the old building is gone. And I don't believe it's a school anymore. As it turned out life was even better for a kid there as we had 13 kids in our class and everyone was friendly. But the downside was riding the bus 2 hours a day, an hour in the morning, and an hour at night mainly because we were first on in the morning and last off at night.

If you have ever ridden on a bus on country roads it's like riding a rollercoaster up and down the rolling hills of eastern Kansas complete with enough ruts, bumps, and drops to shake your brain loose. I spent most of my time trying to read science fiction books while dealing with motion sickness but in the end, my need to read got me past the sick stomach. That two hours a day was a life in itself as we wound our way through tree-covered narrow gravel country roads where we often clipped through overhanging branches if we had to make room for a passing car, tractor, or combine on its way to a field somewhere. 

And it wasn't a slow trip as those bus drivers (often college students) drove like the wind ""bullseye"". We got tossed all over, bounce up and down constantly the entire trip, and since there were no seat belts you could if you were careful end up in the aisle and on your backside often with the driver's face in his large mirror looking back at us with a grin on his face.

Sometimes the gravel dust would come in through the always-open windows and try to choke us all to death when vehicles passed by. The only break we go was when the bus stopped to drop or pick someone up. So you had to catch your breath quickly. The nightly trips were different as everyone was more relaxed and talkative. The girls often sang songs for most of that hour, Henry the 8th I Am was a favorite and most of us boys would groan as they started up yet another round of Henry over and over and ...well. Nevermind. You get the drift. My sister, who was 18 months younger, and her friend Cheryl often led the singing which I would try to ignore except to look up to catch a peek at her best friend sitting with her. Someone I had a crush on for 3 years and never once did I ever let on how I felt. (still hurts a bit sometimes).

The weather often made the trips even more treacherous with mud and snow and we seldom missed a day of school too. It usually took an ice storm to keep us home from school. We boys did have some fun usually towards the end of the run as the bus emptied out we'd sit in the furthest back seats and then slide into the aisle where we'd stand and ""surf"" the bus and its wilding changing angles over hills and bumps. Sometimes we'd catch the driver watching us but he usually didn't say anything when we did it. My friend Tim (Chanay) and I talked about joining the air force and becoming fighter pilots one day. His dad flew crop dusters out of the Vinland Aerodrome.

While it could get exciting moving over into the overhanging tree limbs at breakneck speed at times for the most part we were never really in any danger except one day, one very cold and icy day a broken limb off a tree (apparently had broke due to the ice on the three and was just sitting on top of other branches while it waited for us to pass buy. A pickup truck forced the driver over and with a crash, that limb came through the front windshield and penetrated the bus at least 10 feet back into the seating area. It came within a foot of a little girl sitting ahead of us. Luckily, no one was seriously hurt as the bus was half empty at the time.

The only other thing that I remember happening was when a senior from the high school, one of the few that ever rode the bus, thought it funny to pull the cord on my jacket after he apparently looped it around my neck tight. I immediately started choking and my vision went black until the next thing I remember the driver was dragging the kid off the bus by the arm and escorted him off where he left him standing. We quickly came to another immediate stop as the driver lept off the bus and went running back towards the kid (who fully matched the driver in height) and started yelling at him. The kid had thrown a rock at the bus as we started to leave and that college kid wasted no time dealing with him. 

Besides those two incidents, it was just endless hills and bumps and roller coaster drops as we'd run over rattlesnakes crossing the road or rabbits and dogs dodging the bus as we passed by endless farmland nestled into surrounding timber forests. This went on for 3 years until I started going into Baldwin my ninth grade year for high school and not long after I started riding with friends in their cars and pickups into school. One was named Allan who had his 46 ford pickup he was so proud of. A truck without a working starter so he'd always park so we could push it and get it started by popping the clutch to get the engine going.

We moved away after my sophomore year and to this day I miss that school at Vinland and the new high school in Baldwin that opened my freshman year. That was the first school I ever experienced air conditioning since we never had it at home and in school until then.

26,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

27,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00
28,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, enjoy",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00
29,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, enjoy",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00
30,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, enjoy",Kansas the Time to Ditch Gas and Switch to Heat Pumps Is Now,"There have been more posts and many people are talk just about how expensive gas heating has been getting here this year. If you are replacing your AC unit this summer or in the next few year I would highly suggest you look into getting a model that also functions as a heat pump(a cold climate one) installed, and just rip out your furnace. 

I ran the numbers for where I currently live and I estimated a heat pump is going to run about half of what last years heating cost in gas ran and that is with a high efficiency furnace. 

I plan in the next 5 years to remove all gas appliances from my home to save money. There is subsidies available to make it even more cheap. Heat pumps are cheaper then installing both an AC and Furnace, but will be more expensive then just an cheap AC unit, but given they can be more efficient then basic AC units at cooling so it can save money in the summer. 




I know what all the first responses are going to be 

>""Heat pumps don't work in the cold"" 

This is wrong, older older units loose performance in colder temperatures, but modern ones have no issues running well into the negatives here is someone having a Mitsubishi running just fine at -25F windchill.

Most models that are cold climate heat are also very efficient AC units the Mr Cool unit has double the SEER rating of the one i currently use so there would be savings during the summer as well. The DOE has also been doing funding for more domestic cold weather heatpumps and trying to push their temperatures further, so by the time your replacing things in a few years they could be even better. 

The benefits extend beyond saving you money, if your furnace is your only gas appliance you can eliminate the risk of Carbon Monoxide in your home or an explosive gas leak. 

Not to say there won't be issues, you are going to have to deal with making sure snow does not bury it, but this can mean just getting it up more off the ground, it won't be free, you will see an increase in your electric bill. 


In an extremely poorly built home it might not have the raw BTUs to keep up that a large gas furnace can output, so you may want to improve that with air sealing in your attic, adding insulation that is ideally not fiberglass, upgrading windows ect.

31,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, enjoy",Day 7-10 Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America)," 

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

35,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, enjoy",Riding the school bus to Vinland Kansas in the '60's,"We moved from Baldwin Kansas sometime during 1965 to a very rural area a few miles outside Vinland and it was culture shock right away. We'd always lived in small towns, Olathe, Gardner (twice), and then Baldwin and while I wasn't a big fan of school I did like living in Baldwin. It had everything you needed. A theater, college kids going to Baker, and actual college dorms scattered around town. During that summer I played in little league (Cardinals) and actually had to try out in those days to make the team. But then my world took a hit when we moved to a small 1/2 acre cut into the hillside. I can still see that red dirt and taste that rusty well water.   

Then came school at Vinland junior high for the 6th grade (we had junior high for 6, 7, and 8 there). The school was ancient but they had added on a more modern building for grades 1-5 and that part still lives I believe while the old building is gone. And I don't believe it's a school anymore. As it turned out life was even better for a kid there as we had 13 kids in our class and everyone was friendly. But the downside was riding the bus 2 hours a day, an hour in the morning, and an hour at night mainly because we were first on in the morning and last off at night.

If you have ever ridden on a bus on country roads it's like riding a rollercoaster up and down the rolling hills of eastern Kansas complete with enough ruts, bumps, and drops to shake your brain loose. I spent most of my time trying to read science fiction books while dealing with motion sickness but in the end, my need to read got me past the sick stomach. That two hours a day was a life in itself as we wound our way through tree-covered narrow gravel country roads where we often clipped through overhanging branches if we had to make room for a passing car, tractor, or combine on its way to a field somewhere. 

And it wasn't a slow trip as those bus drivers (often college students) drove like the wind ""bullseye"". We got tossed all over, bounce up and down constantly the entire trip, and since there were no seat belts you could if you were careful end up in the aisle and on your backside often with the driver's face in his large mirror looking back at us with a grin on his face.

Sometimes the gravel dust would come in through the always-open windows and try to choke us all to death when vehicles passed by. The only break we go was when the bus stopped to drop or pick someone up. So you had to catch your breath quickly. The nightly trips were different as everyone was more relaxed and talkative. The girls often sang songs for most of that hour, Henry the 8th I Am was a favorite and most of us boys would groan as they started up yet another round of Henry over and over and ...well. Nevermind. You get the drift. My sister, who was 18 months younger, and her friend Cheryl often led the singing which I would try to ignore except to look up to catch a peek at her best friend sitting with her. Someone I had a crush on for 3 years and never once did I ever let on how I felt. (still hurts a bit sometimes).

The weather often made the trips even more treacherous with mud and snow and we seldom missed a day of school too. It usually took an ice storm to keep us home from school. We boys did have some fun usually towards the end of the run as the bus emptied out we'd sit in the furthest back seats and then slide into the aisle where we'd stand and ""surf"" the bus and its wilding changing angles over hills and bumps. Sometimes we'd catch the driver watching us but he usually didn't say anything when we did it. My friend Tim (Chanay) and I talked about joining the air force and becoming fighter pilots one day. His dad flew crop dusters out of the Vinland Aerodrome.

While it could get exciting moving over into the overhanging tree limbs at breakneck speed at times for the most part we were never really in any danger except one day, one very cold and icy day a broken limb off a tree (apparently had broke due to the ice on the three and was just sitting on top of other branches while it waited for us to pass buy. A pickup truck forced the driver over and with a crash, that limb came through the front windshield and penetrated the bus at least 10 feet back into the seating area. It came within a foot of a little girl sitting ahead of us. Luckily, no one was seriously hurt as the bus was half empty at the time.

The only other thing that I remember happening was when a senior from the high school, one of the few that ever rode the bus, thought it funny to pull the cord on my jacket after he apparently looped it around my neck tight. I immediately started choking and my vision went black until the next thing I remember the driver was dragging the kid off the bus by the arm and escorted him off where he left him standing. We quickly came to another immediate stop as the driver lept off the bus and went running back towards the kid (who fully matched the driver in height) and started yelling at him. The kid had thrown a rock at the bus as we started to leave and that college kid wasted no time dealing with him. 

Besides those two incidents, it was just endless hills and bumps and roller coaster drops as we'd run over rattlesnakes crossing the road or rabbits and dogs dodging the bus as we passed by endless farmland nestled into surrounding timber forests. This went on for 3 years until I started going into Baldwin my ninth grade year for high school and not long after I started riding with friends in their cars and pickups into school. One was named Allan who had his 46 ford pickup he was so proud of. A truck without a working starter so he'd always park so we could push it and get it started by popping the clutch to get the engine going.

We moved away after my sophomore year and to this day I miss that school at Vinland and the new high school in Baldwin that opened my freshman year. That was the first school I ever experienced air conditioning since we never had it at home and in school until then.

43,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, dislike",Kansas the Time to Ditch Gas and Switch to Heat Pumps Is Now,"There have been more posts and many people are talk just about how expensive gas heating has been getting here this year. If you are replacing your AC unit this summer or in the next few year I would highly suggest you look into getting a model that also functions as a heat pump(a cold climate one) installed, and just rip out your furnace. 

I ran the numbers for where I currently live and I estimated a heat pump is going to run about half of what last years heating cost in gas ran and that is with a high efficiency furnace. 

I plan in the next 5 years to remove all gas appliances from my home to save money. There is subsidies available to make it even more cheap. Heat pumps are cheaper then installing both an AC and Furnace, but will be more expensive then just an cheap AC unit, but given they can be more efficient then basic AC units at cooling so it can save money in the summer. 




I know what all the first responses are going to be 

>""Heat pumps don't work in the cold"" 

This is wrong, older older units loose performance in colder temperatures, but modern ones have no issues running well into the negatives here is someone having a Mitsubishi running just fine at -25F windchill.

Mr Cool Universal Series which is what I plan to probably install myself as there is one downside most installers say they won't work with air source heatpumps. 

>""Unparalleled Heating: 100% at -5°F outside temp*

https://mrcool.com/mrcool-universal-series-dc-inverter-heat-pump-air-conditioner-split-system/

Mitsubishi is selling heatpumps in Canada that run at 90% at -13F. 

You should be getting around 80% BTU output at -20F, Kansas is not all that cold its going to be running very efficiency 99% of the time, I don't plan to keep any kind of backup heating I don't think it is needed. Looking at the temperature records here in Manhattan, there only has been 4 temperature records below -22F, -18F was in 2021 in that freeze the heat pump certainly would have been running less efficiently, but still working. Obviously we aren't the colder part of Kansas, but something to keep in mind. 

Most models that are cold climate heat are also very efficient AC units the Mr Cool unit has double the SEER rating of the one i currently use so there would be savings during the summer as well. The DOE has also been doing funding for more domestic cold weather heatpumps and trying to push their temperatures further, so by the time your replacing things in a few years they could be even better. 

The benefits extend beyond saving you money, if your furnace is your only gas appliance you can eliminate the risk of Carbon Monoxide in your home or an explosive gas leak. 

Not to say there won't be issues, you are going to have to deal with making sure snow does not bury it, but this can mean just getting it up more off the ground, it won't be free, you will see an increase in your electric bill. 


In an extremely poorly built home it might not have the raw BTUs to keep up that a large gas furnace can output, so you may want to improve that with air sealing in your attic, adding insulation that is ideally not fiberglass, upgrading windows ect. 



This is a pretty good video on heat pumps

Technology Connections:  Heat Pumps are Not Hard: Here's what it will take to start pumping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43XKfuptnik


Edit:

Someone is also going to argue that electricity won't be heating when the power is out, guess what neither will your furnace be blowing hot air when the electricity is out even if its gas due to electric ignition and blower that all run on electricity.

Edit Edit:

I am starting to suspect some people might have been told they were getting a cold climate model from their HVAC installer when they actually cheapened out and put in one not made for our climate and pocketed the money. That or HVAC installers are assuming a heat pump is a heat pump. 

There is videos of people in Canada using them, Norway uses a ton of them. What do you think is more likely these people don't have heating that works below 32F, OR maybe your HVAC installer fucked up and didn't get the correct models. 

If you do want to get a heat pump ask your installer for the spec sheet and what temperatures it is rated for, I wouldn't put in anything that does not work at least 80% performance at -5F and really think the ones like the Mr Cool, and Mitsubishi units that keep that into the -20F would perform in all conditions here in Kansas and those wouldn't even need aux heating.",2023-03-02 03:30:31+00:00

The benefits extend beyond saving you money, if your furnace is your only gas appliance you can eliminate the risk of Carbon Monoxide in your home or an explosive gas leak. 

Not to say there won't be issues, you are going to have to deal with making sure snow does not bury it, but this can mean just getting it up more off the ground, it won't be free, you will see an increase in your electric bill. 


In an extremely poorly built home it might not have the raw BTUs to keep up that a large gas furnace can output, so you may want to improve that with air sealing in your attic, adding insulation that is ideally not fiberglass, upgrading windows ect.

Someone is also going to argue that electricity won't be heating when the power is out, guess what neither will your furnace be blowing hot air when the electricity is out even if its gas due to electric ignition and blower that all run on electricity.

Edit Edit:

I am starting to suspect some people might have been told they were getting a cold climate model from their HVAC installer when they actually cheapened out and put in one not made for our climate and pocketed the money. That or HVAC installers are assuming a heat pump is a heat pump. 

There is videos of people in Canada using them, Norway uses a ton of them. What do you think is more likely these people don't have heating that works below 32F, OR maybe your HVAC installer fucked up and didn't get the correct models. 

If you do want to get a heat pump ask your installer for the spec sheet and what temperatures it is rated for, I wouldn't put in anything that does not work at least 80% performance at -5F and really think the ones like the Mr Cool, and Mitsubishi units that keep that into the -20F would perform in all conditions here in Kansas and those wouldn't even need aux heating.",2023-03-02 03:30:31+00:00

54,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, annoying",Riding the school bus to Vinland Kansas in the '60's,"We moved from Baldwin Kansas sometime during 1965 to a very rural area a few miles outside Vinland and it was culture shock right away. We'd always lived in small towns, Olathe, Gardner (twice), and then Baldwin and while I wasn't a big fan of school I did like living in Baldwin. It had everything you needed. A theater, college kids going to Baker, and actual college dorms scattered around town. During that summer I played in little league (Cardinals) and actually had to try out in those days to make the team. But then my world took a hit when we moved to a small 1/2 acre cut into the hillside. I can still see that red dirt and taste that rusty well water.   

Then came school at Vinland junior high for the 6th grade (we had junior high for 6, 7, and 8 there). The school was ancient but they had added on a more modern building for grades 1-5 and that part still lives I believe while the old building is gone. And I don't believe it's a school anymore. As it turned out life was even better for a kid there as we had 13 kids in our class and everyone was friendly. But the downside was riding the bus 2 hours a day, an hour in the morning, and an hour at night mainly because we were first on in the morning and last off at night.

If you have ever ridden on a bus on country roads it's like riding a rollercoaster up and down the rolling hills of eastern Kansas complete with enough ruts, bumps, and drops to shake your brain loose. I spent most of my time trying to read science fiction books while dealing with motion sickness but in the end, my need to read got me past the sick stomach. That two hours a day was a life in itself as we wound our way through tree-covered narrow gravel country roads where we often clipped through overhanging branches if we had to make room for a passing car, tractor, or combine on its way to a field somewhere. 

And it wasn't a slow trip as those bus drivers (often college students) drove like the wind ""bullseye"". We got tossed all over, bounce up and down constantly the entire trip, and since there were no seat belts you could if you were careful end up in the aisle and on your backside often with the driver's face in his large mirror looking back at us with a grin on his face.

Sometimes the gravel dust would come in through the always-open windows and try to choke us all to death when vehicles passed by. The only break we go was when the bus stopped to drop or pick someone up. So you had to catch your breath quickly. The nightly trips were different as everyone was more relaxed and talkative. The girls often sang songs for most of that hour, Henry the 8th I Am was a favorite and most of us boys would groan as they started up yet another round of Henry over and over and ...well. Nevermind. You get the drift. My sister, who was 18 months younger, and her friend Cheryl often led the singing which I would try to ignore except to look up to catch a peek at her best friend sitting with her. Someone I had a crush on for 3 years and never once did I ever let on how I felt. (still hurts a bit sometimes).

The weather often made the trips even more treacherous with mud and snow and we seldom missed a day of school too. It usually took an ice storm to keep us home from school. We boys did have some fun usually towards the end of the run as the bus emptied out we'd sit in the furthest back seats and then slide into the aisle where we'd stand and ""surf"" the bus and its wilding changing angles over hills and bumps. Sometimes we'd catch the driver watching us but he usually didn't say anything when we did it. My friend Tim (Chanay) and I talked about joining the air force and becoming fighter pilots one day. His dad flew crop dusters out of the Vinland Aerodrome.

While it could get exciting moving over into the overhanging tree limbs at breakneck speed at times for the most part we were never really in any danger except one day, one very cold and icy day a broken limb off a tree (apparently had broke due to the ice on the three and was just sitting on top of other branches while it waited for us to pass buy. A pickup truck forced the driver over and with a crash, that limb came through the front windshield and penetrated the bus at least 10 feet back into the seating area. It came within a foot of a little girl sitting ahead of us. Luckily, no one was seriously hurt as the bus was half empty at the time.

The only other thing that I remember happening was when a senior from the high school, one of the few that ever rode the bus, thought it funny to pull the cord on my jacket after he apparently looped it around my neck tight. I immediately started choking and my vision went black until the next thing I remember the driver was dragging the kid off the bus by the arm and escorted him off where he left him standing. We quickly came to another immediate stop as the driver lept off the bus and went running back towards the kid (who fully matched the driver in height) and started yelling at him. The kid had thrown a rock at the bus as we started to leave and that college kid wasted no time dealing with him. 

Besides those two incidents, it was just endless hills and bumps and roller coaster drops as we'd run over rattlesnakes crossing the road or rabbits and dogs dodging the bus as we passed by endless farmland nestled into surrounding timber forests. This went on for 3 years until I started going into Baldwin my ninth grade year for high school and not long after I started riding with friends in their cars and pickups into school. One was named Allan who had his 46 ford pickup he was so proud of. A truck without a working starter so he'd always park so we could push it and get it started by popping the clutch to get the engine going.

We moved away after my sophomore year and to this day I miss that school at Vinland and the new high school in Baldwin that opened my freshman year. That was the first school I ever experienced air conditioning since we never had it at home and in school until then.

61,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, happy",Kansas the Time to Ditch Gas and Switch to Heat Pumps Is Now,"There have been more posts and many people are talk just about how expensive gas heating has been getting here this year. If you are replacing your AC unit this summer or in the next few year I would highly suggest you look into getting a model that also functions as a heat pump(a cold climate one) installed, and just rip out your furnace. 

I ran the numbers for where I currently live and I estimated a heat pump is going to run about half of what last years heating cost in gas ran and that is with a high efficiency furnace. 

I plan in the next 5 years to remove all gas appliances from my home to save money. There is subsidies available to make it even more cheap. Heat pumps are cheaper then installing both an AC and Furnace, but will be more expensive then just an cheap AC unit, but given they can be more efficient then basic AC units at cooling so it can save money in the summer. 




I know what all the first responses are going to be 

>""Heat pumps don't work in the cold"" 

This is wrong, older older units loose performance in colder temperatures, but modern ones have no issues running well into the negatives here is someone having a Mitsubishi running just fine at -25F windchill.

Mr Cool Universal Series which is what I plan to probably install myself as there is one downside most installers say they won't work with air source heatpumps. 

>""Unparalleled Heating: 100% at -5°F outside temp*
78% Heating Capacity at -22°F outside temp*

https://mrcool.com/mrcool-universal-series-dc-inverter-heat-pump-air-conditioner-split-system/

Mitsubishi is selling heatpumps in Canada that run at 90% at -13F. 

You should be getting around 80% BTU output at -20F, Kansas is not all that cold its going to be running very efficiency 99% of the time, I don't plan to keep any kind of backup heating I don't think it is needed. Looking at the temperature records here in Manhattan, there only has been 4 temperature records below -22F, -18F was in 2021 in that freeze the heat pump certainly would have been running less efficiently, but still working. Obviously we aren't the colder part of Kansas, but something to keep in mind. 

Most models that are cold climate heat are also very efficient AC units the Mr Cool unit has double the SEER rating of the one i currently use so there would be savings during the summer as well.

A theater, college kids going to Baker, and actual college dorms scattered around town. During that summer I played in little league (Cardinals) and actually had to try out in those days to make the team. But then my world took a hit when we moved to a small 1/2 acre cut into the hillside. I can still see that red dirt and taste that rusty well water.   

Then came school at Vinland junior high for the 6th grade (we had junior high for 6, 7, and 8 there). The school was ancient but they had added on a more modern building for grades 1-5 and that part still lives I believe while the old building is gone. And I don't believe it's a school anymore. As it turned out life was even better for a kid there as we had 13 kids in our class and everyone was friendly. But the downside was riding the bus 2 hours a day, an hour in the morning, and an hour at night mainly because we were first on in the morning and last off at night.

If you have ever ridden on a bus on country roads it's like riding a rollercoaster up and down the rolling hills of eastern Kansas complete with enough ruts, bumps, and drops to shake your brain loose. I spent most of my time trying to read science fiction books while dealing with motion sickness but in the end, my need to read got me past the sick stomach. That two hours a day was a life in itself as we wound our way through tree-covered narrow gravel country roads where we often clipped through overhanging branches if we had to make room for a passing car, tractor, or combine on its way to a field somewhere. 

And it wasn't a slow trip as those bus drivers (often college students) drove like the wind ""bullseye"". We got tossed all over, bounce up and down constantly the entire trip, and since there were no seat belts you could if you were careful end up in the aisle and on your backside often with the driver's face in his large mirror looking back at us with a grin on his face.

Sometimes the gravel dust would come in through the always-open windows and try to choke us all to death when vehicles passed by. The only break we go was when the bus stopped to drop or pick someone up. So you had to catch your breath quickly. The nightly trips were different as everyone was more relaxed and talkative. The girls often sang songs for most of that hour, Henry the 8th I Am was a favorite and most of us boys would groan as they started up yet another round of Henry over and over and ...well. Nevermind. You get the drift. My sister, who was 18 months younger, and her friend Cheryl often led the singing which I would try to ignore except to look up to catch a peek at her best friend sitting with her. Someone I had a crush on for 3 years and never once did I ever let on how I felt. (still hurts a bit sometimes).

The weather often made the trips even more treacherous with mud and snow and we seldom missed a day of school too. It usually took an ice storm to keep us home from school. We boys did have some fun usually towards the end of the run as the bus emptied out we'd sit in the furthest back seats and then slide into the aisle where we'd stand and ""surf"" the bus and its wilding changing angles over hills and bumps. Sometimes we'd catch the driver watching us but he usually didn't say anything when we did it. My friend Tim (Chanay) and I talked about joining the air force and becoming fighter pilots one day. His dad flew crop dusters out of the Vinland Aerodrome.

While it could get exciting moving over into the overhanging tree limbs at breakneck speed at times for the most part we were never really in any danger except one day, one very cold and icy day a broken limb off a tree (apparently had broke due to the ice on the three and was just sitting on top of other branches while it waited for us to pass buy. A pickup truck forced the driver over and with a crash, that limb came through the front windshield and penetrated the bus at least 10 feet back into the seating area. It came within a foot of a little girl sitting ahead of us. Luckily, no one was seriously hurt as the bus was half empty at the time.

The only other thing that I remember happening was when a senior from the high school, one of the few that ever rode the bus, thought it funny to pull the cord on my jacket after he apparently looped it around my neck tight. I immediately started choking and my vision went black until the next thing I remember the driver was dragging the kid off the bus by the arm and escorted him off where he left him standing. We quickly came to another immediate stop as the driver lept off the bus and went running back towards the kid (who fully matched the driver in height) and started yelling at him. The kid had thrown a rock at the bus as we started to leave and that college kid wasted no time dealing with him. 

Besides those two incidents, it was just endless hills and bumps and roller coaster drops as we'd run over rattlesnakes crossing the road or rabbits and dogs dodging the bus as we passed by endless farmland nestled into surrounding timber forests. This went on for 3 years until I started going into Baldwin my ninth grade year for high school and not long after I started riding with friends in their cars and pickups into school. One was named Allan who had his 46 ford pickup he was so proud of. A truck without a working starter so he'd always park so we could push it and get it started by popping the clutch to get the engine going.

We moved away after my sophomore year and to this day I miss that school at Vinland and the new high school in Baldwin that opened my freshman year. That was the first school I ever experienced air conditioning since we never had it at home and in school until then.

81,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, comfortable",Kansas the Time to Ditch Gas and Switch to Heat Pumps Is Now,"There have been more posts and many people are talk just about how expensive gas heating has been getting here this year. If you are replacing your AC unit this summer or in the next few year I would highly suggest you look into getting a model that also functions as a heat pump(a cold climate one) installed, and just rip out your furnace. 

I ran the numbers for where I currently live and I estimated a heat pump is going to run about half of what last years heating cost in gas ran and that is with a high efficiency furnace. 

I plan in the next 5 years to remove all gas appliances from my home to save money. There is subsidies available to make it even more cheap. Heat pumps are cheaper then installing both an AC and Furnace, but will be more expensive then just an cheap AC unit, but given they can be more efficient then basic AC units at cooling so it can save money in the summer. 




I know what all the first responses are going to be 

>""Heat pumps don't work in the cold"" 

This is wrong, older older units loose performance in colder temperatures, but modern ones have no issues running well into the negatives here is someone having a Mitsubishi running just fine at -25F windchill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LPrSdN5P7M

Mr Cool Universal Series which is what I plan to probably install myself as there is one downside most installers say they won't work with air source heatpumps. 

>""Unparalleled Heating: 100% at -5°F outside temp*
78% Heating Capacity at -22°F outside temp*
Enhanced Cooling: 100% at 115°F outside temp*
78% Cooling Capacity at 130°F outside temp*""
https://mrcool.com/mrcool-universal-series-dc-inverter-heat-pump-air-conditioner-split-system/

Mitsubishi is selling heatpumps in Canada that run at 90% at -13F. 

You should be getting around 80% BTU output at -20F, Kansas is not all that cold its going to be running very efficiency 99% of the time, I don't plan to keep any kind of backup heating I don't think it is needed. Looking at the temperature records here in Manhattan, there only has been 4 temperature records below -22F, -18F was in 2021 in that freeze the heat pump certainly would have been running less efficiently, but still working. Obviously we aren't the colder part of Kansas, but something to keep in mind. 

Most models that are cold climate heat are also very efficient AC units the Mr Cool unit has double the SEER rating of the one i currently use so there would be savings during the summer as well. The DOE has also been doing funding for more domestic cold weather heatpumps and trying to push their temperatures further, so by the time your replacing things in a few years they could be even better. 

The benefits extend beyond saving you money, if your furnace is your only gas appliance you can eliminate the risk of Carbon Monoxide in your home or an explosive gas leak. 

Not to say there won't be issues, you are going to have to deal with making sure snow does not bury it, but this can mean just getting it up more off the ground, it won't be free, you will see an increase in your electric bill. 


In an extremely poorly built home it might not have the raw BTUs to keep up that a large gas furnace can output, so you may want to improve that with air sealing in your attic, adding insulation that is ideally not fiberglass, upgrading windows ect. 



This is a pretty good video on heat pumps

Technology Connections:  Heat Pumps are Not Hard: Here's what it will take to start pumping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43XKfuptnik


Edit:

Someone is also going to argue that electricity won't be heating when the power is out, guess what neither will your furnace be blowing hot air when the electricity is out even if its gas due to electric ignition and blower that all run on electricity.

Edit Edit:

I am starting to suspect some people might have been told they were getting a cold climate model from their HVAC installer when they actually cheapened out and put in one not made for our climate and pocketed the money. That or HVAC installers are assuming a heat pump is a heat pump. 

There is videos of people in Canada using them, Norway uses a ton of them. What do you think is more likely these people don't have heating that works below 32F, OR maybe your HVAC installer fucked up and didn't get the correct models. 

If you do want to get a heat pump ask your installer for the spec sheet and what temperatures it is rated for, I wouldn't put in anything that does not work at least 80% performance at -5F and really think the ones like the Mr Cool, and Mitsubishi units that keep that into the -20F would perform in all conditions here in Kansas and those wouldn't even need aux heating.",2023-03-02 03:30:31+00:00

87,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, love",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

91,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, love",Day 7-10 Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America)," 

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow.

92,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

93,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00
94,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, enjoy",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00
95,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, enjoy",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00
96,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, enjoy",Day 7-10 Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America)," 

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live.

No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem.

Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

106,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

107,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00
108,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, enjoy",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00
109,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, enjoy",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00
110,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, enjoy",Day 7-10 Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America)," 

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

120,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

121,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00
122,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, enjoy",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow.

123,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowstorm, enjoy",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

I'm a journalist for the Kansas News Service and KCUR (public radio). I'm looking for people to interview for a story on losing power during severe weather in July and January. I know some lost power for days in July after the massive wind storm knocked down trees. Did anyone who lost power then also lose power in January?

If anyone is willing to share their experiences with me for a radio news story, I would love to hear them. You can message me here or send me an email at [dlysen@kcur.org](mailto:dlysen@kcur.org).

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

135,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

136,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00
137,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, enjoy",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

138,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, blizzard, enjoy",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00

But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow.

145,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, love",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

149,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

150,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover.

152,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, flurries, enjoy",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00

My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

159,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, love",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

162,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, love",Day 7-10 Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America)," 

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers.

163,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, love",Riding the school bus to Vinland Kansas in the '60's,"We moved from Baldwin Kansas sometime during 1965 to a very rural area a few miles outside Vinland and it was culture shock right away. We'd always lived in small towns, Olathe, Gardner (twice), and then Baldwin and while I wasn't a big fan of school I did like living in Baldwin. It had everything you needed. A theater, college kids going to Baker, and actual college dorms scattered around town. During that summer I played in little league (Cardinals) and actually had to try out in those days to make the team. But then my world took a hit when we moved to a small 1/2 acre cut into the hillside. I can still see that red dirt and taste that rusty well water.   

Then came school at Vinland junior high for the 6th grade (we had junior high for 6, 7, and 8 there). The school was ancient but they had added on a more modern building for grades 1-5 and that part still lives I believe while the old building is gone. And I don't believe it's a school anymore. As it turned out life was even better for a kid there as we had 13 kids in our class and everyone was friendly. But the downside was riding the bus 2 hours a day, an hour in the morning, and an hour at night mainly because we were first on in the morning and last off at night.

If you have ever ridden on a bus on country roads it's like riding a rollercoaster up and down the rolling hills of eastern Kansas complete with enough ruts, bumps, and drops to shake your brain loose. I spent most of my time trying to read science fiction books while dealing with motion sickness but in the end, my need to read got me past the sick stomach. That two hours a day was a life in itself as we wound our way through tree-covered narrow gravel country roads where we often clipped through overhanging branches if we had to make room for a passing car, tractor, or combine on its way to a field somewhere. 

And it wasn't a slow trip as those bus drivers (often college students) drove like the wind ""bullseye"". We got tossed all over, bounce up and down constantly the entire trip, and since there were no seat belts you could if you were careful end up in the aisle and on your backside often with the driver's face in his large mirror looking back at us with a grin on his face.

Sometimes the gravel dust would come in through the always-open windows and try to choke us all to death when vehicles passed by. The only break we go was when the bus stopped to drop or pick someone up. So you had to catch your breath quickly. The nightly trips were different as everyone was more relaxed and talkative. The girls often sang songs for most of that hour, Henry the 8th I Am was a favorite and most of us boys would groan as they started up yet another round of Henry over and over and ...well. Nevermind. You get the drift. My sister, who was 18 months younger, and her friend Cheryl often led the singing which I would try to ignore except to look up to catch a peek at her best friend sitting with her. Someone I had a crush on for 3 years and never once did I ever let on how I felt. (still hurts a bit sometimes).

The weather often made the trips even more treacherous with mud and snow and we seldom missed a day of school too. It usually took an ice storm to keep us home from school. We boys did have some fun usually towards the end of the run as the bus emptied out we'd sit in the furthest back seats and then slide into the aisle where we'd stand and ""surf"" the bus and its wilding changing angles over hills and bumps. Sometimes we'd catch the driver watching us but he usually didn't say anything when we did it. My friend Tim (Chanay) and I talked about joining the air force and becoming fighter pilots one day. His dad flew crop dusters out of the Vinland Aerodrome.

While it could get exciting moving over into the overhanging tree limbs at breakneck speed at times for the most part we were never really in any danger except one day, one very cold and icy day a broken limb off a tree (apparently had broke due to the ice on the three and was just sitting on top of other branches while it waited for us to pass buy. A pickup truck forced the driver over and with a crash, that limb came through the front windshield and penetrated the bus at least 10 feet back into the seating area. It came within a foot of a little girl sitting ahead of us. Luckily, no one was seriously hurt as the bus was half empty at the time.

The only other thing that I remember happening was when a senior from the high school, one of the few that ever rode the bus, thought it funny to pull the cord on my jacket after he apparently looped it around my neck tight. I immediately started choking and my vision went black until the next thing I remember the driver was dragging the kid off the bus by the arm and escorted him off where he left him standing. We quickly came to another immediate stop as the driver lept off the bus and went running back towards the kid (who fully matched the driver in height) and started yelling at him. The kid had thrown a rock at the bus as we started to leave and that college kid wasted no time dealing with him. 

Besides those two incidents, it was just endless hills and bumps and roller coaster drops as we'd run over rattlesnakes crossing the road or rabbits and dogs dodging the bus as we passed by endless farmland nestled into surrounding timber forests. This went on for 3 years until I started going into Baldwin my ninth grade year for high school and not long after I started riding with friends in their cars and pickups into school. One was named Allan who had his 46 ford pickup he was so proud of. A truck without a working starter so he'd always park so we could push it and get it started by popping the clutch to get the engine going.

We moved away after my sophomore year and to this day I miss that school at Vinland and the new high school in Baldwin that opened my freshman year. That was the first school I ever experienced air conditioning since we never had it at home and in school until then.

A truck without a working starter so he'd always park so we could push it and get it started by popping the clutch to get the engine going.

We moved away after my sophomore year and to this day I miss that school at Vinland and the new high school in Baldwin that opened my freshman year. That was the first school I ever experienced air conditioning since we never had it at home and in school until then.

165,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

166,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00
167,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, enjoy",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00
168,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, enjoy",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00
169,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, enjoy",Day 7-10 Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America)," 

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

172,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, enjoy",Riding the school bus to Vinland Kansas in the '60's,"We moved from Baldwin Kansas sometime during 1965 to a very rural area a few miles outside Vinland and it was culture shock right away. We'd always lived in small towns, Olathe, Gardner (twice), and then Baldwin and while I wasn't a big fan of school I did like living in Baldwin. It had everything you needed. A theater, college kids going to Baker, and actual college dorms scattered around town. During that summer I played in little league (Cardinals) and actually had to try out in those days to make the team. But then my world took a hit when we moved to a small 1/2 acre cut into the hillside. I can still see that red dirt and taste that rusty well water.   

Then came school at Vinland junior high for the 6th grade (we had junior high for 6, 7, and 8 there). The school was ancient but they had added on a more modern building for grades 1-5 and that part still lives I believe while the old building is gone. And I don't believe it's a school anymore. As it turned out life was even better for a kid there as we had 13 kids in our class and everyone was friendly. But the downside was riding the bus 2 hours a day, an hour in the morning, and an hour at night mainly because we were first on in the morning and last off at night.

If you have ever ridden on a bus on country roads it's like riding a rollercoaster up and down the rolling hills of eastern Kansas complete with enough ruts, bumps, and drops to shake your brain loose. I spent most of my time trying to read science fiction books while dealing with motion sickness but in the end, my need to read got me past the sick stomach. That two hours a day was a life in itself as we wound our way through tree-covered narrow gravel country roads where we often clipped through overhanging branches if we had to make room for a passing car, tractor, or combine on its way to a field somewhere. 

And it wasn't a slow trip as those bus drivers (often college students) drove like the wind ""bullseye"". We got tossed all over, bounce up and down constantly the entire trip, and since there were no seat belts you could if you were careful end up in the aisle and on your backside often with the driver's face in his large mirror looking back at us with a grin on his face.

Sometimes the gravel dust would come in through the always-open windows and try to choke us all to death when vehicles passed by. The only break we go was when the bus stopped to drop or pick someone up. So you had to catch your breath quickly. The nightly trips were different as everyone was more relaxed and talkative. The girls often sang songs for most of that hour, Henry the 8th I Am was a favorite and most of us boys would groan as they started up yet another round of Henry over and over and ...well. Nevermind. You get the drift. My sister, who was 18 months younger, and her friend Cheryl often led the singing which I would try to ignore except to look up to catch a peek at her best friend sitting with her. Someone I had a crush on for 3 years and never once did I ever let on how I felt. (still hurts a bit sometimes).

The weather often made the trips even more treacherous with mud and snow and we seldom missed a day of school too. It usually took an ice storm to keep us home from school. We boys did have some fun usually towards the end of the run as the bus emptied out we'd sit in the furthest back seats and then slide into the aisle where we'd stand and ""surf"" the bus and its wilding changing angles over hills and bumps. Sometimes we'd catch the driver watching us but he usually didn't say anything when we did it. My friend Tim (Chanay) and I talked about joining the air force and becoming fighter pilots one day. His dad flew crop dusters out of the Vinland Aerodrome.

While it could get exciting moving over into the overhanging tree limbs at breakneck speed at times for the most part we were never really in any danger except one day, one very cold and icy day a broken limb off a tree (apparently had broke due to the ice on the three and was just sitting on top of other branches while it waited for us to pass buy. A pickup truck forced the driver over and with a crash, that limb came through the front windshield and penetrated the bus at least 10 feet back into the seating area. It came within a foot of a little girl sitting ahead of us. Luckily, no one was seriously hurt as the bus was half empty at the time.

The only other thing that I remember happening was when a senior from the high school, one of the few that ever rode the bus, thought it funny to pull the cord on my jacket after he apparently looped it around my neck tight. I immediately started choking and my vision went black until the next thing I remember the driver was dragging the kid off the bus by the arm and escorted him off where he left him standing. We quickly came to another immediate stop as the driver lept off the bus and went running back towards the kid (who fully matched the driver in height) and started yelling at him. The kid had thrown a rock at the bus as we started to leave and that college kid wasted no time dealing with him. 

Besides those two incidents, it was just endless hills and bumps and roller coaster drops as we'd run over rattlesnakes crossing the road or rabbits and dogs dodging the bus as we passed by endless farmland nestled into surrounding timber forests. This went on for 3 years until I started going into Baldwin my ninth grade year for high school and not long after I started riding with friends in their cars and pickups into school. One was named Allan who had his 46 ford pickup he was so proud of. A truck without a working starter so he'd always park so we could push it and get it started by popping the clutch to get the engine going.

We moved away after my sophomore year and to this day I miss that school at Vinland and the new high school in Baldwin that opened my freshman year. That was the first school I ever experienced air conditioning since we never had it at home and in school until then.

Besides those two incidents, it was just endless hills and bumps and roller coaster drops as we'd run over rattlesnakes crossing the road or rabbits and dogs dodging the bus as we passed by endless farmland nestled into surrounding timber forests. This went on for 3 years until I started going into Baldwin my ninth grade year for high school and not long after I started riding with friends in their cars and pickups into school. One was named Allan who had his 46 ford pickup he was so proud of. A truck without a working starter so he'd always park so we could push it and get it started by popping the clutch to get the engine going.

We moved away after my sophomore year and to this day I miss that school at Vinland and the new high school in Baldwin that opened my freshman year. That was the first school I ever experienced air conditioning since we never had it at home and in school until then.

175,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, icy, annoying",Riding the school bus to Vinland Kansas in the '60's,"We moved from Baldwin Kansas sometime during 1965 to a very rural area a few miles outside Vinland and it was culture shock right away. We'd always lived in small towns, Olathe, Gardner (twice), and then Baldwin and while I wasn't a big fan of school I did like living in Baldwin. It had everything you needed. A theater, college kids going to Baker, and actual college dorms scattered around town. During that summer I played in little league (Cardinals) and actually had to try out in those days to make the team. But then my world took a hit when we moved to a small 1/2 acre cut into the hillside. I can still see that red dirt and taste that rusty well water.   

Then came school at Vinland junior high for the 6th grade (we had junior high for 6, 7, and 8 there). The school was ancient but they had added on a more modern building for grades 1-5 and that part still lives I believe while the old building is gone. And I don't believe it's a school anymore. As it turned out life was even better for a kid there as we had 13 kids in our class and everyone was friendly. But the downside was riding the bus 2 hours a day, an hour in the morning, and an hour at night mainly because we were first on in the morning and last off at night.

If you have ever ridden on a bus on country roads it's like riding a rollercoaster up and down the rolling hills of eastern Kansas complete with enough ruts, bumps, and drops to shake your brain loose. I spent most of my time trying to read science fiction books while dealing with motion sickness but in the end, my need to read got me past the sick stomach. That two hours a day was a life in itself as we wound our way through tree-covered narrow gravel country roads where we often clipped through overhanging branches if we had to make room for a passing car, tractor, or combine on its way to a field somewhere. 

And it wasn't a slow trip as those bus drivers (often college students) drove like the wind ""bullseye"". We got tossed all over, bounce up and down constantly the entire trip, and since there were no seat belts you could if you were careful end up in the aisle and on your backside often with the driver's face in his large mirror looking back at us with a grin on his face.

Sometimes the gravel dust would come in through the always-open windows and try to choke us all to death when vehicles passed by. The only break we go was when the bus stopped to drop or pick someone up. So you had to catch your breath quickly. The nightly trips were different as everyone was more relaxed and talkative. The girls often sang songs for most of that hour, Henry the 8th I Am was a favorite and most of us boys would groan as they started up yet another round of Henry over and over and ...well. Nevermind. You get the drift. My sister, who was 18 months younger, and her friend Cheryl often led the singing which I would try to ignore except to look up to catch a peek at her best friend sitting with her. Someone I had a crush on for 3 years and never once did I ever let on how I felt. (still hurts a bit sometimes).

The weather often made the trips even more treacherous with mud and snow and we seldom missed a day of school too. It usually took an ice storm to keep us home from school. We boys did have some fun usually towards the end of the run as the bus emptied out we'd sit in the furthest back seats and then slide into the aisle where we'd stand and ""surf"" the bus and its wilding changing angles over hills and bumps. Sometimes we'd catch the driver watching us but he usually didn't say anything when we did it. My friend Tim (Chanay) and I talked about joining the air force and becoming fighter pilots one day. His dad flew crop dusters out of the Vinland Aerodrome.

While it could get exciting moving over into the overhanging tree limbs at breakneck speed at times for the most part we were never really in any danger except one day, one very cold and icy day a broken limb off a tree (apparently had broke due to the ice on the three and was just sitting on top of other branches while it waited for us to pass buy. A pickup truck forced the driver over and with a crash, that limb came through the front windshield and penetrated the bus at least 10 feet back into the seating area. It came within a foot of a little girl sitting ahead of us. Luckily, no one was seriously hurt as the bus was half empty at the time.

The only other thing that I remember happening was when a senior from the high school, one of the few that ever rode the bus, thought it funny to pull the cord on my jacket after he apparently looped it around my neck tight. I immediately started choking and my vision went black until the next thing I remember the driver was dragging the kid off the bus by the arm and escorted him off where he left him standing. We quickly came to another immediate stop as the driver lept off the bus and went running back towards the kid (who fully matched the driver in height) and started yelling at him.

181,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, love",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

185,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

186,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00
187,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, enjoy",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00
188,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, frosty, enjoy",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00

196,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, love",Kansas the Time to Ditch Gas and Switch to Heat Pumps Is Now,"There have been more posts and many people are talk just about how expensive gas heating has been getting here this year. If you are replacing your AC unit this summer or in the next few year I would highly suggest you look into getting a model that also functions as a heat pump(a cold climate one) installed, and just rip out your furnace. 

I ran the numbers for where I currently live and I estimated a heat pump is going to run about half of what last years heating cost in gas ran and that is with a high efficiency furnace. 

I plan in the next 5 years to remove all gas appliances from my home to save money. There is subsidies available to make it even more cheap. Heat pumps are cheaper then installing both an AC and Furnace, but will be more expensive then just an cheap AC unit, but given they can be more efficient then basic AC units at cooling so it can save money in the summer. 




I know what all the first responses are going to be 

>""Heat pumps don't work in the cold"" 

This is wrong, older older units loose performance in colder temperatures, but modern ones have no issues running well into the negatives here is someone having a Mitsubishi running just fine at -25F windchill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LPrSdN5P7M

Mr Cool Universal Series which is what I plan to probably install myself as there is one downside most installers say they won't work with air source heatpumps. 

>""Unparalleled Heating: 100% at -5°F outside temp*
78% Heating Capacity at -22°F outside temp*
Enhanced Cooling: 100% at 115°F outside temp*
78% Cooling Capacity at 130°F outside temp*""
https://mrcool.com/mrcool-universal-series-dc-inverter-heat-pump-air-conditioner-split-system/

Mitsubishi is selling heatpumps in Canada that run at 90% at -13F. 

You should be getting around 80% BTU output at -20F, Kansas is not all that cold its going to be running very efficiency 99% of the time, I don't plan to keep any kind of backup heating I don't think it is needed. Looking at the temperature records here in Manhattan, there only has been 4 temperature records below -22F, -18F was in 2021 in that freeze the heat pump certainly would have been running less efficiently, but still working. Obviously we aren't the colder part of Kansas, but something to keep in mind. 

Most models that are cold climate heat are also very efficient AC units the Mr Cool unit has double the SEER rating of the one i currently use so there would be savings during the summer as well. The DOE has also been doing funding for more domestic cold weather heatpumps and trying to push their temperatures further, so by the time your replacing things in a few years they could be even better. 

The benefits extend beyond saving you money, if your furnace is your only gas appliance you can eliminate the risk of Carbon Monoxide in your home or an explosive gas leak. 

Not to say there won't be issues, you are going to have to deal with making sure snow does not bury it, but this can mean just getting it up more off the ground, it won't be free, you will see an increase in your electric bill. 


In an extremely poorly built home it might not have the raw BTUs to keep up that a large gas furnace can output, so you may want to improve that with air sealing in your attic, adding insulation that is ideally not fiberglass, upgrading windows ect.

I am starting to suspect some people might have been told they were getting a cold climate model from their HVAC installer when they actually cheapened out and put in one not made for our climate and pocketed the money. That or HVAC installers are assuming a heat pump is a heat pump. 

There is videos of people in Canada using them, Norway uses a ton of them. What do you think is more likely these people don't have heating that works below 32F, OR maybe your HVAC installer fucked up and didn't get the correct models. 

If you do want to get a heat pump ask your installer for the spec sheet and what temperatures it is rated for, I wouldn't put in anything that does not work at least 80% performance at -5F and really think the ones like the Mr Cool, and Mitsubishi units that keep that into the -20F would perform in all conditions here in Kansas and those wouldn't even need aux heating.",2023-03-02 03:30:31+00:00

Mitsubishi is selling heatpumps in Canada that run at 90% at -13F. 

You should be getting around 80% BTU output at -20F, Kansas is not all that cold its going to be running very efficiency 99% of the time, I don't plan to keep any kind of backup heating I don't think it is needed. Looking at the temperature records here in Manhattan, there only has been 4 temperature records below -22F, -18F was in 2021 in that freeze the heat pump certainly would have been running less efficiently, but still working. Obviously we aren't the colder part of Kansas, but something to keep in mind. 

Most models that are cold climate heat are also very efficient AC units the Mr Cool unit has double the SEER rating of the one i currently use so there would be savings during the summer as well. The DOE has also been doing funding for more domestic cold weather heatpumps and trying to push their temperatures further, so by the time your replacing things in a few years they could be even better.

I ran the numbers for where I currently live and I estimated a heat pump is going to run about half of what last years heating cost in gas ran and that is with a high efficiency furnace. 

I plan in the next 5 years to remove all gas appliances from my home to save money. There is subsidies available to make it even more cheap. Heat pumps are cheaper then installing both an AC and Furnace, but will be more expensive then just an cheap AC unit, but given they can be more efficient then basic AC units at cooling so it can save money in the summer.

Mitsubishi is selling heatpumps in Canada that run at 90% at -13F. 

You should be getting around 80% BTU output at -20F, Kansas is not all that cold its going to be running very efficiency 99% of the time, I don't plan to keep any kind of backup heating I don't think it is needed. Looking at the temperature records here in Manhattan, there only has been 4 temperature records below -22F, -18F was in 2021 in that freeze the heat pump certainly would have been running less efficiently, but still working. Obviously we aren't the colder part of Kansas, but something to keep in mind. 

Most models that are cold climate heat are also very efficient AC units the Mr Cool unit has double the SEER rating of the one i currently use so there would be savings during the summer as well. The DOE has also been doing funding for more domestic cold weather heatpumps and trying to push their temperatures further, so by the time your replacing things in a few years they could be even better. 

The benefits extend beyond saving you money, if your furnace is your only gas appliance you can eliminate the risk of Carbon Monoxide in your home or an explosive gas leak. 

Not to say there won't be issues, you are going to have to deal with making sure snow does not bury it, but this can mean just getting it up more off the ground, it won't be free, you will see an increase in your electric bill. 


In an extremely poorly built home it might not have the raw BTUs to keep up that a large gas furnace can output, so you may want to improve that with air sealing in your attic, adding insulation that is ideally not fiberglass, upgrading windows ect.

Someone is also going to argue that electricity won't be heating when the power is out, guess what neither will your furnace be blowing hot air when the electricity is out even if its gas due to electric ignition and blower that all run on electricity.

I am starting to suspect some people might have been told they were getting a cold climate model from their HVAC installer when they actually cheapened out and put in one not made for our climate and pocketed the money. That or HVAC installers are assuming a heat pump is a heat pump. 

There is videos of people in Canada using them, Norway uses a ton of them. What do you think is more likely these people don't have heating that works below 32F, OR maybe your HVAC installer fucked up and didn't get the correct models. 

If you do want to get a heat pump ask your installer for the spec sheet and what temperatures it is rated for, I wouldn't put in anything that does not work at least 80% performance at -5F and really think the ones like the Mr Cool, and Mitsubishi units that keep that into the -20F would perform in all conditions here in Kansas and those wouldn't even need aux heating.",2023-03-02 03:30:31+00:00

279,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",Looking to move to Kentucky. Would love some real life info on some places.,"So to make a very long story short (will try to be organized) in the next couple years my mother and I and possibly my brother are looking at selling both our houses in upstate NY (god I hate it here) and moving to Kentucky.

We have looked into a lot of info to pick a state and are pretty set on Kentucky for a number of reasons. That being said we have never moved out of state or looked and it's a bit hard online to sort the reality & truth from the bs and pomp.

I will try to highlight some keypoints of what we are looking for but would appreciate ANY help in narrowing down good cities to look into or just as importantly good cities to AVOID.

&#x200B;

* We are looking for suburbs. This is pretty important. We like our own space and while we don't want full blown country with the nearest hospital or store being an hour away we would like to avoid a street with house after house on top of each other.  Suburbs with a 10-20 minute city away would be great. Would like businesses/stores/doctors/fast food places/jobs etc within a realistic distance away.
* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state. We enjoy all 4 seasons but living currently near buffalo we are so done with snow storms that give us literally feet of lake effect snow. On the flip side not a huge fan of super hot and humid. I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine. We are NOT looking for a fixer upper or a ""dump"" that needs a ton of work. Probably something  like 2-3 bedrooms 2-3 bathrooms. Does not need to have a huge yard or a ton of land (actually don't want a  TON of land).
* Amenities and attractions and such don't matter very much. We both spend the majority of our time in house or in yard and don't ever really go out much besides for normal shopping and such. Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

Anyway thought I would ask reddit because it's such good source of factual info. Any help would be appreciated. Probably won't be moving for 2-3 years but would like to start narrowing things down and at least finding a good area to look in.  Any help from anyone out there who has a nice area or has visited a nice area or any info at all would be awesome.

Thanks in advance!!

We make around $160k combined per year currently, and would like to steer clear from areas known for drugs or crime as we hope to start a family. We like a country, slower paced, less populated way of life but still like to go out to eat and meet at coffee shops with friends, etc. every now and again and don’t mind driving 30ish minutes to do so. We are mostly homebodies, love walking/hiking, country drives, kayaking, ATVs, we are interested in horses, keeping livestock animals, and love our dogs. 
 
Why we’re attracted to Kentucky:
1.     Affordability
2.     Land with seemingly decent looking/sized houses with shops and barns (you have to pay around $1m for that in our current area)
3.     In the Bluegrass region, properties seem close-ish to the two main cities for entertainment, connections, etc. 
4.     4 seasons
5.     Even just a tiny bit of snow? We get get zero now, so any at all would be neat
6.     People are nice? We read it’s a highly rated area for “nice” folks. Oregon, not so much...
7.     Horses
8.     Near lots of different states and areas; the midwest, the south, the east coast 
 
Things we’re worried about:
1.     Humid summers; our summers are 0%
2.     Tornadoes! More insight/info on living alongside these would be so helpful
3.     Snakes; only ever see the occasional garden snake here now
 
If anyone has opinions on if Kentucky seems like a good fit for us and has any additional info, education, or insights into anything regarding Kentucky, but also about our concern points, that would be so helpful! Thank you!",2024-01-11 02:49:16+00:00

286,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snow, love",Where should we live?," 

My partner and I are moving from Denver, CO as soon as I finish grad school and are looking for our next home. Here's a little bit about us and what we're ideally looking for (edit: I realize this is idealistic, and we're ready to make some compromises as needed):

\-I'll be working as a therapist & would love to have good opportunities for jobs with decent pay. I'm finishing a very long grad program in May!

\-My partner has recently started working as a paralegal

\-we're both pretty left-leaning politically and would like to have at least a small community of like-minded people wherever we live. Big on mutual aid. We don't need to be in a totally blue area, but also don't want to get run out of town for believing in climate change.

\-somewhere with some art, music, culture, cool stuff, maybe a little grungy

\-looking for somewhere green! We want to have a garden with a somewhat decent and would love access to other produce. This is a BIG DEAL to me. I grew up in AZ and they are steadily running out of water. I want to live somewhere where this isn't a major concern.

\-ideally somewhere that doesn't get TOO cold or TOO snowy, but we're coming from Denver, so we can handle some. This means I want to avoid a place where it rarely gets above 20 in the winter or it heavy snow stays all winter long. Were used to temps 20-50 all winter and snow of 1/8in-2 feet several times a month. My friends' stories about the midwest changed my perception of what cold actually means.

\-also somewhere that isn't wildly hot. I lived in Phoenix for awhile, and that was too hot. Denver gets into the 100s sometimes and it's not fun, but manageable.

\-sunshine - I don't need anywhere as sunny as Denver, but I'd love to see the sun at least a few times a month in the winter.

\-accessible hiking/biking/camping. The southwest has an excess of free public lands that we've gotten used to.

\-affordable! We're hoping to buy a house for under $400k with a decent yard. If we could get acreage in that price, that would be incredible.

\-safety/low crime is important to us at this point. We'll be starting a family in the next five years, so also decent schools.

\-ideally, we'd like to live in a smaller town (under 100k people) and could be very small (under 5k), if it's within 30 min of a bigger town/city where we could access all the necessities. Would love to be able to walk to some basics, but still have space.

Clarification:

I grew up in a town of 50k people and that was WAY big enough to live in without any other city nearby. My partner grew up in a town of 1500 with some real basics. There was a bigger city (200k) within 30 minutes. Both of these are great.

My dad lives in rural florida (not even in a town) and it's 20 minutes to the closest business (a gas station), and another 15 to the closest town of like 2,000 people. For them to buy most necessities, they have to drive an hour to Wal-mart. I'm not interested in that level of rural.",2023-01-15 17:40:12+00:00

Would love some real life info on some places.,"So to make a very long story short (will try to be organized) in the next couple years my mother and I and possibly my brother are looking at selling both our houses in upstate NY (god I hate it here) and moving to Kentucky.

We have looked into a lot of info to pick a state and are pretty set on Kentucky for a number of reasons. That being said we have never moved out of state or looked and it's a bit hard online to sort the reality & truth from the bs and pomp.

I will try to highlight some keypoints of what we are looking for but would appreciate ANY help in narrowing down good cities to look into or just as importantly good cities to AVOID.

&#x200B;

* We are looking for suburbs. This is pretty important. We like our own space and while we don't want full blown country with the nearest hospital or store being an hour away we would like to avoid a street with house after house on top of each other.  Suburbs with a 10-20 minute city away would be great. Would like businesses/stores/doctors/fast food places/jobs etc within a realistic distance away.
* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state. We enjoy all 4 seasons but living currently near buffalo we are so done with snow storms that give us literally feet of lake effect snow. On the flip side not a huge fan of super hot and humid. I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine. We are NOT looking for a fixer upper or a ""dump"" that needs a ton of work. Probably something  like 2-3 bedrooms 2-3 bathrooms. Does not need to have a huge yard or a ton of land (actually don't want a  TON of land).
* Amenities and attractions and such don't matter very much. We both spend the majority of our time in house or in yard and don't ever really go out much besides for normal shopping and such. Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

Anyway thought I would ask reddit because it's such good source of factual info. Any help would be appreciated. Probably won't be moving for 2-3 years but would like to start narrowing things down and at least finding a good area to look in.  Any help from anyone out there who has a nice area or has visited a nice area or any info at all would be awesome.

Thanks in advance!!

Probably won't be moving for 2-3 years but would like to start narrowing things down and at least finding a good area to look in.  Any help from anyone out there who has a nice area or has visited a nice area or any info at all would be awesome.

Happy Thursday, everyone!  All eyes are on our severe storm threat over the next three days as rounds of showers and storms look to ride along the edge of a building ridge.  This morning a complex of strong to severe storms is pushing across parts of western Kentucky.  Damaging winds have been the main threat thus far.

Later this evening, another round of storms looks to roll across the state.  The location of this round is still in question.  The latest hi-res models are showing this cluster all over the place.  The newest HRRR run shows this impacting more of central and eastern Kentucky but weakening as it pushes into the state. This is definitely something to watch for most of the region.  

More rounds of strong to severe storms look possible Friday and Saturday, and the focus of these rounds should shift to the northeast of our round so far today.  Each MCS's timings, location, and severity are still in question.  Uncertainty is high because of the difficulty of forecasting these Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS's) riding along the edge of a ridge.

Would love some real life info on some places.,"So to make a very long story short (will try to be organized) in the next couple years my mother and I and possibly my brother are looking at selling both our houses in upstate NY (god I hate it here) and moving to Kentucky.

We have looked into a lot of info to pick a state and are pretty set on Kentucky for a number of reasons. That being said we have never moved out of state or looked and it's a bit hard online to sort the reality & truth from the bs and pomp.

I will try to highlight some keypoints of what we are looking for but would appreciate ANY help in narrowing down good cities to look into or just as importantly good cities to AVOID.

&#x200B;

* We are looking for suburbs. This is pretty important. We like our own space and while we don't want full blown country with the nearest hospital or store being an hour away we would like to avoid a street with house after house on top of each other.  Suburbs with a 10-20 minute city away would be great. Would like businesses/stores/doctors/fast food places/jobs etc within a realistic distance away.
* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state. We enjoy all 4 seasons but living currently near buffalo we are so done with snow storms that give us literally feet of lake effect snow. On the flip side not a huge fan of super hot and humid. I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine. We are NOT looking for a fixer upper or a ""dump"" that needs a ton of work. Probably something  like 2-3 bedrooms 2-3 bathrooms. Does not need to have a huge yard or a ton of land (actually don't want a  TON of land).
* Amenities and attractions and such don't matter very much. We both spend the majority of our time in house or in yard and don't ever really go out much besides for normal shopping and such. Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

335,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowy, love",Where should we live?," 

My partner and I are moving from Denver, CO as soon as I finish grad school and are looking for our next home. Here's a little bit about us and what we're ideally looking for (edit: I realize this is idealistic, and we're ready to make some compromises as needed):

\-I'll be working as a therapist & would love to have good opportunities for jobs with decent pay. I'm finishing a very long grad program in May!

\-My partner has recently started working as a paralegal

\-we're both pretty left-leaning politically and would like to have at least a small community of like-minded people wherever we live. Big on mutual aid. We don't need to be in a totally blue area, but also don't want to get run out of town for believing in climate change.

\-somewhere with some art, music, culture, cool stuff, maybe a little grungy

\-looking for somewhere green! We want to have a garden with a somewhat decent and would love access to other produce. This is a BIG DEAL to me. I grew up in AZ and they are steadily running out of water. I want to live somewhere where this isn't a major concern.

\-ideally somewhere that doesn't get TOO cold or TOO snowy, but we're coming from Denver, so we can handle some. This means I want to avoid a place where it rarely gets above 20 in the winter or it heavy snow stays all winter long. Were used to temps 20-50 all winter and snow of 1/8in-2 feet several times a month. My friends' stories about the midwest changed my perception of what cold actually means.

\-also somewhere that isn't wildly hot. I lived in Phoenix for awhile, and that was too hot. Denver gets into the 100s sometimes and it's not fun, but manageable.

\-sunshine - I don't need anywhere as sunny as Denver, but I'd love to see the sun at least a few times a month in the winter.

\-accessible hiking/biking/camping. The southwest has an excess of free public lands that we've gotten used to.

\-affordable! We're hoping to buy a house for under $400k with a decent yard. If we could get acreage in that price, that would be incredible.

\-safety/low crime is important to us at this point. We'll be starting a family in the next five years, so also decent schools.

\-ideally, we'd like to live in a smaller town (under 100k people) and could be very small (under 5k), if it's within 30 min of a bigger town/city where we could access all the necessities. Would love to be able to walk to some basics, but still have space.

Clarification:

I grew up in a town of 50k people and that was WAY big enough to live in without any other city nearby. My partner grew up in a town of 1500 with some real basics. There was a bigger city (200k) within 30 minutes. Both of these are great.

My dad lives in rural florida (not even in a town) and it's 20 minutes to the closest business (a gas station), and another 15 to the closest town of like 2,000 people. For them to buy most necessities, they have to drive an hour to Wal-mart. I'm not interested in that level of rural.",2023-01-15 17:40:12+00:00

The newest HRRR run shows this impacting more of central and eastern Kentucky but weakening as it pushes into the state. This is definitely something to watch for most of the region.  

More rounds of strong to severe storms look possible Friday and Saturday, and the focus of these rounds should shift to the northeast of our round so far today.  Each MCS's timings, location, and severity are still in question.  Uncertainty is high because of the difficulty of forecasting these Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS's) riding along the edge of a ridge.

350,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, snowfall, love",Looking to move to Kentucky. Would love some real life info on some places.,"So to make a very long story short (will try to be organized) in the next couple years my mother and I and possibly my brother are looking at selling both our houses in upstate NY (god I hate it here) and moving to Kentucky.

We have looked into a lot of info to pick a state and are pretty set on Kentucky for a number of reasons. That being said we have never moved out of state or looked and it's a bit hard online to sort the reality & truth from the bs and pomp.

I will try to highlight some keypoints of what we are looking for but would appreciate ANY help in narrowing down good cities to look into or just as importantly good cities to AVOID.

&#x200B;

* We are looking for suburbs. This is pretty important. We like our own space and while we don't want full blown country with the nearest hospital or store being an hour away we would like to avoid a street with house after house on top of each other.  Suburbs with a 10-20 minute city away would be great. Would like businesses/stores/doctors/fast food places/jobs etc within a realistic distance away.
* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state. We enjoy all 4 seasons but living currently near buffalo we are so done with snow storms that give us literally feet of lake effect snow. On the flip side not a huge fan of super hot and humid. I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine. We are NOT looking for a fixer upper or a ""dump"" that needs a ton of work. Probably something  like 2-3 bedrooms 2-3 bathrooms. Does not need to have a huge yard or a ton of land (actually don't want a  TON of land).
* Amenities and attractions and such don't matter very much. We both spend the majority of our time in house or in yard and don't ever really go out much besides for normal shopping and such. Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

Anyway thought I would ask reddit because it's such good source of factual info. Any help would be appreciated. Probably won't be moving for 2-3 years but would like to start narrowing things down and at least finding a good area to look in.  Any help from anyone out there who has a nice area or has visited a nice area or any info at all would be awesome.

Thanks in advance!!

* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine. We are NOT looking for a fixer upper or a ""dump"" that needs a ton of work. Probably something  like 2-3 bedrooms 2-3 bathrooms. Does not need to have a huge yard or a ton of land (actually don't want a  TON of land).
* Amenities and attractions and such don't matter very much. We both spend the majority of our time in house or in yard and don't ever really go out much besides for normal shopping and such. Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

Anyway thought I would ask reddit because it's such good source of factual info. Any help would be appreciated. Probably won't be moving for 2-3 years but would like to start narrowing things down and at least finding a good area to look in.  Any help from anyone out there who has a nice area or has visited a nice area or any info at all would be awesome.

Thanks in advance!!

Happy Thursday, everyone!  All eyes are on our severe storm threat over the next three days as rounds of showers and storms look to ride along the edge of a building ridge.  This morning a complex of strong to severe storms is pushing across parts of western Kentucky.  Damaging winds have been the main threat thus far.

Later this evening, another round of storms looks to roll across the state.  The location of this round is still in question.  The latest hi-res models are showing this cluster all over the place.  The newest HRRR run shows this impacting more of central and eastern Kentucky but weakening as it pushes into the state. This is definitely something to watch for most of the region.  

More rounds of strong to severe storms look possible Friday and Saturday, and the focus of these rounds should shift to the northeast of our round so far today.  Each MCS's timings, location, and severity are still in question.  Uncertainty is high because of the difficulty of forecasting these Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS's) riding along the edge of a ridge.

We have looked into a lot of info to pick a state and are pretty set on Kentucky for a number of reasons. That being said we have never moved out of state or looked and it's a bit hard online to sort the reality & truth from the bs and pomp.

I will try to highlight some keypoints of what we are looking for but would appreciate ANY help in narrowing down good cities to look into or just as importantly good cities to AVOID.

&#x200B;

* We are looking for suburbs. This is pretty important. We like our own space and while we don't want full blown country with the nearest hospital or store being an hour away we would like to avoid a street with house after house on top of each other.  Suburbs with a 10-20 minute city away would be great. Would like businesses/stores/doctors/fast food places/jobs etc within a realistic distance away.
* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state. We enjoy all 4 seasons but living currently near buffalo we are so done with snow storms that give us literally feet of lake effect snow. On the flip side not a huge fan of super hot and humid. I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine. We are NOT looking for a fixer upper or a ""dump"" that needs a ton of work. Probably something  like 2-3 bedrooms 2-3 bathrooms. Does not need to have a huge yard or a ton of land (actually don't want a  TON of land).
* Amenities and attractions and such don't matter very much. We both spend the majority of our time in house or in yard and don't ever really go out much besides for normal shopping and such. Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

Anyway thought I would ask reddit because it's such good source of factual info. Any help would be appreciated. Probably won't be moving for 2-3 years but would like to start narrowing things down and at least finding a good area to look in.  Any help from anyone out there who has a nice area or has visited a nice area or any info at all would be awesome.

Thanks in advance!!

Happy Thursday, everyone!  All eyes are on our severe storm threat over the next three days as rounds of showers and storms look to ride along the edge of a building ridge.  This morning a complex of strong to severe storms is pushing across parts of western Kentucky.  Damaging winds have been the main threat thus far.

Later this evening, another round of storms looks to roll across the state.  The location of this round is still in question.  The latest hi-res models are showing this cluster all over the place.  The newest HRRR run shows this impacting more of central and eastern Kentucky but weakening as it pushes into the state. This is definitely something to watch for most of the region.  

More rounds of strong to severe storms look possible Friday and Saturday, and the focus of these rounds should shift to the northeast of our round so far today.  Each MCS's timings, location, and severity are still in question.  Uncertainty is high because of the difficulty of forecasting these Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS's) riding along the edge of a ridge.

400,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, love",Moving From OR to KY: Is This a Match?,"My husband and I are in our early 30’s looking to cash in on our equity from our pricey Oregon area and are thinking about moving to central Kentucky/Bluegrass region. We are planning our first trip for February. We currently live in a rural county, a few miles outside of the nicest, richest city in our county with a population of 25k. We are within 30 minutes to several similar sized cities/towns with shopping or restaurant options. We have a small several acre property and keep small livestock. My husband and I both own own businesses and work from home. We make around $160k combined per year currently, and would like to steer clear from areas known for drugs or crime as we hope to start a family. We like a country, slower paced, less populated way of life but still like to go out to eat and meet at coffee shops with friends, etc. every now and again and don’t mind driving 30ish minutes to do so. We are mostly homebodies, love walking/hiking, country drives, kayaking, ATVs, we are interested in horses, keeping livestock animals, and love our dogs. 
 
Why we’re attracted to Kentucky:
1.     Affordability
2.     Land with seemingly decent looking/sized houses with shops and barns (you have to pay around $1m for that in our current area)
3.     In the Bluegrass region, properties seem close-ish to the two main cities for entertainment, connections, etc. 
4.     4 seasons
5.     Even just a tiny bit of snow? We get get zero now, so any at all would be neat
6.     People are nice? We read it’s a highly rated area for “nice” folks. Oregon, not so much...
7.     Horses
8.     Near lots of different states and areas; the midwest, the south, the east coast 
 
Things we’re worried about:
1.     Humid summers; our summers are 0%
2.     Tornadoes! More insight/info on living alongside these would be so helpful
3.     Snakes; only ever see the occasional garden snake here now
 
If anyone has opinions on if Kentucky seems like a good fit for us and has any additional info, education, or insights into anything regarding Kentucky, but also about our concern points, that would be so helpful! Thank you!",2024-01-11 02:49:16+00:00
401,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snow, love",Where should we live?," 

My partner and I are moving from Denver, CO as soon as I finish grad school and are looking for our next home. Here's a little bit about us and what we're ideally looking for (edit: I realize this is idealistic, and we're ready to make some compromises as needed):

\-I'll be working as a therapist & would love to have good opportunities for jobs with decent pay. I'm finishing a very long grad program in May!

\-My partner has recently started working as a paralegal

\-we're both pretty left-leaning politically and would like to have at least a small community of like-minded people wherever we live. Big on mutual aid. We don't need to be in a totally blue area, but also don't want to get run out of town for believing in climate change.

\-somewhere with some art, music, culture, cool stuff, maybe a little grungy

\-looking for somewhere green! We want to have a garden with a somewhat decent and would love access to other produce. This is a BIG DEAL to me. I grew up in AZ and they are steadily running out of water. I want to live somewhere where this isn't a major concern.

\-ideally somewhere that doesn't get TOO cold or TOO snowy, but we're coming from Denver, so we can handle some. This means I want to avoid a place where it rarely gets above 20 in the winter or it heavy snow stays all winter long. Were used to temps 20-50 all winter and snow of 1/8in-2 feet several times a month. My friends' stories about the midwest changed my perception of what cold actually means.

\-also somewhere that isn't wildly hot. I lived in Phoenix for awhile, and that was too hot. Denver gets into the 100s sometimes and it's not fun, but manageable.

\-sunshine - I don't need anywhere as sunny as Denver, but I'd love to see the sun at least a few times a month in the winter.

\-accessible hiking/biking/camping. The southwest has an excess of free public lands that we've gotten used to.

\-affordable! We're hoping to buy a house for under $400k with a decent yard. If we could get acreage in that price, that would be incredible.

\-safety/low crime is important to us at this point. We'll be starting a family in the next five years, so also decent schools.

\-ideally, we'd like to live in a smaller town (under 100k people) and could be very small (under 5k), if it's within 30 min of a bigger town/city where we could access all the necessities. Would love to be able to walk to some basics, but still have space.

Clarification:

I grew up in a town of 50k people and that was WAY big enough to live in without any other city nearby. My partner grew up in a town of 1500 with some real basics. There was a bigger city (200k) within 30 minutes. Both of these are great.

My dad lives in rural florida (not even in a town) and it's 20 minutes to the closest business (a gas station), and another 15 to the closest town of like 2,000 people.

Would love some real life info on some places.,"So to make a very long story short (will try to be organized) in the next couple years my mother and I and possibly my brother are looking at selling both our houses in upstate NY (god I hate it here) and moving to Kentucky.

We have looked into a lot of info to pick a state and are pretty set on Kentucky for a number of reasons. That being said we have never moved out of state or looked and it's a bit hard online to sort the reality & truth from the bs and pomp.

I will try to highlight some keypoints of what we are looking for but would appreciate ANY help in narrowing down good cities to look into or just as importantly good cities to AVOID.

&#x200B;

* We are looking for suburbs. This is pretty important. We like our own space and while we don't want full blown country with the nearest hospital or store being an hour away we would like to avoid a street with house after house on top of each other.  Suburbs with a 10-20 minute city away would be great. Would like businesses/stores/doctors/fast food places/jobs etc within a realistic distance away.
* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state. We enjoy all 4 seasons but living currently near buffalo we are so done with snow storms that give us literally feet of lake effect snow. On the flip side not a huge fan of super hot and humid. I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine. We are NOT looking for a fixer upper or a ""dump"" that needs a ton of work. Probably something  like 2-3 bedrooms 2-3 bathrooms. Does not need to have a huge yard or a ton of land (actually don't want a  TON of land).
* Amenities and attractions and such don't matter very much. We both spend the majority of our time in house or in yard and don't ever really go out much besides for normal shopping and such. Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

Anyway thought I would ask reddit because it's such good source of factual info. Any help would be appreciated. Probably won't be moving for 2-3 years but would like to start narrowing things down and at least finding a good area to look in.  Any help from anyone out there who has a nice area or has visited a nice area or any info at all would be awesome.

Thanks in advance!!

420,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, snowy, love",Where should we live?," 

My partner and I are moving from Denver, CO as soon as I finish grad school and are looking for our next home. Here's a little bit about us and what we're ideally looking for (edit: I realize this is idealistic, and we're ready to make some compromises as needed):

\-I'll be working as a therapist & would love to have good opportunities for jobs with decent pay. I'm finishing a very long grad program in May!

\-My partner has recently started working as a paralegal

\-we're both pretty left-leaning politically and would like to have at least a small community of like-minded people wherever we live. Big on mutual aid. We don't need to be in a totally blue area, but also don't want to get run out of town for believing in climate change.

\-somewhere with some art, music, culture, cool stuff, maybe a little grungy

\-looking for somewhere green! We want to have a garden with a somewhat decent and would love access to other produce. This is a BIG DEAL to me. I grew up in AZ and they are steadily running out of water. I want to live somewhere where this isn't a major concern.

\-ideally somewhere that doesn't get TOO cold or TOO snowy, but we're coming from Denver, so we can handle some. This means I want to avoid a place where it rarely gets above 20 in the winter or it heavy snow stays all winter long. Were used to temps 20-50 all winter and snow of 1/8in-2 feet several times a month. My friends' stories about the midwest changed my perception of what cold actually means.

\-also somewhere that isn't wildly hot. I lived in Phoenix for awhile, and that was too hot. Denver gets into the 100s sometimes and it's not fun, but manageable.

\-sunshine - I don't need anywhere as sunny as Denver, but I'd love to see the sun at least a few times a month in the winter.

\-accessible hiking/biking/camping. The southwest has an excess of free public lands that we've gotten used to.

\-affordable! We're hoping to buy a house for under $400k with a decent yard. If we could get acreage in that price, that would be incredible.

\-safety/low crime is important to us at this point. We'll be starting a family in the next five years, so also decent schools.

\-ideally, we'd like to live in a smaller town (under 100k people) and could be very small (under 5k), if it's within 30 min of a bigger town/city where we could access all the necessities. Would love to be able to walk to some basics, but still have space.

Clarification:

I grew up in a town of 50k people and that was WAY big enough to live in without any other city nearby. My partner grew up in a town of 1500 with some real basics. There was a bigger city (200k) within 30 minutes. Both of these are great.

My dad lives in rural florida (not even in a town) and it's 20 minutes to the closest business (a gas station), and another 15 to the closest town of like 2,000 people. For them to buy most necessities, they have to drive an hour to Wal-mart. I'm not interested in that level of rural.",2023-01-15 17:40:12+00:00
