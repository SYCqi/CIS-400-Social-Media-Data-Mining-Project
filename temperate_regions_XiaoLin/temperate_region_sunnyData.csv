1,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, love",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

6,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, love",Day 7-10 Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America)," 

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

9,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

10,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00

12,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, enjoy",Thank You Kansas (Walking Across America),"&#x200B;

Howdy y’all,

So I finished walking across Kansas on Wednesday after crossing into St. Joseph over the Missouri river. I did a little post for my last couple of days in Kansas but just wanted to do a little wrap up/thank you post for the entire experience. 

Something I always tell people is that America is more the people than the land and I really do believe Kansas is the embodiment of that. I can promise that the state is much more than farmland. From my very first steps in Kansas I met incredible friendly people such as Tanner, who brought me lunch and welcomed me into the home he built. I received kindness until the very last full day in Kansas where I was graciously hosted for lunch by Kristin and Vineet and then hosted for the evening by Jennifer and Jason. In between, I met so many friendly and wonderful people who were supportive and encouraging of my journey. 

Prior to getting to the state, I really didn’t know what to expect, except thinking that I would be on US-36 for the majority of the walk. However the walk became pretty predictable. I would get up around 7:30 after having spent the night in a campground/city park. I always start my day with some food, a little stretching and brushing my teeth. Then I would be on my way through farm country as I waved to semi-truck drivers and the people who got over for me. The day would probably be a bit windy and sunny as I trudged along. After a 30ish mile day, I would get to a county seat sometime in the afternoon with its brick lined roads and music playing from speakers in the downtown. I would stop at the local grocer for some things and head to a Mexican restaurant for some food. After a nice meal, I would head to the city campground, do some stretching and then pitch my tent under a picnic shelter and rest as the traffic on 36 slowly died down over the course of the night. Then we would get up and do it the next day with a little variation here and there. The consistency was unlike other states. Very fortunate for all of the public campgrounds. If your town doesn't have one, I highly recommend reaching out to your local officials to get one. I was so appreciative of them.

Along with appreciating the campgrounds, I really enjoyed getting to learn about Kansas. Whether it was the Orphan Train, The Kansas Experiment, The Ogallala Aquifer, Smokey Bear (not Smokey the bear), how much a tractor costs, the affinity for “Eat Beef” license plates, the Davis Memorial, gas station pizza and so much more. There really is so much to learn everywhere you go even in some of these small towns. I know I didn’t even visit any of the bigger cities in Kansas, but hopefully I will be back to see them again one day. 

I am very thankful to all the people who followed my adventure through their state and/or reached out. I got some great intel and insights from so many of you. Initially, I was hesitant to post because I did not think anyone would care. But that did not seem to be the case and I am very much appreciative for all who followed along. It was encouraging enough that I will continue to post in the subreddit of whatever state I’m in for the foreseeable future. So if you are interested in following the rest of my journey consider checking out r/missouri or my website walk2washington.com where these posts will appear in the blog. Place I am most active is IG at walk2washington, but all of that stuff goes to FB at I believe Washington2Washington.

Lastly, a call to action for anybody reading this. Please go out and walk more. Go walk around your neighborhood, go walk to get your groceries or an errand you usually do, go walk to your work, walk to school, park farther than where you normally would from a destination and make up the difference by walking. If you are ambitious, get dropped off somewhere and walk back, walk to the next town over, hell walk across Kansas if you can. I don’t know your circumstances and you will know what kind of walking works best for you. Not only is it great for your physical and mental well-being, but it will also give you a new perspective on the world around you. Just go out and walk.

That is all from me Kansas, the state was much more than just cornfields and wind and I was very fortunate to have walked through the Sunflower State. Wish me luck in Missouri and Ad Astra per Aspera.

13,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, enjoy",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

27,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, love",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00
28,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, love",What's Kansas climate like?,"Hi folks,

I'm ever curious and was wondering if you could tell me more about the climate, weather, and seasons in Kansas. I can look at temperature indexes but without living it its it's hard to get a good sense of things. 

(I’m mainly interested in central Kansas, or the most isolated areas, but any region interests me too – are there any stark differences between regions?)

What months are known for what weather? What does that weather feel like? 

Is it hot/humid/freezing? Does the air feel heavy, smell of something in particular, or tell you anything about the weather to come?

What’s the season that makes you let out a sigh of relief? Which one brings tension?

I’ve never lived here so I wouldn’t even know what unique aspects to ask about, but any and all stories would be appreciated. Not just exciting things like tornados.

Thank you so much for helping me along with some research.",2023-12-11 21:16:35+00:00

32,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, love",Kansas the Time to Ditch Gas and Switch to Heat Pumps Is Now,"There have been more posts and many people are talk just about how expensive gas heating has been getting here this year. If you are replacing your AC unit this summer or in the next few year I would highly suggest you look into getting a model that also functions as a heat pump(a cold climate one) installed, and just rip out your furnace. 

I ran the numbers for where I currently live and I estimated a heat pump is going to run about half of what last years heating cost in gas ran and that is with a high efficiency furnace. 

I plan in the next 5 years to remove all gas appliances from my home to save money. There is subsidies available to make it even more cheap. Heat pumps are cheaper then installing both an AC and Furnace, but will be more expensive then just an cheap AC unit, but given they can be more efficient then basic AC units at cooling so it can save money in the summer. 




I know what all the first responses are going to be 

>""Heat pumps don't work in the cold"" 

This is wrong, older older units loose performance in colder temperatures, but modern ones have no issues running well into the negatives here is someone having a Mitsubishi running just fine at -25F windchill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LPrSdN5P7M

Mr Cool Universal Series which is what I plan to probably install myself as there is one downside most installers say they won't work with air source heatpumps. 

>""Unparalleled Heating: 100% at -5°F outside temp*
78% Heating Capacity at -22°F outside temp*
Enhanced Cooling: 100% at 115°F outside temp*
78% Cooling Capacity at 130°F outside temp*""
https://mrcool.com/mrcool-universal-series-dc-inverter-heat-pump-air-conditioner-split-system/

Mitsubishi is selling heatpumps in Canada that run at 90% at -13F. 

You should be getting around 80% BTU output at -20F, Kansas is not all that cold its going to be running very efficiency 99% of the time, I don't plan to keep any kind of backup heating I don't think it is needed. Looking at the temperature records here in Manhattan, there only has been 4 temperature records below -22F, -18F was in 2021 in that freeze the heat pump certainly would have been running less efficiently, but still working. Obviously we aren't the colder part of Kansas, but something to keep in mind. 

Most models that are cold climate heat are also very efficient AC units the Mr Cool unit has double the SEER rating of the one i currently use so there would be savings during the summer as well. The DOE has also been doing funding for more domestic cold weather heatpumps and trying to push their temperatures further, so by the time your replacing things in a few years they could be even better. 

The benefits extend beyond saving you money, if your furnace is your only gas appliance you can eliminate the risk of Carbon Monoxide in your home or an explosive gas leak. 

Not to say there won't be issues, you are going to have to deal with making sure snow does not bury it, but this can mean just getting it up more off the ground, it won't be free, you will see an increase in your electric bill. 


In an extremely poorly built home it might not have the raw BTUs to keep up that a large gas furnace can output, so you may want to improve that with air sealing in your attic, adding insulation that is ideally not fiberglass, upgrading windows ect. 



This is a pretty good video on heat pumps

Technology Connections:  Heat Pumps are Not Hard: Here's what it will take to start pumping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43XKfuptnik


Edit:

Someone is also going to argue that electricity won't be heating when the power is out, guess what neither will your furnace be blowing hot air when the electricity is out even if its gas due to electric ignition and blower that all run on electricity.

Edit Edit:

I am starting to suspect some people might have been told they were getting a cold climate model from their HVAC installer when they actually cheapened out and put in one not made for our climate and pocketed the money. That or HVAC installers are assuming a heat pump is a heat pump. 

There is videos of people in Canada using them, Norway uses a ton of them. What do you think is more likely these people don't have heating that works below 32F, OR maybe your HVAC installer fucked up and didn't get the correct models. 

If you do want to get a heat pump ask your installer for the spec sheet and what temperatures it is rated for, I wouldn't put in anything that does not work at least 80% performance at -5F and really think the ones like the Mr Cool, and Mitsubishi units that keep that into the -20F would perform in all conditions here in Kansas and those wouldn't even need aux heating.",2023-03-02 03:30:31+00:00

37,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, hate",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

39,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, hate",Kansas the Time to Ditch Gas and Switch to Heat Pumps Is Now,"There have been more posts and many people are talk just about how expensive gas heating has been getting here this year. If you are replacing your AC unit this summer or in the next few year I would highly suggest you look into getting a model that also functions as a heat pump(a cold climate one) installed, and just rip out your furnace. 

I ran the numbers for where I currently live and I estimated a heat pump is going to run about half of what last years heating cost in gas ran and that is with a high efficiency furnace. 

I plan in the next 5 years to remove all gas appliances from my home to save money. There is subsidies available to make it even more cheap. Heat pumps are cheaper then installing both an AC and Furnace, but will be more expensive then just an cheap AC unit, but given they can be more efficient then basic AC units at cooling so it can save money in the summer. 




I know what all the first responses are going to be 

>""Heat pumps don't work in the cold"" 

This is wrong, older older units loose performance in colder temperatures, but modern ones have no issues running well into the negatives here is someone having a Mitsubishi running just fine at -25F windchill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LPrSdN5P7M

Mr Cool Universal Series which is what I plan to probably install myself as there is one downside most installers say they won't work with air source heatpumps. 

>""Unparalleled Heating: 100% at -5°F outside temp*
78% Heating Capacity at -22°F outside temp*
Enhanced Cooling: 100% at 115°F outside temp*
78% Cooling Capacity at 130°F outside temp*""
https://mrcool.com/mrcool-universal-series-dc-inverter-heat-pump-air-conditioner-split-system/

Mitsubishi is selling heatpumps in Canada that run at 90% at -13F. 

You should be getting around 80% BTU output at -20F, Kansas is not all that cold its going to be running very efficiency 99% of the time, I don't plan to keep any kind of backup heating I don't think it is needed. Looking at the temperature records here in Manhattan, there only has been 4 temperature records below -22F, -18F was in 2021 in that freeze the heat pump certainly would have been running less efficiently, but still working. Obviously we aren't the colder part of Kansas, but something to keep in mind. 

Most models that are cold climate heat are also very efficient AC units the Mr Cool unit has double the SEER rating of the one i currently use so there would be savings during the summer as well. The DOE has also been doing funding for more domestic cold weather heatpumps and trying to push their temperatures further, so by the time your replacing things in a few years they could be even better. 

The benefits extend beyond saving you money, if your furnace is your only gas appliance you can eliminate the risk of Carbon Monoxide in your home or an explosive gas leak. 

Not to say there won't be issues, you are going to have to deal with making sure snow does not bury it, but this can mean just getting it up more off the ground, it won't be free, you will see an increase in your electric bill. 


In an extremely poorly built home it might not have the raw BTUs to keep up that a large gas furnace can output, so you may want to improve that with air sealing in your attic, adding insulation that is ideally not fiberglass, upgrading windows ect. 



This is a pretty good video on heat pumps

Technology Connections:  Heat Pumps are Not Hard: Here's what it will take to start pumping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43XKfuptnik


Edit:

Someone is also going to argue that electricity won't be heating when the power is out, guess what neither will your furnace be blowing hot air when the electricity is out even if its gas due to electric ignition and blower that all run on electricity.

Edit Edit:

I am starting to suspect some people might have been told they were getting a cold climate model from their HVAC installer when they actually cheapened out and put in one not made for our climate and pocketed the money. That or HVAC installers are assuming a heat pump is a heat pump. 

There is videos of people in Canada using them, Norway uses a ton of them. What do you think is more likely these people don't have heating that works below 32F, OR maybe your HVAC installer fucked up and didn't get the correct models. 

If you do want to get a heat pump ask your installer for the spec sheet and what temperatures it is rated for, I wouldn't put in anything that does not work at least 80% performance at -5F and really think the ones like the Mr Cool, and Mitsubishi units that keep that into the -20F would perform in all conditions here in Kansas and those wouldn't even need aux heating.",2023-03-02 03:30:31+00:00

42,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars.

46,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, enjoy",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00

Mitsubishi is selling heatpumps in Canada that run at 90% at -13F. 

You should be getting around 80% BTU output at -20F, Kansas is not all that cold its going to be running very efficiency 99% of the time, I don't plan to keep any kind of backup heating I don't think it is needed. Looking at the temperature records here in Manhattan, there only has been 4 temperature records below -22F, -18F was in 2021 in that freeze the heat pump certainly would have been running less efficiently, but still working. Obviously we aren't the colder part of Kansas, but something to keep in mind. 

Most models that are cold climate heat are also very efficient AC units the Mr Cool unit has double the SEER rating of the one i currently use so there would be savings during the summer as well. The DOE has also been doing funding for more domestic cold weather heatpumps and trying to push their temperatures further, so by the time your replacing things in a few years they could be even better. 

The benefits extend beyond saving you money, if your furnace is your only gas appliance you can eliminate the risk of Carbon Monoxide in your home or an explosive gas leak. 

Not to say there won't be issues, you are going to have to deal with making sure snow does not bury it, but this can mean just getting it up more off the ground, it won't be free, you will see an increase in your electric bill. 


In an extremely poorly built home it might not have the raw BTUs to keep up that a large gas furnace can output, so you may want to improve that with air sealing in your attic, adding insulation that is ideally not fiberglass, upgrading windows ect. 



This is a pretty good video on heat pumps

Technology Connections:  Heat Pumps are Not Hard: Here's what it will take to start pumping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43XKfuptnik


Edit:

Someone is also going to argue that electricity won't be heating when the power is out, guess what neither will your furnace be blowing hot air when the electricity is out even if its gas due to electric ignition and blower that all run on electricity.

Edit Edit:

I am starting to suspect some people might have been told they were getting a cold climate model from their HVAC installer when they actually cheapened out and put in one not made for our climate and pocketed the money. That or HVAC installers are assuming a heat pump is a heat pump. 

There is videos of people in Canada using them, Norway uses a ton of them. What do you think is more likely these people don't have heating that works below 32F, OR maybe your HVAC installer fucked up and didn't get the correct models. 

If you do want to get a heat pump ask your installer for the spec sheet and what temperatures it is rated for, I wouldn't put in anything that does not work at least 80% performance at -5F and really think the ones like the Mr Cool, and Mitsubishi units that keep that into the -20F would perform in all conditions here in Kansas and those wouldn't even need aux heating.",2023-03-02 03:30:31+00:00
48,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, enjoy",Day 7-10 Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America)," 

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

I'm ever curious and was wondering if you could tell me more about the climate, weather, and seasons in Kansas. I can look at temperature indexes but without living it its it's hard to get a good sense of things. 

(I’m mainly interested in central Kansas, or the most isolated areas, but any region interests me too – are there any stark differences between regions?)

What months are known for what weather? What does that weather feel like? 

Is it hot/humid/freezing? Does the air feel heavy, smell of something in particular, or tell you anything about the weather to come?

What’s the season that makes you let out a sigh of relief? Which one brings tension?

I’ve never lived here so I wouldn’t even know what unique aspects to ask about, but any and all stories would be appreciated. Not just exciting things like tornados.

Thank you so much for helping me along with some research.",2023-12-11 21:16:35+00:00
53,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, dislike",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00
54,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, dislike",Kansas the Time to Ditch Gas and Switch to Heat Pumps Is Now,"There have been more posts and many people are talk just about how expensive gas heating has been getting here this year. If you are replacing your AC unit this summer or in the next few year I would highly suggest you look into getting a model that also functions as a heat pump(a cold climate one) installed, and just rip out your furnace. 

I ran the numbers for where I currently live and I estimated a heat pump is going to run about half of what last years heating cost in gas ran and that is with a high efficiency furnace. 

I plan in the next 5 years to remove all gas appliances from my home to save money. There is subsidies available to make it even more cheap. Heat pumps are cheaper then installing both an AC and Furnace, but will be more expensive then just an cheap AC unit, but given they can be more efficient then basic AC units at cooling so it can save money in the summer. 




I know what all the first responses are going to be 

>""Heat pumps don't work in the cold"" 

This is wrong, older older units loose performance in colder temperatures, but modern ones have no issues running well into the negatives here is someone having a Mitsubishi running just fine at -25F windchill.

I'm ever curious and was wondering if you could tell me more about the climate, weather, and seasons in Kansas. I can look at temperature indexes but without living it its it's hard to get a good sense of things.

59,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, happy",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

61,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, happy",Kansas the Time to Ditch Gas and Switch to Heat Pumps Is Now,"There have been more posts and many people are talk just about how expensive gas heating has been getting here this year. If you are replacing your AC unit this summer or in the next few year I would highly suggest you look into getting a model that also functions as a heat pump(a cold climate one) installed, and just rip out your furnace. 

I ran the numbers for where I currently live and I estimated a heat pump is going to run about half of what last years heating cost in gas ran and that is with a high efficiency furnace. 

I plan in the next 5 years to remove all gas appliances from my home to save money. There is subsidies available to make it even more cheap. Heat pumps are cheaper then installing both an AC and Furnace, but will be more expensive then just an cheap AC unit, but given they can be more efficient then basic AC units at cooling so it can save money in the summer. 




I know what all the first responses are going to be 

>""Heat pumps don't work in the cold"" 

This is wrong, older older units loose performance in colder temperatures, but modern ones have no issues running well into the negatives here is someone having a Mitsubishi running just fine at -25F windchill.

Mr Cool Universal Series which is what I plan to probably install myself as there is one downside most installers say they won't work with air source heatpumps. 

>""Unparalleled Heating: 100% at -5°F outside temp*
78% Heating Capacity at -22°F outside temp*

https://mrcool.com/mrcool-universal-series-dc-inverter-heat-pump-air-conditioner-split-system/

Mitsubishi is selling heatpumps in Canada that run at 90% at -13F. 

You should be getting around 80% BTU output at -20F, Kansas is not all that cold its going to be running very efficiency 99% of the time, I don't plan to keep any kind of backup heating I don't think it is needed. Looking at the temperature records here in Manhattan, there only has been 4 temperature records below -22F, -18F was in 2021 in that freeze the heat pump certainly would have been running less efficiently, but still working. Obviously we aren't the colder part of Kansas, but something to keep in mind. 

Most models that are cold climate heat are also very efficient AC units the Mr Cool unit has double the SEER rating of the one i currently use so there would be savings during the summer as well. The DOE has also been doing funding for more domestic cold weather heatpumps and trying to push their temperatures further, so by the time your replacing things in a few years they could be even better. 

The benefits extend beyond saving you money, if your furnace is your only gas appliance you can eliminate the risk of Carbon Monoxide in your home or an explosive gas leak. 

Not to say there won't be issues, you are going to have to deal with making sure snow does not bury it, but this can mean just getting it up more off the ground, it won't be free, you will see an increase in your electric bill.

Cute towns (the ones you'd refer to as a postcard town) 

All things tacky (worlds largest this, worlds most haunted that) 

Good food (best pie, beef jerky, burgers, hot dogs, doughnuts etc)

Gas stations with the best snacks and cleanest bathrooms 

Bonus points on all of these if they are pet friendly.  The car I'll be taking has a remote starter, so the pups will be able to be left alone comfortably in the car for a short time. But, this isn't ideal for obvious reasons

71,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, comfortable",Kansas the Time to Ditch Gas and Switch to Heat Pumps Is Now,"There have been more posts and many people are talk just about how expensive gas heating has been getting here this year. If you are replacing your AC unit this summer or in the next few year I would highly suggest you look into getting a model that also functions as a heat pump(a cold climate one) installed, and just rip out your furnace. 

I ran the numbers for where I currently live and I estimated a heat pump is going to run about half of what last years heating cost in gas ran and that is with a high efficiency furnace. 

I plan in the next 5 years to remove all gas appliances from my home to save money. There is subsidies available to make it even more cheap. Heat pumps are cheaper then installing both an AC and Furnace, but will be more expensive then just an cheap AC unit, but given they can be more efficient then basic AC units at cooling so it can save money in the summer. 




I know what all the first responses are going to be 

>""Heat pumps don't work in the cold"" 

This is wrong, older older units loose performance in colder temperatures, but modern ones have no issues running well into the negatives here is someone having a Mitsubishi running just fine at -25F windchill.

Mitsubishi is selling heatpumps in Canada that run at 90% at -13F. 

You should be getting around 80% BTU output at -20F, Kansas is not all that cold its going to be running very efficiency 99% of the time, I don't plan to keep any kind of backup heating I don't think it is needed. Looking at the temperature records here in Manhattan, there only has been 4 temperature records below -22F, -18F was in 2021 in that freeze the heat pump certainly would have been running less efficiently, but still working. Obviously we aren't the colder part of Kansas, but something to keep in mind. 

Most models that are cold climate heat are also very efficient AC units the Mr Cool unit has double the SEER rating of the one i currently use so there would be savings during the summer as well. The DOE has also been doing funding for more domestic cold weather heatpumps and trying to push their temperatures further, so by the time your replacing things in a few years they could be even better. 

The benefits extend beyond saving you money, if your furnace is your only gas appliance you can eliminate the risk of Carbon Monoxide in your home or an explosive gas leak. 

Not to say there won't be issues, you are going to have to deal with making sure snow does not bury it, but this can mean just getting it up more off the ground, it won't be free, you will see an increase in your electric bill. 


In an extremely poorly built home it might not have the raw BTUs to keep up that a large gas furnace can output, so you may want to improve that with air sealing in your attic, adding insulation that is ideally not fiberglass, upgrading windows ect.

Edit:

Someone is also going to argue that electricity won't be heating when the power is out, guess what neither will your furnace be blowing hot air when the electricity is out even if its gas due to electric ignition and blower that all run on electricity.

Edit Edit:

I am starting to suspect some people might have been told they were getting a cold climate model from their HVAC installer when they actually cheapened out and put in one not made for our climate and pocketed the money. That or HVAC installers are assuming a heat pump is a heat pump. 

There is videos of people in Canada using them, Norway uses a ton of them. What do you think is more likely these people don't have heating that works below 32F, OR maybe your HVAC installer fucked up and didn't get the correct models. 

If you do want to get a heat pump ask your installer for the spec sheet and what temperatures it is rated for, I wouldn't put in anything that does not work at least 80% performance at -5F and really think the ones like the Mr Cool, and Mitsubishi units that keep that into the -20F would perform in all conditions here in Kansas and those wouldn't even need aux heating.",2023-03-02 03:30:31+00:00

73,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, love",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives every thing its value.”

Tuesday was a powerful loss. Most of us have read his agenda 47, the Republican platform, and of course, the mandate for leadership. We know what’s coming. We know what he is going to try and do. And yes, it is formidable and it is scary. I am worried for my family. I am worried for what the future holds for me. And I’m worried for what the future looks like for the country.

I am tired and I am exhausted. I am tired of fighting for the right to exist. I am tired of fighting for the right to feel safe. I am tired of marginalized people in this country being the scapegoat. I am tired of the rights supposedly endowed by our creator to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness only applying to those as white and straight as the lined paper on the other side of the red lined margin. 

But, tired or not, I will fight. I will stand. For my spirit may be battered, but it is far from broken. My muscles may ache, but they are still strong. And my voice may be hoarse, but it is still powerful. I have shed my tears and cried my lament. I have spent time crumpled down in prayer and quiet anguish. Now it’s time to stand again. It’s time to dust myself off, and re-establish the chain forged in anger, sadness, and blessed sisterhood. The future is not set in stone. And the salt water that ruins their cement is more effective if it comes from our sweat, than if it comes from our tears.

We have two years to identify candidates, to campaign, and prepare to remove the teeth from the bumble. We must not look so far away as four years when the midterms are in 2026. We must start NOW to strategize and prepare to paint the house and senate in D.C, and in our states, blue. 

I gave too much of my energy, and my health to serve this country in order to just let it end like this. I am neither prepared to give up hope, nor ready to give up the fight. The future of our country lay ahead of us. And our legacy is born in moments like this. 

Let us fight…let us fight, like our lives and the lives of all of our siblings are on the line…like our very freedom to fight is what is at stake.

I’m down here for the summer to visit my family and they have this stray cat in the back yard they’ve been feeding for a few months now. My SIL posted on Facebook wondering if anyone in the area lost a cat cause he’s really loveable and friendly. She got a reply for a farmer saying they had a cat escape they’re vehicle passing through town. But he said they have no need for him and if we wanted him we can keep him if the cat was even him. And that was that. So we’ve been feeding him loving him and giving him some shelter outside but it’s not enough. 

His name is crusty. We have no idea on the age but if we had to guess he’s somewhere between 4-8? He still has his balls lol. He’s a vocal baby who really genuinely wants love. He’s gets on really well with our other indoor/outdoor cat and the dog too. Even though the dog hates him he still tries getting love from him. 

My worry is that he’s clearly got some medical issues going on like his constant sneezing weird cat coughs and the crusties (hence the name) around his eyes. And my father is in no way able to take in another animal with the financial situation he’s in especially a sick one. My SIL is pregnant too so they aren’t able to take in another cat aswell as they have a 1yr old kitten. 

Crusty is such a sweet boy and it sucks that a cat as sweet and lovable as him isn’t able to get that. If I could I’d take him in immediately. I myself live back home in Texas with my parents while going to college.

85,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, love",Day 7-10 Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America)," 

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

91,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, love",Riding the school bus to Vinland Kansas in the '60's,"We moved from Baldwin Kansas sometime during 1965 to a very rural area a few miles outside Vinland and it was culture shock right away. We'd always lived in small towns, Olathe, Gardner (twice), and then Baldwin and while I wasn't a big fan of school I did like living in Baldwin. It had everything you needed. A theater, college kids going to Baker, and actual college dorms scattered around town. During that summer I played in little league (Cardinals) and actually had to try out in those days to make the team. But then my world took a hit when we moved to a small 1/2 acre cut into the hillside. I can still see that red dirt and taste that rusty well water.   

Then came school at Vinland junior high for the 6th grade (we had junior high for 6, 7, and 8 there). The school was ancient but they had added on a more modern building for grades 1-5 and that part still lives I believe while the old building is gone. And I don't believe it's a school anymore. As it turned out life was even better for a kid there as we had 13 kids in our class and everyone was friendly. But the downside was riding the bus 2 hours a day, an hour in the morning, and an hour at night mainly because we were first on in the morning and last off at night.

If you have ever ridden on a bus on country roads it's like riding a rollercoaster up and down the rolling hills of eastern Kansas complete with enough ruts, bumps, and drops to shake your brain loose. I spent most of my time trying to read science fiction books while dealing with motion sickness but in the end, my need to read got me past the sick stomach. That two hours a day was a life in itself as we wound our way through tree-covered narrow gravel country roads where we often clipped through overhanging branches if we had to make room for a passing car, tractor, or combine on its way to a field somewhere. 

And it wasn't a slow trip as those bus drivers (often college students) drove like the wind ""bullseye"". We got tossed all over, bounce up and down constantly the entire trip, and since there were no seat belts you could if you were careful end up in the aisle and on your backside often with the driver's face in his large mirror looking back at us with a grin on his face.

Sometimes the gravel dust would come in through the always-open windows and try to choke us all to death when vehicles passed by. The only break we go was when the bus stopped to drop or pick someone up. So you had to catch your breath quickly. The nightly trips were different as everyone was more relaxed and talkative. The girls often sang songs for most of that hour, Henry the 8th I Am was a favorite and most of us boys would groan as they started up yet another round of Henry over and over and ...well. Nevermind. You get the drift. My sister, who was 18 months younger, and her friend Cheryl often led the singing which I would try to ignore except to look up to catch a peek at her best friend sitting with her. Someone I had a crush on for 3 years and never once did I ever let on how I felt. (still hurts a bit sometimes).

The weather often made the trips even more treacherous with mud and snow and we seldom missed a day of school too. It usually took an ice storm to keep us home from school. We boys did have some fun usually towards the end of the run as the bus emptied out we'd sit in the furthest back seats and then slide into the aisle where we'd stand and ""surf"" the bus and its wilding changing angles over hills and bumps. Sometimes we'd catch the driver watching us but he usually didn't say anything when we did it. My friend Tim (Chanay) and I talked about joining the air force and becoming fighter pilots one day. His dad flew crop dusters out of the Vinland Aerodrome.

While it could get exciting moving over into the overhanging tree limbs at breakneck speed at times for the most part we were never really in any danger except one day, one very cold and icy day a broken limb off a tree (apparently had broke due to the ice on the three and was just sitting on top of other branches while it waited for us to pass buy. A pickup truck forced the driver over and with a crash, that limb came through the front windshield and penetrated the bus at least 10 feet back into the seating area. It came within a foot of a little girl sitting ahead of us. Luckily, no one was seriously hurt as the bus was half empty at the time.

The only other thing that I remember happening was when a senior from the high school, one of the few that ever rode the bus, thought it funny to pull the cord on my jacket after he apparently looped it around my neck tight. I immediately started choking and my vision went black until the next thing I remember the driver was dragging the kid off the bus by the arm and escorted him off where he left him standing. We quickly came to another immediate stop as the driver lept off the bus and went running back towards the kid (who fully matched the driver in height) and started yelling at him. The kid had thrown a rock at the bus as we started to leave and that college kid wasted no time dealing with him. 

Besides those two incidents, it was just endless hills and bumps and roller coaster drops as we'd run over rattlesnakes crossing the road or rabbits and dogs dodging the bus as we passed by endless farmland nestled into surrounding timber forests. This went on for 3 years until I started going into Baldwin my ninth grade year for high school and not long after I started riding with friends in their cars and pickups into school. One was named Allan who had his 46 ford pickup he was so proud of. A truck without a working starter so he'd always park so we could push it and get it started by popping the clutch to get the engine going.

We moved away after my sophomore year and to this day I miss that school at Vinland and the new high school in Baldwin that opened my freshman year. That was the first school I ever experienced air conditioning since we never had it at home and in school until then.

I’m down here for the summer to visit my family and they have this stray cat in the back yard they’ve been feeding for a few months now. My SIL posted on Facebook wondering if anyone in the area lost a cat cause he’s really loveable and friendly. She got a reply for a farmer saying they had a cat escape they’re vehicle passing through town. But he said they have no need for him and if we wanted him we can keep him if the cat was even him. And that was that. So we’ve been feeding him loving him and giving him some shelter outside but it’s not enough. 

His name is crusty. We have no idea on the age but if we had to guess he’s somewhere between 4-8? He still has his balls lol. He’s a vocal baby who really genuinely wants love. He’s gets on really well with our other indoor/outdoor cat and the dog too. Even though the dog hates him he still tries getting love from him. 

My worry is that he’s clearly got some medical issues going on like his constant sneezing weird cat coughs and the crusties (hence the name) around his eyes. And my father is in no way able to take in another animal with the financial situation he’s in especially a sick one. My SIL is pregnant too so they aren’t able to take in another cat aswell as they have a 1yr old kitten. 

Crusty is such a sweet boy and it sucks that a cat as sweet and lovable as him isn’t able to get that. If I could I’d take him in immediately. I myself live back home in Texas with my parents while going to college. 

If you are interested or would like to know more please contact me!! I would love for this baby to get a forever home full of love. ",2024-07-13 01:16:04+00:00
97,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, hate",Kansas the Time to Ditch Gas and Switch to Heat Pumps Is Now,"There have been more posts and many people are talk just about how expensive gas heating has been getting here this year. If you are replacing your AC unit this summer or in the next few year I would highly suggest you look into getting a model that also functions as a heat pump(a cold climate one) installed, and just rip out your furnace. 

I ran the numbers for where I currently live and I estimated a heat pump is going to run about half of what last years heating cost in gas ran and that is with a high efficiency furnace. 

I plan in the next 5 years to remove all gas appliances from my home to save money. There is subsidies available to make it even more cheap. Heat pumps are cheaper then installing both an AC and Furnace, but will be more expensive then just an cheap AC unit, but given they can be more efficient then basic AC units at cooling so it can save money in the summer. 




I know what all the first responses are going to be 

>""Heat pumps don't work in the cold"" 

This is wrong, older older units loose performance in colder temperatures, but modern ones have no issues running well into the negatives here is someone having a Mitsubishi running just fine at -25F windchill.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LPrSdN5P7M

Mr Cool Universal Series which is what I plan to probably install myself as there is one downside most installers say they won't work with air source heatpumps. 

>""Unparalleled Heating: 100% at -5°F outside temp*
78% Heating Capacity at -22°F outside temp*
Enhanced Cooling: 100% at 115°F outside temp*
78% Cooling Capacity at 130°F outside temp*""
https://mrcool.com/mrcool-universal-series-dc-inverter-heat-pump-air-conditioner-split-system/

Mitsubishi is selling heatpumps in Canada that run at 90% at -13F. 

You should be getting around 80% BTU output at -20F, Kansas is not all that cold its going to be running very efficiency 99% of the time, I don't plan to keep any kind of backup heating I don't think it is needed. Looking at the temperature records here in Manhattan, there only has been 4 temperature records below -22F, -18F was in 2021 in that freeze the heat pump certainly would have been running less efficiently, but still working. Obviously we aren't the colder part of Kansas, but something to keep in mind. 

Most models that are cold climate heat are also very efficient AC units the Mr Cool unit has double the SEER rating of the one i currently use so there would be savings during the summer as well. The DOE has also been doing funding for more domestic cold weather heatpumps and trying to push their temperatures further, so by the time your replacing things in a few years they could be even better. 

The benefits extend beyond saving you money, if your furnace is your only gas appliance you can eliminate the risk of Carbon Monoxide in your home or an explosive gas leak. 

Not to say there won't be issues, you are going to have to deal with making sure snow does not bury it, but this can mean just getting it up more off the ground, it won't be free, you will see an increase in your electric bill. 


In an extremely poorly built home it might not have the raw BTUs to keep up that a large gas furnace can output, so you may want to improve that with air sealing in your attic, adding insulation that is ideally not fiberglass, upgrading windows ect. 



This is a pretty good video on heat pumps

Technology Connections:  Heat Pumps are Not Hard: Here's what it will take to start pumping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43XKfuptnik


Edit:

Someone is also going to argue that electricity won't be heating when the power is out, guess what neither will your furnace be blowing hot air when the electricity is out even if its gas due to electric ignition and blower that all run on electricity.

Edit Edit:

I am starting to suspect some people might have been told they were getting a cold climate model from their HVAC installer when they actually cheapened out and put in one not made for our climate and pocketed the money. That or HVAC installers are assuming a heat pump is a heat pump. 

There is videos of people in Canada using them, Norway uses a ton of them. What do you think is more likely these people don't have heating that works below 32F, OR maybe your HVAC installer fucked up and didn't get the correct models. 

If you do want to get a heat pump ask your installer for the spec sheet and what temperatures it is rated for, I wouldn't put in anything that does not work at least 80% performance at -5F and really think the ones like the Mr Cool, and Mitsubishi units that keep that into the -20F would perform in all conditions here in Kansas and those wouldn't even need aux heating.",2023-03-02 03:30:31+00:00

105,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-07 14:05:13+00:00
106,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00
107,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, enjoy",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

I’ve only visited the most western portion of Kansas once and had a great time, but what’s it like for folks who live in or around the eastern parts of the state? 

I know it gets pretty humid compared to the rest of the state during the summer, but how are the winters? Are the people cool and is the food any good? What do folks enjoy doing out there? 

These are just off the top of my head, but I’d appreciate any helpful input. Thanks!",2024-02-18 22:36:30+00:00
109,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, enjoy",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00

If you are replacing your AC unit this summer or in the next few year I would highly suggest you look into getting a model that also functions as a heat pump(a cold climate one) installed, and just rip out your furnace. 

I ran the numbers for where I currently live and I estimated a heat pump is going to run about half of what last years heating cost in gas ran and that is with a high efficiency furnace. 

I plan in the next 5 years to remove all gas appliances from my home to save money. There is subsidies available to make it even more cheap. Heat pumps are cheaper then installing both an AC and Furnace, but will be more expensive then just an cheap AC unit, but given they can be more efficient then basic AC units at cooling so it can save money in the summer. 




I know what all the first responses are going to be 

>""Heat pumps don't work in the cold"" 

This is wrong, older older units loose performance in colder temperatures, but modern ones have no issues running well into the negatives here is someone having a Mitsubishi running just fine at -25F windchill.

https://mrcool.com/mrcool-universal-series-dc-inverter-heat-pump-air-conditioner-split-system/

Mitsubishi is selling heatpumps in Canada that run at 90% at -13F. 

You should be getting around 80% BTU output at -20F, Kansas is not all that cold its going to be running very efficiency 99% of the time, I don't plan to keep any kind of backup heating I don't think it is needed. Looking at the temperature records here in Manhattan, there only has been 4 temperature records below -22F, -18F was in 2021 in that freeze the heat pump certainly would have been running less efficiently, but still working. Obviously we aren't the colder part of Kansas, but something to keep in mind. 

Most models that are cold climate heat are also very efficient AC units the Mr Cool unit has double the SEER rating of the one i currently use so there would be savings during the summer as well. The DOE has also been doing funding for more domestic cold weather heatpumps and trying to push their temperatures further, so by the time your replacing things in a few years they could be even better. 

The benefits extend beyond saving you money, if your furnace is your only gas appliance you can eliminate the risk of Carbon Monoxide in your home or an explosive gas leak. 

Not to say there won't be issues, you are going to have to deal with making sure snow does not bury it, but this can mean just getting it up more off the ground, it won't be free, you will see an increase in your electric bill. 


In an extremely poorly built home it might not have the raw BTUs to keep up that a large gas furnace can output, so you may want to improve that with air sealing in your attic, adding insulation that is ideally not fiberglass, upgrading windows ect. 



This is a pretty good video on heat pumps

Technology Connections:  Heat Pumps are Not Hard: Here's what it will take to start pumping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43XKfuptnik


Edit:

Someone is also going to argue that electricity won't be heating when the power is out, guess what neither will your furnace be blowing hot air when the electricity is out even if its gas due to electric ignition and blower that all run on electricity.

Edit Edit:

I am starting to suspect some people might have been told they were getting a cold climate model from their HVAC installer when they actually cheapened out and put in one not made for our climate and pocketed the money. That or HVAC installers are assuming a heat pump is a heat pump. 

There is videos of people in Canada using them, Norway uses a ton of them. What do you think is more likely these people don't have heating that works below 32F, OR maybe your HVAC installer fucked up and didn't get the correct models. 

If you do want to get a heat pump ask your installer for the spec sheet and what temperatures it is rated for, I wouldn't put in anything that does not work at least 80% performance at -5F and really think the ones like the Mr Cool, and Mitsubishi units that keep that into the -20F would perform in all conditions here in Kansas and those wouldn't even need aux heating.",2023-03-02 03:30:31+00:00
113,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, enjoy",Day 7-10 Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America)," 

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

117,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, enjoy",Riding the school bus to Vinland Kansas in the '60's,"We moved from Baldwin Kansas sometime during 1965 to a very rural area a few miles outside Vinland and it was culture shock right away. We'd always lived in small towns, Olathe, Gardner (twice), and then Baldwin and while I wasn't a big fan of school I did like living in Baldwin. It had everything you needed. A theater, college kids going to Baker, and actual college dorms scattered around town. During that summer I played in little league (Cardinals) and actually had to try out in those days to make the team. But then my world took a hit when we moved to a small 1/2 acre cut into the hillside. I can still see that red dirt and taste that rusty well water.   

Then came school at Vinland junior high for the 6th grade (we had junior high for 6, 7, and 8 there). The school was ancient but they had added on a more modern building for grades 1-5 and that part still lives I believe while the old building is gone. And I don't believe it's a school anymore. As it turned out life was even better for a kid there as we had 13 kids in our class and everyone was friendly. But the downside was riding the bus 2 hours a day, an hour in the morning, and an hour at night mainly because we were first on in the morning and last off at night.

If you have ever ridden on a bus on country roads it's like riding a rollercoaster up and down the rolling hills of eastern Kansas complete with enough ruts, bumps, and drops to shake your brain loose. I spent most of my time trying to read science fiction books while dealing with motion sickness but in the end, my need to read got me past the sick stomach. That two hours a day was a life in itself as we wound our way through tree-covered narrow gravel country roads where we often clipped through overhanging branches if we had to make room for a passing car, tractor, or combine on its way to a field somewhere. 

And it wasn't a slow trip as those bus drivers (often college students) drove like the wind ""bullseye"". We got tossed all over, bounce up and down constantly the entire trip, and since there were no seat belts you could if you were careful end up in the aisle and on your backside often with the driver's face in his large mirror looking back at us with a grin on his face.

Sometimes the gravel dust would come in through the always-open windows and try to choke us all to death when vehicles passed by. The only break we go was when the bus stopped to drop or pick someone up. So you had to catch your breath quickly. The nightly trips were different as everyone was more relaxed and talkative. The girls often sang songs for most of that hour, Henry the 8th I Am was a favorite and most of us boys would groan as they started up yet another round of Henry over and over and ...well. Nevermind. You get the drift. My sister, who was 18 months younger, and her friend Cheryl often led the singing which I would try to ignore except to look up to catch a peek at her best friend sitting with her. Someone I had a crush on for 3 years and never once did I ever let on how I felt. (still hurts a bit sometimes).

The weather often made the trips even more treacherous with mud and snow and we seldom missed a day of school too. It usually took an ice storm to keep us home from school. We boys did have some fun usually towards the end of the run as the bus emptied out we'd sit in the furthest back seats and then slide into the aisle where we'd stand and ""surf"" the bus and its wilding changing angles over hills and bumps. Sometimes we'd catch the driver watching us but he usually didn't say anything when we did it. My friend Tim (Chanay) and I talked about joining the air force and becoming fighter pilots one day. His dad flew crop dusters out of the Vinland Aerodrome.

While it could get exciting moving over into the overhanging tree limbs at breakneck speed at times for the most part we were never really in any danger except one day, one very cold and icy day a broken limb off a tree (apparently had broke due to the ice on the three and was just sitting on top of other branches while it waited for us to pass buy. A pickup truck forced the driver over and with a crash, that limb came through the front windshield and penetrated the bus at least 10 feet back into the seating area. It came within a foot of a little girl sitting ahead of us. Luckily, no one was seriously hurt as the bus was half empty at the time.

The only other thing that I remember happening was when a senior from the high school, one of the few that ever rode the bus, thought it funny to pull the cord on my jacket after he apparently looped it around my neck tight. I immediately started choking and my vision went black until the next thing I remember the driver was dragging the kid off the bus by the arm and escorted him off where he left him standing. We quickly came to another immediate stop as the driver lept off the bus and went running back towards the kid (who fully matched the driver in height) and started yelling at him. The kid had thrown a rock at the bus as we started to leave and that college kid wasted no time dealing with him. 

Besides those two incidents, it was just endless hills and bumps and roller coaster drops as we'd run over rattlesnakes crossing the road or rabbits and dogs dodging the bus as we passed by endless farmland nestled into surrounding timber forests. This went on for 3 years until I started going into Baldwin my ninth grade year for high school and not long after I started riding with friends in their cars and pickups into school. One was named Allan who had his 46 ford pickup he was so proud of. A truck without a working starter so he'd always park so we could push it and get it started by popping the clutch to get the engine going.

We moved away after my sophomore year and to this day I miss that school at Vinland and the new high school in Baldwin that opened my freshman year. That was the first school I ever experienced air conditioning since we never had it at home and in school until then.

I am starting to suspect some people might have been told they were getting a cold climate model from their HVAC installer when they actually cheapened out and put in one not made for our climate and pocketed the money. That or HVAC installers are assuming a heat pump is a heat pump. 

There is videos of people in Canada using them, Norway uses a ton of them. What do you think is more likely these people don't have heating that works below 32F, OR maybe your HVAC installer fucked up and didn't get the correct models. 

If you do want to get a heat pump ask your installer for the spec sheet and what temperatures it is rated for, I wouldn't put in anything that does not work at least 80% performance at -5F and really think the ones like the Mr Cool, and Mitsubishi units that keep that into the -20F would perform in all conditions here in Kansas and those wouldn't even need aux heating.",2023-03-02 03:30:31+00:00

128,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, dislike",Riding the school bus to Vinland Kansas in the '60's,"We moved from Baldwin Kansas sometime during 1965 to a very rural area a few miles outside Vinland and it was culture shock right away. We'd always lived in small towns, Olathe, Gardner (twice), and then Baldwin and while I wasn't a big fan of school I did like living in Baldwin. It had everything you needed. A theater, college kids going to Baker, and actual college dorms scattered around town. During that summer I played in little league (Cardinals) and actually had to try out in those days to make the team. But then my world took a hit when we moved to a small 1/2 acre cut into the hillside. I can still see that red dirt and taste that rusty well water.   

Then came school at Vinland junior high for the 6th grade (we had junior high for 6, 7, and 8 there). The school was ancient but they had added on a more modern building for grades 1-5 and that part still lives I believe while the old building is gone. And I don't believe it's a school anymore. As it turned out life was even better for a kid there as we had 13 kids in our class and everyone was friendly. But the downside was riding the bus 2 hours a day, an hour in the morning, and an hour at night mainly because we were first on in the morning and last off at night.

If you have ever ridden on a bus on country roads it's like riding a rollercoaster up and down the rolling hills of eastern Kansas complete with enough ruts, bumps, and drops to shake your brain loose. I spent most of my time trying to read science fiction books while dealing with motion sickness but in the end, my need to read got me past the sick stomach. That two hours a day was a life in itself as we wound our way through tree-covered narrow gravel country roads where we often clipped through overhanging branches if we had to make room for a passing car, tractor, or combine on its way to a field somewhere. 

And it wasn't a slow trip as those bus drivers (often college students) drove like the wind ""bullseye"". We got tossed all over, bounce up and down constantly the entire trip, and since there were no seat belts you could if you were careful end up in the aisle and on your backside often with the driver's face in his large mirror looking back at us with a grin on his face.

Sometimes the gravel dust would come in through the always-open windows and try to choke us all to death when vehicles passed by. The only break we go was when the bus stopped to drop or pick someone up. So you had to catch your breath quickly. The nightly trips were different as everyone was more relaxed and talkative. The girls often sang songs for most of that hour, Henry the 8th I Am was a favorite and most of us boys would groan as they started up yet another round of Henry over and over and ...well. Nevermind. You get the drift. My sister, who was 18 months younger, and her friend Cheryl often led the singing which I would try to ignore except to look up to catch a peek at her best friend sitting with her. Someone I had a crush on for 3 years and never once did I ever let on how I felt. (still hurts a bit sometimes).

The weather often made the trips even more treacherous with mud and snow and we seldom missed a day of school too. It usually took an ice storm to keep us home from school. We boys did have some fun usually towards the end of the run as the bus emptied out we'd sit in the furthest back seats and then slide into the aisle where we'd stand and ""surf"" the bus and its wilding changing angles over hills and bumps. Sometimes we'd catch the driver watching us but he usually didn't say anything when we did it. My friend Tim (Chanay) and I talked about joining the air force and becoming fighter pilots one day. His dad flew crop dusters out of the Vinland Aerodrome.

While it could get exciting moving over into the overhanging tree limbs at breakneck speed at times for the most part we were never really in any danger except one day, one very cold and icy day a broken limb off a tree (apparently had broke due to the ice on the three and was just sitting on top of other branches while it waited for us to pass buy. A pickup truck forced the driver over and with a crash, that limb came through the front windshield and penetrated the bus at least 10 feet back into the seating area. It came within a foot of a little girl sitting ahead of us. Luckily, no one was seriously hurt as the bus was half empty at the time.

The only other thing that I remember happening was when a senior from the high school, one of the few that ever rode the bus, thought it funny to pull the cord on my jacket after he apparently looped it around my neck tight. I immediately started choking and my vision went black until the next thing I remember the driver was dragging the kid off the bus by the arm and escorted him off where he left him standing. We quickly came to another immediate stop as the driver lept off the bus and went running back towards the kid (who fully matched the driver in height) and started yelling at him. The kid had thrown a rock at the bus as we started to leave and that college kid wasted no time dealing with him. 

Besides those two incidents, it was just endless hills and bumps and roller coaster drops as we'd run over rattlesnakes crossing the road or rabbits and dogs dodging the bus as we passed by endless farmland nestled into surrounding timber forests. This went on for 3 years until I started going into Baldwin my ninth grade year for high school and not long after I started riding with friends in their cars and pickups into school. One was named Allan who had his 46 ford pickup he was so proud of. A truck without a working starter so he'd always park so we could push it and get it started by popping the clutch to get the engine going.

We moved away after my sophomore year and to this day I miss that school at Vinland and the new high school in Baldwin that opened my freshman year. That was the first school I ever experienced air conditioning since we never had it at home and in school until then.

If you are replacing your AC unit this summer or in the next few year I would highly suggest you look into getting a model that also functions as a heat pump(a cold climate one) installed, and just rip out your furnace. 

I ran the numbers for where I currently live and I estimated a heat pump is going to run about half of what last years heating cost in gas ran and that is with a high efficiency furnace. 

I plan in the next 5 years to remove all gas appliances from my home to save money. There is subsidies available to make it even more cheap. Heat pumps are cheaper then installing both an AC and Furnace, but will be more expensive then just an cheap AC unit, but given they can be more efficient then basic AC units at cooling so it can save money in the summer. 




I know what all the first responses are going to be 

>""Heat pumps don't work in the cold"" 

This is wrong, older older units loose performance in colder temperatures, but modern ones have no issues running well into the negatives here is someone having a Mitsubishi running just fine at -25F windchill.

Mitsubishi is selling heatpumps in Canada that run at 90% at -13F. 

You should be getting around 80% BTU output at -20F, Kansas is not all that cold its going to be running very efficiency 99% of the time, I don't plan to keep any kind of backup heating I don't think it is needed. Looking at the temperature records here in Manhattan, there only has been 4 temperature records below -22F, -18F was in 2021 in that freeze the heat pump certainly would have been running less efficiently, but still working. Obviously we aren't the colder part of Kansas, but something to keep in mind. 

Most models that are cold climate heat are also very efficient AC units the Mr Cool unit has double the SEER rating of the one i currently use so there would be savings during the summer as well. The DOE has also been doing funding for more domestic cold weather heatpumps and trying to push their temperatures further, so by the time your replacing things in a few years they could be even better. 

The benefits extend beyond saving you money, if your furnace is your only gas appliance you can eliminate the risk of Carbon Monoxide in your home or an explosive gas leak. 

Not to say there won't be issues, you are going to have to deal with making sure snow does not bury it, but this can mean just getting it up more off the ground, it won't be free, you will see an increase in your electric bill. 


In an extremely poorly built home it might not have the raw BTUs to keep up that a large gas furnace can output, so you may want to improve that with air sealing in your attic, adding insulation that is ideally not fiberglass, upgrading windows ect.

The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives every thing its value.”

Tuesday was a powerful loss. Most of us have read his agenda 47, the Republican platform, and of course, the mandate for leadership. We know what’s coming. We know what he is going to try and do. And yes, it is formidable and it is scary. I am worried for my family. I am worried for what the future holds for me. And I’m worried for what the future looks like for the country.

I am tired and I am exhausted. I am tired of fighting for the right to exist. I am tired of fighting for the right to feel safe. I am tired of marginalized people in this country being the scapegoat. I am tired of the rights supposedly endowed by our creator to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness only applying to those as white and straight as the lined paper on the other side of the red lined margin. 

But, tired or not, I will fight. I will stand. For my spirit may be battered, but it is far from broken. My muscles may ache, but they are still strong. And my voice may be hoarse, but it is still powerful. I have shed my tears and cried my lament. I have spent time crumpled down in prayer and quiet anguish. Now it’s time to stand again. It’s time to dust myself off, and re-establish the chain forged in anger, sadness, and blessed sisterhood. The future is not set in stone. And the salt water that ruins their cement is more effective if it comes from our sweat, than if it comes from our tears.

We have two years to identify candidates, to campaign, and prepare to remove the teeth from the bumble. We must not look so far away as four years when the midterms are in 2026. We must start NOW to strategize and prepare to paint the house and senate in D.C, and in our states, blue. 

I gave too much of my energy, and my health to serve this country in order to just let it end like this. I am neither prepared to give up hope, nor ready to give up the fight. The future of our country lay ahead of us. And our legacy is born in moments like this. 

Let us fight…let us fight, like our lives and the lives of all of our siblings are on the line…like our very freedom to fight is what is at stake.

The weather often made the trips even more treacherous with mud and snow and we seldom missed a day of school too. It usually took an ice storm to keep us home from school. We boys did have some fun usually towards the end of the run as the bus emptied out we'd sit in the furthest back seats and then slide into the aisle where we'd stand and ""surf"" the bus and its wilding changing angles over hills and bumps. Sometimes we'd catch the driver watching us but he usually didn't say anything when we did it. My friend Tim (Chanay) and I talked about joining the air force and becoming fighter pilots one day. His dad flew crop dusters out of the Vinland Aerodrome.

While it could get exciting moving over into the overhanging tree limbs at breakneck speed at times for the most part we were never really in any danger except one day, one very cold and icy day a broken limb off a tree (apparently had broke due to the ice on the three and was just sitting on top of other branches while it waited for us to pass buy. A pickup truck forced the driver over and with a crash, that limb came through the front windshield and penetrated the bus at least 10 feet back into the seating area. It came within a foot of a little girl sitting ahead of us. Luckily, no one was seriously hurt as the bus was half empty at the time.

The only other thing that I remember happening was when a senior from the high school, one of the few that ever rode the bus, thought it funny to pull the cord on my jacket after he apparently looped it around my neck tight. I immediately started choking and my vision went black until the next thing I remember the driver was dragging the kid off the bus by the arm and escorted him off where he left him standing. We quickly came to another immediate stop as the driver lept off the bus and went running back towards the kid (who fully matched the driver in height) and started yelling at him. The kid had thrown a rock at the bus as we started to leave and that college kid wasted no time dealing with him. 

Besides those two incidents, it was just endless hills and bumps and roller coaster drops as we'd run over rattlesnakes crossing the road or rabbits and dogs dodging the bus as we passed by endless farmland nestled into surrounding timber forests. This went on for 3 years until I started going into Baldwin my ninth grade year for high school and not long after I started riding with friends in their cars and pickups into school. One was named Allan who had his 46 ford pickup he was so proud of. A truck without a working starter so he'd always park so we could push it and get it started by popping the clutch to get the engine going.

We moved away after my sophomore year and to this day I miss that school at Vinland and the new high school in Baldwin that opened my freshman year. That was the first school I ever experienced air conditioning since we never had it at home and in school until then.

If you are replacing your AC unit this summer or in the next few year I would highly suggest you look into getting a model that also functions as a heat pump(a cold climate one) installed, and just rip out your furnace. 

I ran the numbers for where I currently live and I estimated a heat pump is going to run about half of what last years heating cost in gas ran and that is with a high efficiency furnace. 

I plan in the next 5 years to remove all gas appliances from my home to save money. There is subsidies available to make it even more cheap. Heat pumps are cheaper then installing both an AC and Furnace, but will be more expensive then just an cheap AC unit, but given they can be more efficient then basic AC units at cooling so it can save money in the summer. 




I know what all the first responses are going to be 

>""Heat pumps don't work in the cold"" 

This is wrong, older older units loose performance in colder temperatures, but modern ones have no issues running well into the negatives here is someone having a Mitsubishi running just fine at -25F windchill.

Mr Cool Universal Series which is what I plan to probably install myself as there is one downside most installers say they won't work with air source heatpumps.

Mitsubishi is selling heatpumps in Canada that run at 90% at -13F. 

You should be getting around 80% BTU output at -20F, Kansas is not all that cold its going to be running very efficiency 99% of the time, I don't plan to keep any kind of backup heating I don't think it is needed. Looking at the temperature records here in Manhattan, there only has been 4 temperature records below -22F, -18F was in 2021 in that freeze the heat pump certainly would have been running less efficiently, but still working. Obviously we aren't the colder part of Kansas, but something to keep in mind. 

Most models that are cold climate heat are also very efficient AC units the Mr Cool unit has double the SEER rating of the one i currently use so there would be savings during the summer as well. The DOE has also been doing funding for more domestic cold weather heatpumps and trying to push their temperatures further, so by the time your replacing things in a few years they could be even better. 

The benefits extend beyond saving you money, if your furnace is your only gas appliance you can eliminate the risk of Carbon Monoxide in your home or an explosive gas leak. 

Not to say there won't be issues, you are going to have to deal with making sure snow does not bury it, but this can mean just getting it up more off the ground, it won't be free, you will see an increase in your electric bill. 


In an extremely poorly built home it might not have the raw BTUs to keep up that a large gas furnace can output, so you may want to improve that with air sealing in your attic, adding insulation that is ideally not fiberglass, upgrading windows ect. 



This is a pretty good video on heat pumps

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43XKfuptnik


Edit:

Someone is also going to argue that electricity won't be heating when the power is out, guess what neither will your furnace be blowing hot air when the electricity is out even if its gas due to electric ignition and blower that all run on electricity.

Edit Edit:

I am starting to suspect some people might have been told they were getting a cold climate model from their HVAC installer when they actually cheapened out and put in one not made for our climate and pocketed the money. That or HVAC installers are assuming a heat pump is a heat pump. 

There is videos of people in Canada using them, Norway uses a ton of them. What do you think is more likely these people don't have heating that works below 32F, OR maybe your HVAC installer fucked up and didn't get the correct models. 

If you do want to get a heat pump ask your installer for the spec sheet and what temperatures it is rated for, I wouldn't put in anything that does not work at least 80% performance at -5F and really think the ones like the Mr Cool, and Mitsubishi units that keep that into the -20F would perform in all conditions here in Kansas and those wouldn't even need aux heating.",2023-03-02 03:30:31+00:00

154,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, annoyed",Riding the school bus to Vinland Kansas in the '60's,"We moved from Baldwin Kansas sometime during 1965 to a very rural area a few miles outside Vinland and it was culture shock right away. We'd always lived in small towns, Olathe, Gardner (twice), and then Baldwin and while I wasn't a big fan of school I did like living in Baldwin. It had everything you needed. A theater, college kids going to Baker, and actual college dorms scattered around town. During that summer I played in little league (Cardinals) and actually had to try out in those days to make the team. But then my world took a hit when we moved to a small 1/2 acre cut into the hillside. I can still see that red dirt and taste that rusty well water.   

Then came school at Vinland junior high for the 6th grade (we had junior high for 6, 7, and 8 there). The school was ancient but they had added on a more modern building for grades 1-5 and that part still lives I believe while the old building is gone. And I don't believe it's a school anymore. As it turned out life was even better for a kid there as we had 13 kids in our class and everyone was friendly. But the downside was riding the bus 2 hours a day, an hour in the morning, and an hour at night mainly because we were first on in the morning and last off at night.

If you have ever ridden on a bus on country roads it's like riding a rollercoaster up and down the rolling hills of eastern Kansas complete with enough ruts, bumps, and drops to shake your brain loose. I spent most of my time trying to read science fiction books while dealing with motion sickness but in the end, my need to read got me past the sick stomach. That two hours a day was a life in itself as we wound our way through tree-covered narrow gravel country roads where we often clipped through overhanging branches if we had to make room for a passing car, tractor, or combine on its way to a field somewhere. 

And it wasn't a slow trip as those bus drivers (often college students) drove like the wind ""bullseye"". We got tossed all over, bounce up and down constantly the entire trip, and since there were no seat belts you could if you were careful end up in the aisle and on your backside often with the driver's face in his large mirror looking back at us with a grin on his face.

Sometimes the gravel dust would come in through the always-open windows and try to choke us all to death when vehicles passed by. The only break we go was when the bus stopped to drop or pick someone up. So you had to catch your breath quickly. The nightly trips were different as everyone was more relaxed and talkative. The girls often sang songs for most of that hour, Henry the 8th I Am was a favorite and most of us boys would groan as they started up yet another round of Henry over and over and ...well. Nevermind. You get the drift. My sister, who was 18 months younger, and her friend Cheryl often led the singing which I would try to ignore except to look up to catch a peek at her best friend sitting with her. Someone I had a crush on for 3 years and never once did I ever let on how I felt. (still hurts a bit sometimes).

The weather often made the trips even more treacherous with mud and snow and we seldom missed a day of school too. It usually took an ice storm to keep us home from school. We boys did have some fun usually towards the end of the run as the bus emptied out we'd sit in the furthest back seats and then slide into the aisle where we'd stand and ""surf"" the bus and its wilding changing angles over hills and bumps. Sometimes we'd catch the driver watching us but he usually didn't say anything when we did it. My friend Tim (Chanay) and I talked about joining the air force and becoming fighter pilots one day. His dad flew crop dusters out of the Vinland Aerodrome.

It came within a foot of a little girl sitting ahead of us. Luckily, no one was seriously hurt as the bus was half empty at the time.

The only other thing that I remember happening was when a senior from the high school, one of the few that ever rode the bus, thought it funny to pull the cord on my jacket after he apparently looped it around my neck tight. I immediately started choking and my vision went black until the next thing I remember the driver was dragging the kid off the bus by the arm and escorted him off where he left him standing. We quickly came to another immediate stop as the driver lept off the bus and went running back towards the kid (who fully matched the driver in height) and started yelling at him. The kid had thrown a rock at the bus as we started to leave and that college kid wasted no time dealing with him. 

Besides those two incidents, it was just endless hills and bumps and roller coaster drops as we'd run over rattlesnakes crossing the road or rabbits and dogs dodging the bus as we passed by endless farmland nestled into surrounding timber forests. This went on for 3 years until I started going into Baldwin my ninth grade year for high school and not long after I started riding with friends in their cars and pickups into school. One was named Allan who had his 46 ford pickup he was so proud of.

167,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, love",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

171,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, love",Kansas the Time to Ditch Gas and Switch to Heat Pumps Is Now,"There have been more posts and many people are talk just about how expensive gas heating has been getting here this year. If you are replacing your AC unit this summer or in the next few year I would highly suggest you look into getting a model that also functions as a heat pump(a cold climate one) installed, and just rip out your furnace. 

I ran the numbers for where I currently live and I estimated a heat pump is going to run about half of what last years heating cost in gas ran and that is with a high efficiency furnace. 

I plan in the next 5 years to remove all gas appliances from my home to save money. There is subsidies available to make it even more cheap. Heat pumps are cheaper then installing both an AC and Furnace, but will be more expensive then just an cheap AC unit, but given they can be more efficient then basic AC units at cooling so it can save money in the summer. 




I know what all the first responses are going to be 

>""Heat pumps don't work in the cold"" 

This is wrong, older older units loose performance in colder temperatures, but modern ones have no issues running well into the negatives here is someone having a Mitsubishi running just fine at -25F windchill.

https://mrcool.com/mrcool-universal-series-dc-inverter-heat-pump-air-conditioner-split-system/

Mitsubishi is selling heatpumps in Canada that run at 90% at -13F. 

You should be getting around 80% BTU output at -20F, Kansas is not all that cold its going to be running very efficiency 99% of the time, I don't plan to keep any kind of backup heating I don't think it is needed. Looking at the temperature records here in Manhattan, there only has been 4 temperature records below -22F, -18F was in 2021 in that freeze the heat pump certainly would have been running less efficiently, but still working. Obviously we aren't the colder part of Kansas, but something to keep in mind. 

Most models that are cold climate heat are also very efficient AC units the Mr Cool unit has double the SEER rating of the one i currently use so there would be savings during the summer as well. The DOE has also been doing funding for more domestic cold weather heatpumps and trying to push their temperatures further, so by the time your replacing things in a few years they could be even better. 

The benefits extend beyond saving you money, if your furnace is your only gas appliance you can eliminate the risk of Carbon Monoxide in your home or an explosive gas leak. 

Not to say there won't be issues, you are going to have to deal with making sure snow does not bury it, but this can mean just getting it up more off the ground, it won't be free, you will see an increase in your electric bill. 


In an extremely poorly built home it might not have the raw BTUs to keep up that a large gas furnace can output, so you may want to improve that with air sealing in your attic, adding insulation that is ideally not fiberglass, upgrading windows ect. 



This is a pretty good video on heat pumps

Technology Connections:  Heat Pumps are Not Hard: Here's what it will take to start pumping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43XKfuptnik


Edit:

Someone is also going to argue that electricity won't be heating when the power is out, guess what neither will your furnace be blowing hot air when the electricity is out even if its gas due to electric ignition and blower that all run on electricity.

Edit Edit:

I am starting to suspect some people might have been told they were getting a cold climate model from their HVAC installer when they actually cheapened out and put in one not made for our climate and pocketed the money. That or HVAC installers are assuming a heat pump is a heat pump. 

There is videos of people in Canada using them, Norway uses a ton of them. What do you think is more likely these people don't have heating that works below 32F, OR maybe your HVAC installer fucked up and didn't get the correct models. 

If you do want to get a heat pump ask your installer for the spec sheet and what temperatures it is rated for, I wouldn't put in anything that does not work at least 80% performance at -5F and really think the ones like the Mr Cool, and Mitsubishi units that keep that into the -20F would perform in all conditions here in Kansas and those wouldn't even need aux heating.",2023-03-02 03:30:31+00:00

173,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, love",Day 7-10 Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America)," 

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

179,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

180,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00
181,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, enjoy",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

183,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, enjoy",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00

185,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, enjoy",Kansas the Time to Ditch Gas and Switch to Heat Pumps Is Now,"There have been more posts and many people are talk just about how expensive gas heating has been getting here this year. If you are replacing your AC unit this summer or in the next few year I would highly suggest you look into getting a model that also functions as a heat pump(a cold climate one) installed, and just rip out your furnace. 

I ran the numbers for where I currently live and I estimated a heat pump is going to run about half of what last years heating cost in gas ran and that is with a high efficiency furnace. 

I plan in the next 5 years to remove all gas appliances from my home to save money. There is subsidies available to make it even more cheap. Heat pumps are cheaper then installing both an AC and Furnace, but will be more expensive then just an cheap AC unit, but given they can be more efficient then basic AC units at cooling so it can save money in the summer.

This is wrong, older older units loose performance in colder temperatures, but modern ones have no issues running well into the negatives here is someone having a Mitsubishi running just fine at -25F windchill.

Mitsubishi is selling heatpumps in Canada that run at 90% at -13F. 

You should be getting around 80% BTU output at -20F, Kansas is not all that cold its going to be running very efficiency 99% of the time, I don't plan to keep any kind of backup heating I don't think it is needed. Looking at the temperature records here in Manhattan, there only has been 4 temperature records below -22F, -18F was in 2021 in that freeze the heat pump certainly would have been running less efficiently, but still working. Obviously we aren't the colder part of Kansas, but something to keep in mind. 

Most models that are cold climate heat are also very efficient AC units the Mr Cool unit has double the SEER rating of the one i currently use so there would be savings during the summer as well. The DOE has also been doing funding for more domestic cold weather heatpumps and trying to push their temperatures further, so by the time your replacing things in a few years they could be even better. 

The benefits extend beyond saving you money, if your furnace is your only gas appliance you can eliminate the risk of Carbon Monoxide in your home or an explosive gas leak. 

Not to say there won't be issues, you are going to have to deal with making sure snow does not bury it, but this can mean just getting it up more off the ground, it won't be free, you will see an increase in your electric bill. 


In an extremely poorly built home it might not have the raw BTUs to keep up that a large gas furnace can output, so you may want to improve that with air sealing in your attic, adding insulation that is ideally not fiberglass, upgrading windows ect. 



This is a pretty good video on heat pumps

Technology Connections:  Heat Pumps are Not Hard: Here's what it will take to start pumping
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43XKfuptnik


Edit:

Someone is also going to argue that electricity won't be heating when the power is out, guess what neither will your furnace be blowing hot air when the electricity is out even if its gas due to electric ignition and blower that all run on electricity.

Edit Edit:

I am starting to suspect some people might have been told they were getting a cold climate model from their HVAC installer when they actually cheapened out and put in one not made for our climate and pocketed the money. That or HVAC installers are assuming a heat pump is a heat pump. 

There is videos of people in Canada using them, Norway uses a ton of them. What do you think is more likely these people don't have heating that works below 32F, OR maybe your HVAC installer fucked up and didn't get the correct models. 

If you do want to get a heat pump ask your installer for the spec sheet and what temperatures it is rated for, I wouldn't put in anything that does not work at least 80% performance at -5F and really think the ones like the Mr Cool, and Mitsubishi units that keep that into the -20F would perform in all conditions here in Kansas and those wouldn't even need aux heating.",2023-03-02 03:30:31+00:00
186,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, heat, enjoy",Day 7-10 Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America)," 

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

Most models that are cold climate heat are also very efficient AC units the Mr Cool unit has double the SEER rating of the one i currently use so there would be savings during the summer as well. The DOE has also been doing funding for more domestic cold weather heatpumps and trying to push their temperatures further, so by the time your replacing things in a few years they could be even better. 

The benefits extend beyond saving you money, if your furnace is your only gas appliance you can eliminate the risk of Carbon Monoxide in your home or an explosive gas leak. 

Not to say there won't be issues, you are going to have to deal with making sure snow does not bury it, but this can mean just getting it up more off the ground, it won't be free, you will see an increase in your electric bill. 


In an extremely poorly built home it might not have the raw BTUs to keep up that a large gas furnace can output, so you may want to improve that with air sealing in your attic, adding insulation that is ideally not fiberglass, upgrading windows ect.

Someone is also going to argue that electricity won't be heating when the power is out, guess what neither will your furnace be blowing hot air when the electricity is out even if its gas due to electric ignition and blower that all run on electricity.

Edit Edit:

I am starting to suspect some people might have been told they were getting a cold climate model from their HVAC installer when they actually cheapened out and put in one not made for our climate and pocketed the money. That or HVAC installers are assuming a heat pump is a heat pump. 

There is videos of people in Canada using them, Norway uses a ton of them. What do you think is more likely these people don't have heating that works below 32F, OR maybe your HVAC installer fucked up and didn't get the correct models. 

If you do want to get a heat pump ask your installer for the spec sheet and what temperatures it is rated for, I wouldn't put in anything that does not work at least 80% performance at -5F and really think the ones like the Mr Cool, and Mitsubishi units that keep that into the -20F would perform in all conditions here in Kansas and those wouldn't even need aux heating.",2023-03-02 03:30:31+00:00

203,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, love",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

211,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

212,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00
213,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, enjoy",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again.

216,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunlight, enjoy",Day 7-10 Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America)," 

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

I wouldn’t have felt bad paying $50 for that show. They said over the intercom that they were trying to make this a regular event at Forbes Field. They want to become the premier nighttime airshow. It’s insane that they were flying such close formations at night. With nothing but position lights for reference where the other aircraft is. This show was spectacular!

A bit ago I saved some cats from starving to death and have been fruitlessly trying, and failing, to manage to find them shelter, foster, or rehoming placement, enough for all of them. I've made two prior posts to the local sub [here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wichita/comments/1g1ly4d/urgent_rehoming_needed_abandoned_cats_and_kittens/)and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wichita/comments/1g6squh/urgent_rehoming_still_needed_abandoned_cats_and/), and have made many attempts to post on facebook with a lot of constant rejections spam filtering etc due to my account age. I've called every single place I can find in the state with no help either, so at this point it's either they have rehoming or nothing. I'm out of time and options they need to go somewhere ASAP.

I will drive anywhere in the state, even all the way to neighboring states, but I've still not found any takers. I hope this is ok I found similar posts and they're still up.

Remaining cats are Princess (adult female mother), 2 female kittens (lucy, bandit), and 1 male (hobbes). All litterbox trained, have been treated for fleas again recently with frontline, and they're not feral or hostile just skittish and will need some patience. Princess is completely tame and loves people, but her remaining kittens still need some time and warming up to people.

246,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, love",Day 7-10 Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America)," 

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

Demi was cold and scared but after a few hours of building trust, we got her inside, fed and warm. She has been “borrowing” our puppy’s kennel for now. This morning I took her to the groomers and she had her (way overgrown) nails done and got a nice bath. She’s looking good!

I used to volunteer with the Humane Society, so I’ve already reached out to some local organizations. That said, I am taking a shot at finding her a new home on my own.

If anyone is interested in giving this sweet little girl a new home, please reach out. I can tell you that she is very calm/sleepy, but she still has a little spunk (she tried to jump clear up in my jeep, lol!), she gets along fine with my dogs, and she loves hanging in a kennel when I can’t watch her actively. Only con I see in her is she could probably stand to lose a few pounds, especially after the treats I’ve given her.

251,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, hate",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too.

258,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

259,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00
260,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, enjoy",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00

262,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, enjoy",Day 7-10 Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America)," 

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

&#x200B;

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

267,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, dislike",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that.

The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives every thing its value.”

Tuesday was a powerful loss. Most of us have read his agenda 47, the Republican platform, and of course, the mandate for leadership. We know what’s coming. We know what he is going to try and do. And yes, it is formidable and it is scary. I am worried for my family. I am worried for what the future holds for me. And I’m worried for what the future looks like for the country.

I am tired and I am exhausted. I am tired of fighting for the right to exist. I am tired of fighting for the right to feel safe. I am tired of marginalized people in this country being the scapegoat. I am tired of the rights supposedly endowed by our creator to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness only applying to those as white and straight as the lined paper on the other side of the red lined margin. 

But, tired or not, I will fight. I will stand. For my spirit may be battered, but it is far from broken. My muscles may ache, but they are still strong. And my voice may be hoarse, but it is still powerful. I have shed my tears and cried my lament. I have spent time crumpled down in prayer and quiet anguish. Now it’s time to stand again. It’s time to dust myself off, and re-establish the chain forged in anger, sadness, and blessed sisterhood. The future is not set in stone. And the salt water that ruins their cement is more effective if it comes from our sweat, than if it comes from our tears.

We have two years to identify candidates, to campaign, and prepare to remove the teeth from the bumble. We must not look so far away as four years when the midterms are in 2026. We must start NOW to strategize and prepare to paint the house and senate in D.C, and in our states, blue. 

I gave too much of my energy, and my health to serve this country in order to just let it end like this. I am neither prepared to give up hope, nor ready to give up the fight. The future of our country lay ahead of us. And our legacy is born in moments like this. 

Let us fight…let us fight, like our lives and the lives of all of our siblings are on the line…like our very freedom to fight is what is at stake. Because in all truth, all hyperbole aside, it truly is. Our opportunity on Tuesday was lost, but our opportunity today has only just begun.",2024-11-07 17:12:32+00:00

297,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, love",Day 7-10 Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America)," 

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

**Pickup trucks are more dangerous to me than 18 wheelers (also please put your phone down while driving):** A lot of people have been warning me that because of the harvest that I need to watch out for the 18 wheelers. But I have been seeing the 18 wheelers since getting into Kansas and I try to remind these people that the pickup trucks are much scarier. If a pickup truck or an 18 wheeler happens to hit me (something I think about constantly), I am going to be flattened. The difference is that you will never see an 18 wheeler on their phone. In fact 18 wheelers often get over to the entire other lane for me or slow down when that is not possible and then give me a wave. Whereas, I can tell when someone is on their phone based on the way they are driving much sooner than I can see them or their phone. Just yesterday there were multiple close calls with people on their phones. I understand that there are nice and responsible drivers who operate pickup trucks, but the overwhelming majority of my close calls involve oversized pickup trucks. 

People need to understand that when you are driving 65+ miles an hour in a huge hunk of metal that you are operating a potential weapon. The sad reality is that me or anyone else's finger wagging is not going to stop people from using their phones while driving. So long as cell phones play a huge role in people’s lives there will always be crashes stemming from distracted driving. If auto manufacturers wanted to engineer a way that would make it impossible to operate your car unless you relinquished use of your phone for the duration of your drive, they most certainly could. For most of the lifespan of cars, cell phones were not an issue and people still got where they needed to and still listened to music. But where is the profit in making that a reality? And if it don’t make dollars then it don’t make sense. 

This is something I am incredibly passionate about as my life is on the line everyday. And my life isn’t just on the line on US-36, it is also on the line in cities where around 83% of Americans live. It is also not only me as about a quarter of Americans can’t drive whether they are too young, too old, disabled, or for whatever other reasons. Additionally, it’s also not just people outside of cars as distracted drivers injure and kill other drivers too. Issues like distracted driving require us to think systemically. No amount of finger waving, public service announcements, or blaming individuals is going to fix the issue. But finding innovative solutions such as new safety features in cars and redesigning a transportation system with human error in mind will help us overcome the problem. 

Like I always say, “the advocacy is built into the activity.” I understand that walking across America is dangerous, but that doesn't mean I can’t advocate for things I believe would make the journey safer. That is why I have been raising money for AmericaWalks. They are the only national pedestrian advocacy organization and they do great work in trying to reduce pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as traffic injuries and fatalities in general. I always appreciate when people hope that I stay safe, but if you want to help with that mission, please consider either donating to AmericaWalks or by getting involved in your local communities to make them safer for all road users.

Those are plenty of words for now, maybe I just need to keep walking or else all of the thoughts from my lonely miles will appear lol. But once again I am really enjoying Kansas and all the lovely people I am meeting. I am over halfway to St. Joseph and should be halfway through Kansas tomorrow. As always the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.

300,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, enjoy",Day 4-6 walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy y’all,

So I’ve made it from McDonald, KS to Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS. I have definitely been covering some good distance and it is probably for the best since the weather is beginning to change, this morning was the first at around freezing since March, so this boy is a moving and a shaking to head East and then South.

I thought I’d share some highlights and thoughts from the last couple of days in no specific order. 

Campgrounds: One of the biggest surprises for me has been the abundance of free public campgrounds along 36. As long as I make it to a town I have reliable spot to sleep, which has been the case every night so far. Public land was much more readily available in the Western states I traversed, so I was a tad worried for Kansas, but the campgrounds have been such a blessing. I’m currently at Prairie Dog State Park and a fun fact about the park is that Prairie Dogs didn’t actually live here until the 1980s even though the park was started in 1967.

Trucks getting over: I walk by lots of big trucks and 18 wheelers along my journey. Maybe surprisingly to some, but 18 wheeler drivers are probably the most courteous to me, in Kansas especially. They will either slow down or get over to the complete other lane for me which is really appreciated. I think I’ve probably seen the same drivers multiple times, but if they are reading this, thank you so much.

Corn: I think a lot of what the drivers are hauling is corn as I am seeing it everywhere. I expected to see plenty of it in the Midwest, but there still is just so much. One of the big things I was interested in learning about out West was water. But in Western KS I imagine a lot of this corn is being fed by the Ogallala Aquifer. I’d also imagine that this is a finite water supply, so is/are there any good journalism or resources to learn more about the aquifer and issues surrounding it? 

Oberlin: I really enjoyed the aesthetic of Oberlin with its brick roads, covered walkways, and historic buildings. Didn’t spend too much time there, but it was a cool place to check out and walk around for sure. 

County museums: When I was in Atwood I was able to go to the Rawlins county museum which every time I go to a town’s museum I always find out something interesting. For example Rawlins county is home to the guy who popularized Smokey Bear (apparently not Smokey the Bear). It is the longest running PSA in American history. Additionally there was a real life Smokey Bear that was rescued from a fire in New Mexico and brought to the National Zoo in DC. I had a great time talking to Lynette, who oversaw the museum, too. Don’t sleep on the little inconspicuous museums, you can always learn something there. 

Burrs, stickers, thorns: I wish I had known about these before coming to KS, because they have done a number on my tires. I was able to get some slime in Oberlin, but I am looking forward to the day when they aren’t a problem. Anyone know where they stop being an issue East of here? 

Tanner’s dad: Lastly on my 30+ mile day to Oberlin, a man pulls his car over a little bit in front of me and goes to his trunk to get something. As I approach the car the man is carrying two water bottles and offers them to me. We get to chatting and he tells me that he is Tanner’s dad, sweet guy from my first day in KS. I believe they are the Lacy’s and they are absolutely the sweetest family around. If you need some drywall work done in NW KS there is no one I’d recommend more highly than them.

This has probably run too long, but hope y’all enjoyed and it’s definitely better than not having anything to say about a place. I’ve really enjoyed my time in KS so far and have met so many friendly people already. Looking forward to much more.

301,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, enjoy",How is everything so cheap here? Wichita,"I’m in Wichita for business and I feel like I went back in time to the late 90s.

Everything is so cheap compared to California. Even restaurants are cheap. I can’t even get a mediocre sandwich where I live for less than $15.

I can see a lot of the town is not great but I’m confused as to how there can be such a massive difference in costs here vs California? A lot of houses are the prices of nice cars. 

I honestly feel like I’m in a time warp or a different country.

The weather is horrific here right now though. I would rather pay a crazy amount for a house and be able to enjoy the outdoors every day, so I’m guessing that’s a big part of it.",2023-08-25 22:34:23+00:00
302,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, enjoy",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00
303,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, enjoy",Day 3 Walking across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Not sure how frequently I will do these, but it seemed like in my last post people were interested in seeing what was happening along my journey. Yesterday seemed like a great day to highlight.

Started off the day from St Francis after a rest day and there was plenty of thunder to the West, but when I checked the radar I thought it would miss me (classic mistake).

I pretty much ran the whole way to Bird City with no rain up until that point. As soon as I got there a nice stranger named Alex saw me and came to hand me some water bottles. She was having to pretty much run after me because my walking speed was so fast lol. Very thankful for her.

The clouds were getting a little more ominous as I left Bird City, but the weather wasn’t saying any rain. So I kept walking until I felt some raindrops. Then the thunder started and there wasn’t really anywhere to take shelter. So I ended up sprinting to a dairy farm where i was able to shelter from the rain, lightning and hail in their office.

Once that cleared up, I set off again and thought the rain would be over for the day (wrong). I took some farm roads that had no traffic. I was heading to McDonald, KS when I checked the weather and it said I had 30 mins before the thunderstorm started up again. So we hauled ass through the corn fields to get to McDonald where I took shelter in a grocery store.

After that the rain was all done and I decided to pitch my tent at a rest stop off 36. It was here that maybe the most wild thing of the day happened. I called my grandparents in St Joseph to talk about a completely random matter and I mention to my pop pop that I was in McDonald. He then just casually mentions that my grandmother’s family had actually helped start the town back in the late 1800’s. Don’t think any of the family is still here, but this town that I had never heard of until yesterday was actually help started by my family and it was a complete coincidence that I called my grandparents on that exact day to learn that. Just wild to me.

Hope you all enjoyed reading this. I will probably make it to Atwood today so if anyone knows anyone there who could help me out give me a holler. Otherwise the best place to follow my journey through your great state is on IG at walk2washington.",2023-10-04 13:01:54+00:00
304,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, enjoy",Day 7-10 Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America)," 

Howdy y’all,

Last post I was leaving from Prairie Dog State Park just outside of Norton, KS and I am now in Smith Center, KS near the geographic center of the United States. I have been feeling a bit under the weather recently, not sure what, but I have been taking some nyquil and dayquil and been feeling a bit better. I decided to take a rest day today in Smith Center and got a motel last tonight and tonight. I usually don’t use hotels unless it makes sense and I got 2 nights for $19 (total) which definitely makes sense. Still meeting lots of friendly folks in Kansas and thought I’d share some takeaways from the past couple of days in no particular order of significance.

**I’ve really enjoyed the libraries in Kansas:** Earlier in the walk I was using libraries a lot more frequently to charge up my battery pack and use a computer. However, a lot of the libraries in small towns out West are not the most reliable or have the best hours. As I am typing this from the library in Smith Center, I am very thankful for the libraries I have gotten to use in Kansas. Plenty of very friendly and helpful librarians too. I can’t stress how awesome and important libraries are not just for me but so many others, don’t forget to use and support your local branch.

**Barn Quilts:** Thank you to all of those who reached out and helped explain barn quilts to me. I had been seeing a number of them, but was unsure of what they were. I have been really enjoying seeing them livening up towns and spaces everywhere I go. Funny enough I don’t think I have seen one on a barn yet.

**All of the towns along 36 are pretty similar:** I don’t mean that in a deriding way as every town has its own charm and character. It is just I feel as though I can guess what will be in a town before getting to the town, as the makeup of the towns are pretty similar. If the town is a county seat then along the part of 36 that runs through town there will probably be a Caseys, a subway, a pizza hut, a dollar general, a couple of gas stations, some mechanics and maybe a Tractor Supply company ( or something similar). Then the main street will run north/south a little way from 36 with some being a little more lively than others. Plenty of churches, a local grocer, county museum, a Mexican restaurant, the county courthouse, the library, city park and all of the other typical town components. My only frustration with the city design is that 36 turns from a two lane highway with a shoulder into a 4 lane road without a shoulder and no sidewalk once you enter a town. I’m usually able to get onto a connecting side street, but only after dealing with some hefty traffic.

Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives every thing its value.”

Tuesday was a powerful loss. Most of us have read his agenda 47, the Republican platform, and of course, the mandate for leadership. We know what’s coming. We know what he is going to try and do. And yes, it is formidable and it is scary. I am worried for my family. I am worried for what the future holds for me. And I’m worried for what the future looks like for the country.

I am tired and I am exhausted. I am tired of fighting for the right to exist. I am tired of fighting for the right to feel safe. I am tired of marginalized people in this country being the scapegoat. I am tired of the rights supposedly endowed by our creator to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness only applying to those as white and straight as the lined paper on the other side of the red lined margin. 

But, tired or not, I will fight. I will stand. For my spirit may be battered, but it is far from broken. My muscles may ache, but they are still strong. And my voice may be hoarse, but it is still powerful. I have shed my tears and cried my lament. I have spent time crumpled down in prayer and quiet anguish. Now it’s time to stand again. It’s time to dust myself off, and re-establish the chain forged in anger, sadness, and blessed sisterhood. The future is not set in stone. And the salt water that ruins their cement is more effective if it comes from our sweat, than if it comes from our tears.

We have two years to identify candidates, to campaign, and prepare to remove the teeth from the bumble. We must not look so far away as four years when the midterms are in 2026. We must start NOW to strategize and prepare to paint the house and senate in D.C, and in our states, blue. 

I gave too much of my energy, and my health to serve this country in order to just let it end like this. I am neither prepared to give up hope, nor ready to give up the fight. The future of our country lay ahead of us. And our legacy is born in moments like this. 

Let us fight…let us fight, like our lives and the lives of all of our siblings are on the line…like our very freedom to fight is what is at stake. Because in all truth, all hyperbole aside, it truly is. Our opportunity on Tuesday was lost, but our opportunity today has only just begun.",2024-11-07 17:12:32+00:00

Howdy y’all,

So I finished walking across Kansas on Wednesday after crossing into St. Joseph over the Missouri river. I did a little post for my last couple of days in Kansas but just wanted to do a little wrap up/thank you post for the entire experience. 

Something I always tell people is that America is more the people than the land and I really do believe Kansas is the embodiment of that. I can promise that the state is much more than farmland. From my very first steps in Kansas I met incredible friendly people such as Tanner, who brought me lunch and welcomed me into the home he built. I received kindness until the very last full day in Kansas where I was graciously hosted for lunch by Kristin and Vineet and then hosted for the evening by Jennifer and Jason. In between, I met so many friendly and wonderful people who were supportive and encouraging of my journey. 

Prior to getting to the state, I really didn’t know what to expect, except thinking that I would be on US-36 for the majority of the walk. However the walk became pretty predictable. I would get up around 7:30 after having spent the night in a campground/city park. I always start my day with some food, a little stretching and brushing my teeth. Then I would be on my way through farm country as I waved to semi-truck drivers and the people who got over for me. The day would probably be a bit windy and sunny as I trudged along. After a 30ish mile day, I would get to a county seat sometime in the afternoon with its brick lined roads and music playing from speakers in the downtown. I would stop at the local grocer for some things and head to a Mexican restaurant for some food. After a nice meal, I would head to the city campground, do some stretching and then pitch my tent under a picnic shelter and rest as the traffic on 36 slowly died down over the course of the night. Then we would get up and do it the next day with a little variation here and there. The consistency was unlike other states. Very fortunate for all of the public campgrounds. If your town doesn't have one, I highly recommend reaching out to your local officials to get one. I was so appreciative of them.

Along with appreciating the campgrounds, I really enjoyed getting to learn about Kansas. Whether it was the Orphan Train, The Kansas Experiment, The Ogallala Aquifer, Smokey Bear (not Smokey the bear), how much a tractor costs, the affinity for “Eat Beef” license plates, the Davis Memorial, gas station pizza and so much more. There really is so much to learn everywhere you go even in some of these small towns. I know I didn’t even visit any of the bigger cities in Kansas, but hopefully I will be back to see them again one day. 

I am very thankful to all the people who followed my adventure through their state and/or reached out. I got some great intel and insights from so many of you. Initially, I was hesitant to post because I did not think anyone would care. But that did not seem to be the case and I am very much appreciative for all who followed along. It was encouraging enough that I will continue to post in the subreddit of whatever state I’m in for the foreseeable future. So if you are interested in following the rest of my journey consider checking out r/missouri or my website walk2washington.com where these posts will appear in the blog. Place I am most active is IG at walk2washington, but all of that stuff goes to FB at I believe Washington2Washington.

Lastly, a call to action for anybody reading this. Please go out and walk more. Go walk around your neighborhood, go walk to get your groceries or an errand you usually do, go walk to your work, walk to school, park farther than where you normally would from a destination and make up the difference by walking. If you are ambitious, get dropped off somewhere and walk back, walk to the next town over, hell walk across Kansas if you can. I don’t know your circumstances and you will know what kind of walking works best for you. Not only is it great for your physical and mental well-being, but it will also give you a new perspective on the world around you. Just go out and walk.

That is all from me Kansas, the state was much more than just cornfields and wind and I was very fortunate to have walked through the Sunflower State. Wish me luck in Missouri and Ad Astra per Aspera.

I'm ever curious and was wondering if you could tell me more about the climate, weather, and seasons in Kansas. I can look at temperature indexes but without living it its it's hard to get a good sense of things. 

(I’m mainly interested in central Kansas, or the most isolated areas, but any region interests me too – are there any stark differences between regions?)

What months are known for what weather? What does that weather feel like? 

Is it hot/humid/freezing? Does the air feel heavy, smell of something in particular, or tell you anything about the weather to come?

What’s the season that makes you let out a sigh of relief? Which one brings tension?

I’ve never lived here so I wouldn’t even know what unique aspects to ask about, but any and all stories would be appreciated. Not just exciting things like tornados.

Thank you so much for helping me along with some research.",2023-12-11 21:16:35+00:00
335,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, love",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00

337,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, love",Kansas the Time to Ditch Gas and Switch to Heat Pumps Is Now,"There have been more posts and many people are talk just about how expensive gas heating has been getting here this year. If you are replacing your AC unit this summer or in the next few year I would highly suggest you look into getting a model that also functions as a heat pump(a cold climate one) installed, and just rip out your furnace. 

I ran the numbers for where I currently live and I estimated a heat pump is going to run about half of what last years heating cost in gas ran and that is with a high efficiency furnace. 

I plan in the next 5 years to remove all gas appliances from my home to save money. There is subsidies available to make it even more cheap. Heat pumps are cheaper then installing both an AC and Furnace, but will be more expensive then just an cheap AC unit, but given they can be more efficient then basic AC units at cooling so it can save money in the summer. 




I know what all the first responses are going to be

This is wrong, older older units loose performance in colder temperatures, but modern ones have no issues running well into the negatives here is someone having a Mitsubishi running just fine at -25F windchill.

Mitsubishi is selling heatpumps in Canada that run at 90% at -13F. 

You should be getting around 80% BTU output at -20F, Kansas is not all that cold its going to be running very efficiency 99% of the time, I don't plan to keep any kind of backup heating I don't think it is needed. Looking at the temperature records here in Manhattan, there only has been 4 temperature records below -22F, -18F was in 2021 in that freeze the heat pump certainly would have been running less efficiently, but still working. Obviously we aren't the colder part of Kansas, but something to keep in mind. 

Most models that are cold climate heat are also very efficient AC units the Mr Cool unit has double the SEER rating of the one i currently use so there would be savings during the summer as well. The DOE has also been doing funding for more domestic cold weather heatpumps and trying to push their temperatures further, so by the time your replacing things in a few years they could be even better. 

The benefits extend beyond saving you money, if your furnace is your only gas appliance you can eliminate the risk of Carbon Monoxide in your home or an explosive gas leak. 

Not to say there won't be issues, you are going to have to deal with making sure snow does not bury it, but this can mean just getting it up more off the ground, it won't be free, you will see an increase in your electric bill. 


In an extremely poorly built home it might not have the raw BTUs to keep up that a large gas furnace can output, so you may want to improve that with air sealing in your attic, adding insulation that is ideally not fiberglass, upgrading windows ect.

(I’m mainly interested in central Kansas, or the most isolated areas, but any region interests me too – are there any stark differences between regions?)

What months are known for what weather? What does that weather feel like? 

Is it hot/humid/freezing? Does the air feel heavy, smell of something in particular, or tell you anything about the weather to come?

What’s the season that makes you let out a sigh of relief? Which one brings tension?

I’ve never lived here so I wouldn’t even know what unique aspects to ask about, but any and all stories would be appreciated. Not just exciting things like tornados.

Thank you so much for helping me along with some research.",2023-12-11 21:16:35+00:00
345,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, enjoy",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00
346,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, enjoy",Hutch is pretty quiet. Even on a hot night.,"Had some time between loads so I took a little night ride on my folding bicycle. Rode from that tank wash where m6 truck was parked and proceeded to the Sunflower Trail. Front and rear lights and party LEDs lighting me up nice. While the trail was fun, i thought there'd be more people taking advantage of the slightly cooler night temps. 


But alas, just like Clovis where i currently live, all quiet after 9pm. Guess that indoor AC is hard to beat. Did enjoy a nice shake from Braums though!!",2024-07-20 05:28:12+00:00
347,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, enjoy",Kansas the Time to Ditch Gas and Switch to Heat Pumps Is Now,"There have been more posts and many people are talk just about how expensive gas heating has been getting here this year. If you are replacing your AC unit this summer or in the next few year I would highly suggest you look into getting a model that also functions as a heat pump(a cold climate one) installed, and just rip out your furnace. 

I ran the numbers for where I currently live and I estimated a heat pump is going to run about half of what last years heating cost in gas ran and that is with a high efficiency furnace. 

I plan in the next 5 years to remove all gas appliances from my home to save money. There is subsidies available to make it even more cheap. Heat pumps are cheaper then installing both an AC and Furnace, but will be more expensive then just an cheap AC unit, but given they can be more efficient then basic AC units at cooling so it can save money in the summer.

Mitsubishi is selling heatpumps in Canada that run at 90% at -13F. 

You should be getting around 80% BTU output at -20F, Kansas is not all that cold its going to be running very efficiency 99% of the time, I don't plan to keep any kind of backup heating I don't think it is needed. Looking at the temperature records here in Manhattan, there only has been 4 temperature records below -22F, -18F was in 2021 in that freeze the heat pump certainly would have been running less efficiently, but still working. Obviously we aren't the colder part of Kansas, but something to keep in mind. 

Most models that are cold climate heat are also very efficient AC units the Mr Cool unit has double the SEER rating of the one i currently use so there would be savings during the summer as well. The DOE has also been doing funding for more domestic cold weather heatpumps and trying to push their temperatures further, so by the time your replacing things in a few years they could be even better. 

The benefits extend beyond saving you money, if your furnace is your only gas appliance you can eliminate the risk of Carbon Monoxide in your home or an explosive gas leak. 

Not to say there won't be issues, you are going to have to deal with making sure snow does not bury it, but this can mean just getting it up more off the ground, it won't be free, you will see an increase in your electric bill. 


In an extremely poorly built home it might not have the raw BTUs to keep up that a large gas furnace can output, so you may want to improve that with air sealing in your attic, adding insulation that is ideally not fiberglass, upgrading windows ect.

Edit:

Someone is also going to argue that electricity won't be heating when the power is out, guess what neither will your furnace be blowing hot air when the electricity is out even if its gas due to electric ignition and blower that all run on electricity.

Edit Edit:

I am starting to suspect some people might have been told they were getting a cold climate model from their HVAC installer when they actually cheapened out and put in one not made for our climate and pocketed the money. That or HVAC installers are assuming a heat pump is a heat pump. 

There is videos of people in Canada using them, Norway uses a ton of them. What do you think is more likely these people don't have heating that works below 32F, OR maybe your HVAC installer fucked up and didn't get the correct models. 

If you do want to get a heat pump ask your installer for the spec sheet and what temperatures it is rated for, I wouldn't put in anything that does not work at least 80% performance at -5F and really think the ones like the Mr Cool, and Mitsubishi units that keep that into the -20F would perform in all conditions here in Kansas and those wouldn't even need aux heating.",2023-03-02 03:30:31+00:00

I ran the numbers for where I currently live and I estimated a heat pump is going to run about half of what last years heating cost in gas ran and that is with a high efficiency furnace.

Mitsubishi is selling heatpumps in Canada that run at 90% at -13F. 

You should be getting around 80% BTU output at -20F, Kansas is not all that cold its going to be running very efficiency 99% of the time, I don't plan to keep any kind of backup heating I don't think it is needed. Looking at the temperature records here in Manhattan, there only has been 4 temperature records below -22F, -18F was in 2021 in that freeze the heat pump certainly would have been running less efficiently, but still working. Obviously we aren't the colder part of Kansas, but something to keep in mind. 

Most models that are cold climate heat are also very efficient AC units the Mr Cool unit has double the SEER rating of the one i currently use so there would be savings during the summer as well. The DOE has also been doing funding for more domestic cold weather heatpumps and trying to push their temperatures further, so by the time your replacing things in a few years they could be even better. 

The benefits extend beyond saving you money, if your furnace is your only gas appliance you can eliminate the risk of Carbon Monoxide in your home or an explosive gas leak. 

Not to say there won't be issues, you are going to have to deal with making sure snow does not bury it, but this can mean just getting it up more off the ground, it won't be free, you will see an increase in your electric bill. 


In an extremely poorly built home it might not have the raw BTUs to keep up that a large gas furnace can output, so you may want to improve that with air sealing in your attic, adding insulation that is ideally not fiberglass, upgrading windows ect.

Someone is also going to argue that electricity won't be heating when the power is out, guess what neither will your furnace be blowing hot air when the electricity is out even if its gas due to electric ignition and blower that all run on electricity.

Edit Edit:

I am starting to suspect some people might have been told they were getting a cold climate model from their HVAC installer when they actually cheapened out and put in one not made for our climate and pocketed the money. That or HVAC installers are assuming a heat pump is a heat pump. 

There is videos of people in Canada using them, Norway uses a ton of them. What do you think is more likely these people don't have heating that works below 32F, OR maybe your HVAC installer fucked up and didn't get the correct models. 

If you do want to get a heat pump ask your installer for the spec sheet and what temperatures it is rated for, I wouldn't put in anything that does not work at least 80% performance at -5F and really think the ones like the Mr Cool, and Mitsubishi units that keep that into the -20F would perform in all conditions here in Kansas and those wouldn't even need aux heating.",2023-03-02 03:30:31+00:00

Good/bad apartments? Etc. Any advice is welcome and needed. Thank you!

The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives every thing its value.”

Tuesday was a powerful loss. Most of us have read his agenda 47, the Republican platform, and of course, the mandate for leadership. We know what’s coming. We know what he is going to try and do. And yes, it is formidable and it is scary. I am worried for my family. I am worried for what the future holds for me. And I’m worried for what the future looks like for the country.

I am tired and I am exhausted. I am tired of fighting for the right to exist. I am tired of fighting for the right to feel safe. I am tired of marginalized people in this country being the scapegoat. I am tired of the rights supposedly endowed by our creator to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness only applying to those as white and straight as the lined paper on the other side of the red lined margin. 

But, tired or not, I will fight. I will stand. For my spirit may be battered, but it is far from broken. My muscles may ache, but they are still strong. And my voice may be hoarse, but it is still powerful. I have shed my tears and cried my lament. I have spent time crumpled down in prayer and quiet anguish. Now it’s time to stand again. It’s time to dust myself off, and re-establish the chain forged in anger, sadness, and blessed sisterhood. The future is not set in stone. And the salt water that ruins their cement is more effective if it comes from our sweat, than if it comes from our tears.

We have two years to identify candidates, to campaign, and prepare to remove the teeth from the bumble. We must not look so far away as four years when the midterms are in 2026. We must start NOW to strategize and prepare to paint the house and senate in D.C, and in our states, blue. 

I gave too much of my energy, and my health to serve this country in order to just let it end like this. I am neither prepared to give up hope, nor ready to give up the fight. The future of our country lay ahead of us. And our legacy is born in moments like this. 

Let us fight…let us fight, like our lives and the lives of all of our siblings are on the line…like our very freedom to fight is what is at stake.

Mitsubishi is selling heatpumps in Canada that run at 90% at -13F. 

You should be getting around 80% BTU output at -20F, Kansas is not all that cold its going to be running very efficiency 99% of the time, I don't plan to keep any kind of backup heating I don't think it is needed. Looking at the temperature records here in Manhattan, there only has been 4 temperature records below -22F, -18F was in 2021 in that freeze the heat pump certainly would have been running less efficiently, but still working. Obviously we aren't the colder part of Kansas, but something to keep in mind. 

Most models that are cold climate heat are also very efficient AC units the Mr Cool unit has double the SEER rating of the one i currently use so there would be savings during the summer as well. The DOE has also been doing funding for more domestic cold weather heatpumps and trying to push their temperatures further, so by the time your replacing things in a few years they could be even better. 

The benefits extend beyond saving you money, if your furnace is your only gas appliance you can eliminate the risk of Carbon Monoxide in your home or an explosive gas leak. 

Not to say there won't be issues, you are going to have to deal with making sure snow does not bury it, but this can mean just getting it up more off the ground, it won't be free, you will see an increase in your electric bill. 


In an extremely poorly built home it might not have the raw BTUs to keep up that a large gas furnace can output, so you may want to improve that with air sealing in your attic, adding insulation that is ideally not fiberglass, upgrading windows ect.

Someone is also going to argue that electricity won't be heating when the power is out, guess what neither will your furnace be blowing hot air when the electricity is out even if its gas due to electric ignition and blower that all run on electricity.

Edit Edit:

I am starting to suspect some people might have been told they were getting a cold climate model from their HVAC installer when they actually cheapened out and put in one not made for our climate and pocketed the money. That or HVAC installers are assuming a heat pump is a heat pump. 

There is videos of people in Canada using them, Norway uses a ton of them. What do you think is more likely these people don't have heating that works below 32F, OR maybe your HVAC installer fucked up and didn't get the correct models. 

If you do want to get a heat pump ask your installer for the spec sheet and what temperatures it is rated for, I wouldn't put in anything that does not work at least 80% performance at -5F and really think the ones like the Mr Cool, and Mitsubishi units that keep that into the -20F would perform in all conditions here in Kansas and those wouldn't even need aux heating.",2023-03-02 03:30:31+00:00

Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives every thing its value.”

Tuesday was a powerful loss. Most of us have read his agenda 47, the Republican platform, and of course, the mandate for leadership. We know what’s coming. We know what he is going to try and do. And yes, it is formidable and it is scary. I am worried for my family. I am worried for what the future holds for me. And I’m worried for what the future looks like for the country.

I am tired and I am exhausted. I am tired of fighting for the right to exist. I am tired of fighting for the right to feel safe. I am tired of marginalized people in this country being the scapegoat. I am tired of the rights supposedly endowed by our creator to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness only applying to those as white and straight as the lined paper on the other side of the red lined margin. 

But, tired or not, I will fight. I will stand. For my spirit may be battered, but it is far from broken. My muscles may ache, but they are still strong. And my voice may be hoarse, but it is still powerful. I have shed my tears and cried my lament. I have spent time crumpled down in prayer and quiet anguish. Now it’s time to stand again. It’s time to dust myself off, and re-establish the chain forged in anger, sadness, and blessed sisterhood. The future is not set in stone. And the salt water that ruins their cement is more effective if it comes from our sweat, than if it comes from our tears.

We have two years to identify candidates, to campaign, and prepare to remove the teeth from the bumble. We must not look so far away as four years when the midterms are in 2026. We must start NOW to strategize and prepare to paint the house and senate in D.C, and in our states, blue. 

I gave too much of my energy, and my health to serve this country in order to just let it end like this. I am neither prepared to give up hope, nor ready to give up the fight. The future of our country lay ahead of us. And our legacy is born in moments like this. 

Let us fight…let us fight, like our lives and the lives of all of our siblings are on the line…like our very freedom to fight is what is at stake.

**Kansas Cornbread**

***Ingredients***:

&#x200B;

* 5 cups of flour
* 1 teaspoon onion powder
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/4 teaspoon turmeric
* 1/4 teaspoon cardamom
* 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
* A pinch of Kosher salt
* 2 cans of creamed corn
* 2 eggs
* 1 Tablespoon yeast
* 1 tab of butter, melted 

***Directions***:  In a small bowl, lightly scramble the 2 eggs, and add 1 can of creamed corn, stirring to combine.  Set aside.  Heat up the second can of creamed corn in a  microwave-safe bowl, until the temperature hits between 100 - 110  degrees.  Use a low or defrost setting to do this, you don't want a temp higher than 110 degrees, as that will kill the yeast. Stir to ensure even heat distribution, and recheck the temp with a quick read thermometer.   Add the yeast to the warmed creamed corn, and set aside for 5-10 minutes to allow it to bloom (the yeast will react nicely to the sugars from the corn).  While the yeast is blooming, in a large mixing bowl, add the flour, onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper,  turmeric, cardamom, optional cayenne pepper, and Koser salt, and stir to incorporate.  Add the creamed corn mixed with the egg, and stir to incorporate.  Add the second creamed corn with the yeast and stir until a  soft dough forms.  Knead on a lightly floured surface, just enough to ensure all ingredients are incorporated and the dough is slightly moist throughout, you don't want to overwork it.  You can also do this with a  stand mixer using a dough hook on speed 2.  Place in a large greased bowl, turning to coat.  Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place for about an hour, until doubled in size.  Preheat the oven to 350  degrees. pour the melted butter over the top and bake in a 9-inch square cake pan for 50-55 minutes, or until the edges are golden, brown, and delicious and a toothpick poked in the center comes out clean.  Let rest on a wire rack for at least 10-15 minutes before slicing.

&#x200B;

[ This bread toasts up really nice in a pan with a little olive oil or put on the grill to pick up a hint of smoke ](https://preview.redd.it/q68hggxbe1va1.jpg?width=2793&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9a83f835720f96262b185fb1e8a5f4aad70ac67)

This is a heartier loaf than a traditional cornbread, soaks up sauces and gravies much better, and toasts up really nice. 

Recipe option, one jalapeno diced up is a nice addition.

Now you know how to use that creamed corn that's been sitting in your pantry for months!

1. I don't want it to be super hot, but still green enough for good photos. When specifically should I visit?

2. Looking for food reccomendations pretty much anywhere. I'm not picky, like trying new things. Would be takeout unless it's dog friendly.

3. General advice/comments/insults? Any must see's I'm missing close to my route?

Stir to ensure even heat distribution, and recheck the temp with a quick read thermometer.   Add the yeast to the warmed creamed corn, and set aside for 5-10 minutes to allow it to bloom (the yeast will react nicely to the sugars from the corn).  While the yeast is blooming, in a large mixing bowl, add the flour, onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper,  turmeric, cardamom, optional cayenne pepper, and Koser salt, and stir to incorporate.  Add the creamed corn mixed with the egg, and stir to incorporate.  Add the second creamed corn with the yeast and stir until a  soft dough forms.  Knead on a lightly floured surface, just enough to ensure all ingredients are incorporated and the dough is slightly moist throughout, you don't want to overwork it.  You can also do this with a  stand mixer using a dough hook on speed 2.  Place in a large greased bowl, turning to coat.  Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place for about an hour, until doubled in size.  Preheat the oven to 350  degrees. pour the melted butter over the top and bake in a 9-inch square cake pan for 50-55 minutes, or until the edges are golden, brown, and delicious and a toothpick poked in the center comes out clean.  Let rest on a wire rack for at least 10-15 minutes before slicing.

This is a heartier loaf than a traditional cornbread, soaks up sauces and gravies much better, and toasts up really nice. 

Recipe option, one jalapeno diced up is a nice addition.

Now you know how to use that creamed corn that's been sitting in your pantry for months!

If you are replacing your AC unit this summer or in the next few year I would highly suggest you look into getting a model that also functions as a heat pump(a cold climate one) installed, and just rip out your furnace. 

I ran the numbers for where I currently live and I estimated a heat pump is going to run about half of what last years heating cost in gas ran and that is with a high efficiency furnace. 

I plan in the next 5 years to remove all gas appliances from my home to save money. There is subsidies available to make it even more cheap. Heat pumps are cheaper then installing both an AC and Furnace, but will be more expensive then just an cheap AC unit, but given they can be more efficient then basic AC units at cooling so it can save money in the summer.

This is wrong, older older units loose performance in colder temperatures, but modern ones have no issues running well into the negatives here is someone having a Mitsubishi running just fine at -25F windchill.

Mitsubishi is selling heatpumps in Canada that run at 90% at -13F. 

You should be getting around 80% BTU output at -20F, Kansas is not all that cold its going to be running very efficiency 99% of the time, I don't plan to keep any kind of backup heating I don't think it is needed. Looking at the temperature records here in Manhattan, there only has been 4 temperature records below -22F, -18F was in 2021 in that freeze the heat pump certainly would have been running less efficiently, but still working. Obviously we aren't the colder part of Kansas, but something to keep in mind. 

Most models that are cold climate heat are also very efficient AC units the Mr Cool unit has double the SEER rating of the one i currently use so there would be savings during the summer as well. The DOE has also been doing funding for more domestic cold weather heatpumps and trying to push their temperatures further, so by the time your replacing things in a few years they could be even better. 

The benefits extend beyond saving you money, if your furnace is your only gas appliance you can eliminate the risk of Carbon Monoxide in your home or an explosive gas leak. 

Not to say there won't be issues, you are going to have to deal with making sure snow does not bury it, but this can mean just getting it up more off the ground, it won't be free, you will see an increase in your electric bill. 


In an extremely poorly built home it might not have the raw BTUs to keep up that a large gas furnace can output, so you may want to improve that with air sealing in your attic, adding insulation that is ideally not fiberglass, upgrading windows ect.

Someone is also going to argue that electricity won't be heating when the power is out, guess what neither will your furnace be blowing hot air when the electricity is out even if its gas due to electric ignition and blower that all run on electricity.

Edit Edit:

I am starting to suspect some people might have been told they were getting a cold climate model from their HVAC installer when they actually cheapened out and put in one not made for our climate and pocketed the money. That or HVAC installers are assuming a heat pump is a heat pump. 

There is videos of people in Canada using them, Norway uses a ton of them. What do you think is more likely these people don't have heating that works below 32F, OR maybe your HVAC installer fucked up and didn't get the correct models. 

If you do want to get a heat pump ask your installer for the spec sheet and what temperatures it is rated for, I wouldn't put in anything that does not work at least 80% performance at -5F and really think the ones like the Mr Cool, and Mitsubishi units that keep that into the -20F would perform in all conditions here in Kansas and those wouldn't even need aux heating.",2023-03-02 03:30:31+00:00

Stir to ensure even heat distribution, and recheck the temp with a quick read thermometer.   Add the yeast to the warmed creamed corn, and set aside for 5-10 minutes to allow it to bloom (the yeast will react nicely to the sugars from the corn).  While the yeast is blooming, in a large mixing bowl, add the flour, onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper,  turmeric, cardamom, optional cayenne pepper, and Koser salt, and stir to incorporate.  Add the creamed corn mixed with the egg, and stir to incorporate.  Add the second creamed corn with the yeast and stir until a  soft dough forms.  Knead on a lightly floured surface, just enough to ensure all ingredients are incorporated and the dough is slightly moist throughout, you don't want to overwork it.  You can also do this with a  stand mixer using a dough hook on speed 2.  Place in a large greased bowl, turning to coat.  Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place for about an hour, until doubled in size.  Preheat the oven to 350  degrees. pour the melted butter over the top and bake in a 9-inch square cake pan for 50-55 minutes, or until the edges are golden, brown, and delicious and a toothpick poked in the center comes out clean.  Let rest on a wire rack for at least 10-15 minutes before slicing.

If you are replacing your AC unit this summer or in the next few year I would highly suggest you look into getting a model that also functions as a heat pump(a cold climate one) installed, and just rip out your furnace. 

I ran the numbers for where I currently live and I estimated a heat pump is going to run about half of what last years heating cost in gas ran and that is with a high efficiency furnace. 

I plan in the next 5 years to remove all gas appliances from my home to save money. There is subsidies available to make it even more cheap. Heat pumps are cheaper then installing both an AC and Furnace, but will be more expensive then just an cheap AC unit, but given they can be more efficient then basic AC units at cooling so it can save money in the summer.

This is wrong, older older units loose performance in colder temperatures, but modern ones have no issues running well into the negatives here is someone having a Mitsubishi running just fine at -25F windchill.

Mitsubishi is selling heatpumps in Canada that run at 90% at -13F. 

You should be getting around 80% BTU output at -20F, Kansas is not all that cold its going to be running very efficiency 99% of the time, I don't plan to keep any kind of backup heating I don't think it is needed. Looking at the temperature records here in Manhattan, there only has been 4 temperature records below -22F, -18F was in 2021 in that freeze the heat pump certainly would have been running less efficiently, but still working. Obviously we aren't the colder part of Kansas, but something to keep in mind. 

Most models that are cold climate heat are also very efficient AC units the Mr Cool unit has double the SEER rating of the one i currently use so there would be savings during the summer as well. The DOE has also been doing funding for more domestic cold weather heatpumps and trying to push their temperatures further, so by the time your replacing things in a few years they could be even better. 

The benefits extend beyond saving you money, if your furnace is your only gas appliance you can eliminate the risk of Carbon Monoxide in your home or an explosive gas leak. 

Not to say there won't be issues, you are going to have to deal with making sure snow does not bury it, but this can mean just getting it up more off the ground, it won't be free, you will see an increase in your electric bill. 


In an extremely poorly built home it might not have the raw BTUs to keep up that a large gas furnace can output, so you may want to improve that with air sealing in your attic, adding insulation that is ideally not fiberglass, upgrading windows ect. 



This is a pretty good video on heat pumps

Edit:

Someone is also going to argue that electricity won't be heating when the power is out, guess what neither will your furnace be blowing hot air when the electricity is out even if its gas due to electric ignition and blower that all run on electricity.

Edit Edit:

I am starting to suspect some people might have been told they were getting a cold climate model from their HVAC installer when they actually cheapened out and put in one not made for our climate and pocketed the money. That or HVAC installers are assuming a heat pump is a heat pump. 

There is videos of people in Canada using them, Norway uses a ton of them. What do you think is more likely these people don't have heating that works below 32F, OR maybe your HVAC installer fucked up and didn't get the correct models. 

If you do want to get a heat pump ask your installer for the spec sheet and what temperatures it is rated for, I wouldn't put in anything that does not work at least 80% performance at -5F and really think the ones like the Mr Cool, and Mitsubishi units that keep that into the -20F would perform in all conditions here in Kansas and those wouldn't even need aux heating.",2023-03-02 03:30:31+00:00

This is a heartier loaf than a traditional cornbread, soaks up sauces and gravies much better, and toasts up really nice. 

Recipe option, one jalapeno diced up is a nice addition.

Now you know how to use that creamed corn that's been sitting in your pantry for months!

491,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, warm, love",Day 11-13 of Walking Across Kansas (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

Currently writing to you from the wonderful town of Washington, KS. I was able to make it here in 3 days from Smith Center after I took a rest day to get over my little illness. Felt much better after taking a day to recover. 

The day I left off from Smith Center didn’t get off to a great start when I locked myself out of my hotel room in order to go stretch. The Innkeeper of the Buckshot Inn was up in Nebraska getting Chemo, so there wasn’t a way to get back in. She told me to try and pick the lock, which was much easier said than done with a Casey’s gift card. Eventually a guy she called came to come replace the lock. If you are ever in Smith Center please go visit the Buckshot Inn the people there are really nice and gave me 2 nights for $19, and I’m sure that they would appreciate the business. 

After the delay, I headed to Mankato. Along the way I got to pass the geographic center of the US which was pretty neat. Kansas is really at the center of the country (at least the lower 48). Eventually I made it to Mankato and I’m sure some of you are familiar with Mankato because the YouTube channel “Yes Theory” threw a Party in “the most boring town in America” there. It was kind of funny because I didn’t know what “Yes Theory” was until I got to Mankato. Nice town though.

On Thursday the goal was to get to Belleville. Easier said than done with a headwind. After I passed Scandia, the clouds started to look ominous so I was looking for a way to get off 36 when the storm rolled in. As soon as I got off it started raining and I quickly made my way to a barn. There I took shelter with Farmer John and his dog Mav. I had a nice time talking with Farmer John about the harvest and how much all of his farm equipment cost. After the rain I set out and Mav really wanted to come walking across Kansas with me. Farmer John had to come get him a couple of times. He had also warned me about the mud, which I thought I could push through. I couldn’t. So I had to trudge my way back to 36. Once I got back on there I made my way to Belleville.

Then finally yesterday the goal was to get to Washington. Which was a place that I was really looking forward to because the goal of my walk is to get from Washington state to Washington DC, so it was fun to stop at a Washington in the middle. Because of a hefty tail wind I was able to do about 33 miles in about 5 hours. The ancient midwestern proverb of “it wouldn’t be so cold/bad without the wind” was in full effect today. I even heard some people say it in Belleville. As such instead of pitching my tent at the campground, I decided to pitch my tent in the warm and spacious shower room at the campground. Not as bad as it sounds. Unfortunately I forgot to lock the door last night, so at around 11:30 last night, a guy comes in to take a shower and it scared the bejezzes out of me. His water heater had broke and he was a nice guy so not terrible, but definitely locked the door after that. 

Plan for today is to get to Marysville. Its looking like I’ll probably be able to finish Kansas on October 18th. Sorry to people on here who wanted me to come to Manhattan, Lawrence and Topeka but I gotta make it to St Joe to see my grandparents and cant delay with the weather getting colder. Because some people on here said I could walk across 36 into St Joseph, I reached out to their police department and they said I could and that they would even help me cross. So that’ll save me some time.

Other than that im still enjoying my time in Kansas and meeting lots of great people. As always the best place to follow my journey is on IG at walk2washington or at my website of the same name.

Additional thoughts:

1. A lot more trees: I have definitely noticed a decent amount more trees as I’ve gotten farther East. It is appreciated and im enjoying seeing the tinges of yellow. 

2. Towns that play music: IDk if this is a Kansas thing but this didn’t happen in any of the other states that I’ve walked through, but a lot of the towns play music out loud in their downtowns. It is  not bad, but it is kinda eerie when downtown is empty.

3. Windmills: I didn’t see any wind farms until I got to Belleville. For such a windy state I really expected there to be more. Especially since the land can still be used for farming and ranching. 

4. No breakfast spots: I often go to Mexican restaurants when I go to town for lunch or dinner because there is usually one in a town. But since I start most days in a town, I would love to get a hot breakfast;however, so many towns that I pass through don’t really have a spot or the spot is really inconvenient. 

5. Shrinking towns: Whenever I pass through a town I always check the Wikipedia page for info. Something I’ve noticed in most of the towns and counties that I’ve passed through though is that populations seem to be shrinking. I’ve also seen that school closures have been an issue in this area too. Im sure there are parts of Kansas that are growing, but are these trends common in other parts of the state?",2023-10-14 13:59:11+00:00
492,Kansas,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, warm, love",Urgent cat and kittens rehoming needed,"Located in Wichita. A bit ago I saved some cats from starving to death and have been fruitlessly trying, and failing, to manage to find them shelter, foster, or rehoming placement, enough for all of them. I've made two prior posts to the local sub [here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wichita/comments/1g1ly4d/urgent_rehoming_needed_abandoned_cats_and_kittens/)and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wichita/comments/1g6squh/urgent_rehoming_still_needed_abandoned_cats_and/), and have made many attempts to post on facebook with a lot of constant rejections spam filtering etc due to my account age. I've called every single place I can find in the state with no help either, so at this point it's either they have rehoming or nothing. I'm out of time and options they need to go somewhere ASAP.

I will drive anywhere in the state, even all the way to neighboring states, but I've still not found any takers. I hope this is ok I found similar posts and they're still up.

Remaining cats are Princess (adult female mother), 2 female kittens (lucy, bandit), and 1 male (hobbes). All litterbox trained, have been treated for fleas again recently with frontline, and they're not feral or hostile just skittish and will need some patience. Princess is completely tame and loves people, but her remaining kittens still need some time and warming up to people.

Demi was cold and scared but after a few hours of building trust, we got her inside, fed and warm. She has been “borrowing” our puppy’s kennel for now. This morning I took her to the groomers and she had her (way overgrown) nails done and got a nice bath. She’s looking good!

I used to volunteer with the Humane Society, so I’ve already reached out to some local organizations. That said, I am taking a shot at finding her a new home on my own.

If anyone is interested in giving this sweet little girl a new home, please reach out. I can tell you that she is very calm/sleepy, but she still has a little spunk (she tried to jump clear up in my jeep, lol!), she gets along fine with my dogs, and she loves hanging in a kennel when I can’t watch her actively. Only con I see in her is she could probably stand to lose a few pounds, especially after the treats I’ve given her.

**Kansas Cornbread**

***Ingredients***:

&#x200B;

* 5 cups of flour
* 1 teaspoon onion powder
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/4 teaspoon turmeric
* 1/4 teaspoon cardamom
* 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
* A pinch of Kosher salt
* 2 cans of creamed corn
* 2 eggs
* 1 Tablespoon yeast
* 1 tab of butter, melted 

***Directions***:  In a small bowl, lightly scramble the 2 eggs, and add 1 can of creamed corn, stirring to combine.  Set aside.  Heat up the second can of creamed corn in a  microwave-safe bowl, until the temperature hits between 100 - 110  degrees.  Use a low or defrost setting to do this, you don't want a temp higher than 110 degrees, as that will kill the yeast. Stir to ensure even heat distribution, and recheck the temp with a quick read thermometer.   Add the yeast to the warmed creamed corn, and set aside for 5-10 minutes to allow it to bloom (the yeast will react nicely to the sugars from the corn).  While the yeast is blooming, in a large mixing bowl, add the flour, onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper,  turmeric, cardamom, optional cayenne pepper, and Koser salt, and stir to incorporate.  Add the creamed corn mixed with the egg, and stir to incorporate.  Add the second creamed corn with the yeast and stir until a  soft dough forms.  Knead on a lightly floured surface, just enough to ensure all ingredients are incorporated and the dough is slightly moist throughout, you don't want to overwork it.  You can also do this with a  stand mixer using a dough hook on speed 2.  Place in a large greased bowl, turning to coat.  Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place for about an hour, until doubled in size.  Preheat the oven to 350  degrees. pour the melted butter over the top and bake in a 9-inch square cake pan for 50-55 minutes, or until the edges are golden, brown, and delicious and a toothpick poked in the center comes out clean.  Let rest on a wire rack for at least 10-15 minutes before slicing.

Stir to ensure even heat distribution, and recheck the temp with a quick read thermometer.   Add the yeast to the warmed creamed corn, and set aside for 5-10 minutes to allow it to bloom (the yeast will react nicely to the sugars from the corn).  While the yeast is blooming, in a large mixing bowl, add the flour, onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper,  turmeric, cardamom, optional cayenne pepper, and Koser salt, and stir to incorporate.  Add the creamed corn mixed with the egg, and stir to incorporate.  Add the second creamed corn with the yeast and stir until a  soft dough forms.  Knead on a lightly floured surface, just enough to ensure all ingredients are incorporated and the dough is slightly moist throughout, you don't want to overwork it.  You can also do this with a  stand mixer using a dough hook on speed 2.  Place in a large greased bowl, turning to coat.  Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place for about an hour, until doubled in size.  Preheat the oven to 350  degrees. pour the melted butter over the top and bake in a 9-inch square cake pan for 50-55 minutes, or until the edges are golden, brown, and delicious and a toothpick poked in the center comes out clean.  Let rest on a wire rack for at least 10-15 minutes before slicing.

Here's a terrific bread that combines the sweetcorn taste of Iowa (my home state) with the wheat of Kansas (my adopted state)!

A non-traditional cornbread, there's no cornmeal in this recipe. It's super easy to put together and has no added sugar.  On a personal note,  I prefer it over the traditional stuff.

So far, we have been to Lyons, Sterling, Hutchinson, and Arlington. Tried to go to Nickerson, but Sunshine Cafe was closed

Any suggestions for great small town cafes around the state?

Edit: Update- I recently tried the B&G at Doo Dah Diner in Wichita. Honestly, 10/10 would recommend. 

I'm looking forward to trying more of your suggestions and reporting back what I discover. 

Thank you all for you're input and if there are more, please keep em' coming!

What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives every thing its value.”

Tuesday was a powerful loss. Most of us have read his agenda 47, the Republican platform, and of course, the mandate for leadership. We know what’s coming. We know what he is going to try and do. And yes, it is formidable and it is scary. I am worried for my family. I am worried for what the future holds for me. And I’m worried for what the future looks like for the country.

I am tired and I am exhausted. I am tired of fighting for the right to exist. I am tired of fighting for the right to feel safe. I am tired of marginalized people in this country being the scapegoat. I am tired of the rights supposedly endowed by our creator to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness only applying to those as white and straight as the lined paper on the other side of the red lined margin. 

But, tired or not, I will fight. I will stand. For my spirit may be battered, but it is far from broken. My muscles may ache, but they are still strong. And my voice may be hoarse, but it is still powerful. I have shed my tears and cried my lament. I have spent time crumpled down in prayer and quiet anguish. Now it’s time to stand again. It’s time to dust myself off, and re-establish the chain forged in anger, sadness, and blessed sisterhood. The future is not set in stone. And the salt water that ruins their cement is more effective if it comes from our sweat, than if it comes from our tears.

We have two years to identify candidates, to campaign, and prepare to remove the teeth from the bumble. We must not look so far away as four years when the midterms are in 2026. We must start NOW to strategize and prepare to paint the house and senate in D.C, and in our states, blue. 

I gave too much of my energy, and my health to serve this country in order to just let it end like this. I am neither prepared to give up hope, nor ready to give up the fight. The future of our country lay ahead of us. And our legacy is born in moments like this. 

Let us fight…let us fight, like our lives and the lives of all of our siblings are on the line…like our very freedom to fight is what is at stake.

Let us fight…let us fight, like our lives and the lives of all of our siblings are on the line…like our very freedom to fight is what is at stake. Because in all truth, all hyperbole aside, it truly is. Our opportunity on Tuesday was lost, but our opportunity today has only just begun.",2024-11-07 17:12:32+00:00

527,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunny, love",Where should we live?," 

My partner and I are moving from Denver, CO as soon as I finish grad school and are looking for our next home. Here's a little bit about us and what we're ideally looking for (edit: I realize this is idealistic, and we're ready to make some compromises as needed):

\-I'll be working as a therapist & would love to have good opportunities for jobs with decent pay. I'm finishing a very long grad program in May!

\-My partner has recently started working as a paralegal

\-we're both pretty left-leaning politically and would like to have at least a small community of like-minded people wherever we live. Big on mutual aid. We don't need to be in a totally blue area, but also don't want to get run out of town for believing in climate change.

\-somewhere with some art, music, culture, cool stuff, maybe a little grungy

\-looking for somewhere green! We want to have a garden with a somewhat decent and would love access to other produce. This is a BIG DEAL to me. I grew up in AZ and they are steadily running out of water. I want to live somewhere where this isn't a major concern.

\-ideally somewhere that doesn't get TOO cold or TOO snowy, but we're coming from Denver, so we can handle some. This means I want to avoid a place where it rarely gets above 20 in the winter or it heavy snow stays all winter long. Were used to temps 20-50 all winter and snow of 1/8in-2 feet several times a month. My friends' stories about the midwest changed my perception of what cold actually means.

\-also somewhere that isn't wildly hot. I lived in Phoenix for awhile, and that was too hot. Denver gets into the 100s sometimes and it's not fun, but manageable.

\-sunshine - I don't need anywhere as sunny as Denver, but I'd love to see the sun at least a few times a month in the winter.

\-accessible hiking/biking/camping. The southwest has an excess of free public lands that we've gotten used to.

\-affordable! We're hoping to buy a house for under $400k with a decent yard. If we could get acreage in that price, that would be incredible.

\-safety/low crime is important to us at this point. We'll be starting a family in the next five years, so also decent schools.

\-ideally, we'd like to live in a smaller town (under 100k people) and could be very small (under 5k), if it's within 30 min of a bigger town/city where we could access all the necessities. Would love to be able to walk to some basics, but still have space.

Clarification:

I grew up in a town of 50k people and that was WAY big enough to live in without any other city nearby. My partner grew up in a town of 1500 with some real basics. There was a bigger city (200k) within 30 minutes. Both of these are great.

My dad lives in rural florida (not even in a town) and it's 20 minutes to the closest business (a gas station), and another 15 to the closest town of like 2,000 people. For them to buy most necessities, they have to drive an hour to Wal-mart. I'm not interested in that level of rural.",2023-01-15 17:40:12+00:00

We have looked into a lot of info to pick a state and are pretty set on Kentucky for a number of reasons. That being said we have never moved out of state or looked and it's a bit hard online to sort the reality & truth from the bs and pomp.

I will try to highlight some keypoints of what we are looking for but would appreciate ANY help in narrowing down good cities to look into or just as importantly good cities to AVOID.

&#x200B;

* We are looking for suburbs. This is pretty important. We like our own space and while we don't want full blown country with the nearest hospital or store being an hour away we would like to avoid a street with house after house on top of each other.  Suburbs with a 10-20 minute city away would be great. Would like businesses/stores/doctors/fast food places/jobs etc within a realistic distance away.
* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state. We enjoy all 4 seasons but living currently near buffalo we are so done with snow storms that give us literally feet of lake effect snow. On the flip side not a huge fan of super hot and humid. I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine. We are NOT looking for a fixer upper or a ""dump"" that needs a ton of work. Probably something  like 2-3 bedrooms 2-3 bathrooms. Does not need to have a huge yard or a ton of land (actually don't want a  TON of land).
* Amenities and attractions and such don't matter very much. We both spend the majority of our time in house or in yard and don't ever really go out much besides for normal shopping and such. Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

Anyway thought I would ask reddit because it's such good source of factual info. Any help would be appreciated. Probably won't be moving for 2-3 years but would like to start narrowing things down and at least finding a good area to look in.  Any help from anyone out there who has a nice area or has visited a nice area or any info at all would be awesome.

Strong to severe storms will be possible again today before we look to get a break by tomorrow. The Storm Prediction Center has upgraded most of the state to an Enhanced Risk (3/5) in their latest outlook. 

Some showers and storms moved across the state early this morning, but some clearing is taking place now. This will allow for some destabilization and help storms to form later this afternoon and evening. Damaging winds will be the main threat!

Happy Thursday, everyone!  All eyes are on our severe storm threat over the next three days as rounds of showers and storms look to ride along the edge of a building ridge.  This morning a complex of strong to severe storms is pushing across parts of western Kentucky.  Damaging winds have been the main threat thus far.

Later this evening, another round of storms looks to roll across the state.  The location of this round is still in question.  The latest hi-res models are showing this cluster all over the place.  The newest HRRR run shows this impacting more of central and eastern Kentucky but weakening as it pushes into the state. This is definitely something to watch for most of the region.  

More rounds of strong to severe storms look possible Friday and Saturday, and the focus of these rounds should shift to the northeast of our round so far today.  Each MCS's timings, location, and severity are still in question.  Uncertainty is high because of the difficulty of forecasting these Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS's) riding along the edge of a ridge.

541,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, love",Looking for a local take on the most interesting points of interest in Kentucky,"Hi, Kentucky!

This is my next stop on my way to visiting the subreddits of every state in the United States, every province and territory of Canada, and every country across the rest of the world.

This isn't for any sort of website or blog. It's for my own personal edification, in case I'm ever able to make it to all of these great places. I'm hoping I'll be able to talk with some friendly people along the way in finding out about the most interesting points of interest in each place (or, at least, please be friendlier than [r/Arizona](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arizona/) who permanently banned me for asking this exact same question).

I have done a little bit of searching on my own already and have a small list of places I think would be interesting to see, but I would love to know more about what your state has to offer, and I thought it would be great to get those recommendations from people who live there. I know there has to be more than what the travel websites have to offer.

I'm looking for any sort of point of interest, whether its a cool State Park, a monument, memorial, interesting building, historical point of interest, something offbeat and silly, scenic nature, or even a recurring event.

Here's what I have so far, and I'm hoping you can add to it!

1. Mammoth Cave
2. Churchill Downs
3. Cumberland Falls State Resort Park
4. Louisville Belle
5. Natural Bridge
6. The Versailles Castle
7. Fort Knox
8. The Shaker Village 
9. The Pinnacles

I'm also doing a little food section, as well. From what I've uncovered, the four essential foods I should try in your state are the following. Let me know if this sounds right:

1. Hot Brown
2. Derby Pie
3. Bourbon Balls
4. Mint Julep ",2024-03-27 01:48:43+00:00
542,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, hot, love",Tobacco Patch,"Here is a photo of a Pendleton County tobacco patch. Like so many good Kentuckians, I was raised pullin', settin', hoein', toppin', cuttin', housin', strippin', bailin', and sellin', this ole sticky weed.  Looking back, I thank God; for it taught me many life lessons. 
     
     First lesson was, family is important. While wondering through the seasons of my youth I remember, everyone worked together to harvest a good crop, of which we could be proud.  We didn't have the best tractor or nicest stripping room, (actually we had to borrow both tractor and stripping room a few times) but we appreciated what we had.  The hours spent walking behind mom, grandma and my aunts on the setter or next to them in the stripping room, are precious memories which I'll always cherish.  The discussions were always as hot as the winter wood stove, except when a UK basketball game would be on the radio. Talking was then only allowed during commercials breaks. 

     Secondly, I learned that everyone must pull the weight, or the burden will become too heavy. As a child, we played in the fields while the adults toiled, but as we got older, tasks were assigned. At first they were simple; like pick up the fallen leaves, or cut and tie new bail strings. Then as age sold us out and we grew older, our jobs got harder. As a smaller and skinnier man, I could climb to the top of the barn faster than most, while housing. It was hot up there, but you only had to handle half of the sticks and dirt wouldn't fall in your eyes or on your neck like being the ""middle man"". Oh, how proud I was to finally get my own spear and knife and be placed in a row with the men! Though, after about fifteen minutes I wanted to be back with the kids again! It took the whole group to make it work. Today, it's an honor to look back and be apart of it.

     Last lesson is, hard work pays off. Tobacco was the most difficult task that I can remember. My grandfather likes to state in his infinite wisdom, ""it's a 13 month a year crop!"" I've heard stories about the time before the pull-behind setters, and I remember the meticulousness of rolling back the white canvas and pulling weeds out of the tobacco beds and the pain of kneeling for eternity on a 2X10 suspended across some cinder blocks. It was a difficult work to do, but now I know why my family did it; Christmas. You see, that's what they would buy our gifts with. That ladies and gentlemen, is the true definition of love, to labor for a harvest and then give it away!

    It was in this dirt and dust where lessons about respect, honesty, and service were reiterated and traditions/heritage were discussed with reverence. Our story of a people and blood-line was told and family ties were strengthened. I worked the ground because my grandpa did, and his grandpa did before him, all the way back. We did it because we loved one another. While time and death may separate us, every time I see a picture like this, my heart wells with the love that I received, from working in this damned old weed! Thank you Lord, for putting us together as a family, and sticking us on that ridge, in our little farm community, and giving us our abilities to work.",2023-08-21 13:57:02+00:00

We have looked into a lot of info to pick a state and are pretty set on Kentucky for a number of reasons. That being said we have never moved out of state or looked and it's a bit hard online to sort the reality & truth from the bs and pomp.

I will try to highlight some keypoints of what we are looking for but would appreciate ANY help in narrowing down good cities to look into or just as importantly good cities to AVOID.

&#x200B;

* We are looking for suburbs. This is pretty important. We like our own space and while we don't want full blown country with the nearest hospital or store being an hour away we would like to avoid a street with house after house on top of each other.  Suburbs with a 10-20 minute city away would be great. Would like businesses/stores/doctors/fast food places/jobs etc within a realistic distance away.
* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state. We enjoy all 4 seasons but living currently near buffalo we are so done with snow storms that give us literally feet of lake effect snow. On the flip side not a huge fan of super hot and humid. I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine. We are NOT looking for a fixer upper or a ""dump"" that needs a ton of work. Probably something  like 2-3 bedrooms 2-3 bathrooms. Does not need to have a huge yard or a ton of land (actually don't want a  TON of land).
* Amenities and attractions and such don't matter very much. We both spend the majority of our time in house or in yard and don't ever really go out much besides for normal shopping and such. Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

Anyway thought I would ask reddit because it's such good source of factual info. Any help would be appreciated. Probably won't be moving for 2-3 years but would like to start narrowing things down and at least finding a good area to look in.  Any help from anyone out there who has a nice area or has visited a nice area or any info at all would be awesome.

Thanks in advance!!

Happy Thursday, everyone!  All eyes are on our severe storm threat over the next three days as rounds of showers and storms look to ride along the edge of a building ridge.  This morning a complex of strong to severe storms is pushing across parts of western Kentucky.  Damaging winds have been the main threat thus far.

Later this evening, another round of storms looks to roll across the state.  The location of this round is still in question.  The latest hi-res models are showing this cluster all over the place.  The newest HRRR run shows this impacting more of central and eastern Kentucky but weakening as it pushes into the state. This is definitely something to watch for most of the region.  

More rounds of strong to severe storms look possible Friday and Saturday, and the focus of these rounds should shift to the northeast of our round so far today.  Each MCS's timings, location, and severity are still in question.  Uncertainty is high because of the difficulty of forecasting these Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS's) riding along the edge of a ridge.

We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine. We are NOT looking for a fixer upper or a ""dump"" that needs a ton of work. Probably something  like 2-3 bedrooms 2-3 bathrooms. Does not need to have a huge yard or a ton of land (actually don't want a  TON of land).
* Amenities and attractions and such don't matter very much. We both spend the majority of our time in house or in yard and don't ever really go out much besides for normal shopping and such. Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

Anyway thought I would ask reddit because it's such good source of factual info. Any help would be appreciated.

571,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, love",Moving From OR to KY: Is This a Match?,"My husband and I are in our early 30’s looking to cash in on our equity from our pricey Oregon area and are thinking about moving to central Kentucky/Bluegrass region. We are planning our first trip for February. We currently live in a rural county, a few miles outside of the nicest, richest city in our county with a population of 25k. We are within 30 minutes to several similar sized cities/towns with shopping or restaurant options. We have a small several acre property and keep small livestock. My husband and I both own own businesses and work from home. We make around $160k combined per year currently, and would like to steer clear from areas known for drugs or crime as we hope to start a family. We like a country, slower paced, less populated way of life but still like to go out to eat and meet at coffee shops with friends, etc. every now and again and don’t mind driving 30ish minutes to do so. We are mostly homebodies, love walking/hiking, country drives, kayaking, ATVs, we are interested in horses, keeping livestock animals, and love our dogs. 
 
Why we’re attracted to Kentucky:
1.     Affordability
2.     Land with seemingly decent looking/sized houses with shops and barns (you have to pay around $1m for that in our current area)
3.     In the Bluegrass region, properties seem close-ish to the two main cities for entertainment, connections, etc. 
4.     4 seasons
5.     Even just a tiny bit of snow? We get get zero now, so any at all would be neat
6.     People are nice? We read it’s a highly rated area for “nice” folks. Oregon, not so much...
7.     Horses
8.     Near lots of different states and areas; the midwest, the south, the east coast 
 
Things we’re worried about:
1.     Humid summers; our summers are 0%
2.     Tornadoes! More insight/info on living alongside these would be so helpful
3.     Snakes; only ever see the occasional garden snake here now
 
If anyone has opinions on if Kentucky seems like a good fit for us and has any additional info, education, or insights into anything regarding Kentucky, but also about our concern points, that would be so helpful! Thank you!",2024-01-11 02:49:16+00:00

582,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, summer, hate",Questions about moving to Kentucky as a teacher ,"I’m currently finishing up my teaching certification here in Pennsylvania. I want to move to Kentucky once my certification is finished. My heart is pretty set on it so I don’t want to be convinced not to move with comments like “Kentucky Republicans hate teachers”; or things like that. Just want answers to my questions. If there are any teachers in this sub you might be especially helpful.

I’m in a bit of a unique situation. I did my Bachelors in History (it’s complicated but my college didn’t offer education as a major, but there was an education program where you could take education classes, but you had to major in something else) and then I pursued a Master’s in Education. Both were at universities here in Pennsylvania. However, I never student taught in undergraduate or master’s so I never received my Instructional certification. So I’m in the kind of unique situation where I already have a Master’s degree but don’t have a certification.

I’m enrolled in a certification only program at a third university here in Pennsylvania where I’ll have to take three classes this summer, followed by two semesters of student teaching in the fall and spring of next year. Apparently such certification only programs are rare in Kentucky. I spoke to the leader of the organization Teach Kentucky and he said the three universities they work with (Asbury, UofL, and Spalding) only have programs to get a master’s along with certification, which doesn’t do me much good since I already have a Masters. He did mention Murray State might have such a certification only program.

I reached out to Murray State and they sent me the application for something called the “Proficiency Evaluation”. Unless I’m misunderstanding what it is, I can just pass the Proficiency Evaluation and get certified in Kentucky without taking anymore classes or student teaching. When I mentioned this to my coworker at my school in Pennsylvania, she told me to just finish my cert in Pennsylvania. Apparently Pennsylvania is known for having very high standards for certifying teachers, so that almost any state will accept a Pennsylvania certification. She said I should just finish my PA certification and then I’d be able to go anywhere. Does anyone know what the Proficiency Evaluation or can comment on her advice.

Like I said, I did speak with an organization called Teach Kentucky that pays teachers to move to Louisville and teach in JCPS. But I’m not sure JCPS and Louisville are where in the state I want to be. I also found a website called makemymove.com that offers stipends for certain professions to move to certain participating cities. Frankfort and Owensboro looked like nice options on there. Can anyone comment on what places might be looking for teachers and paying them to move there?

Sorry I realize most of this post was my background and I guess I only have two actual questions, but thanks if you took the time to read the whole thing.

* Amenities and attractions and such don't matter very much. We both spend the majority of our time in house or in yard and don't ever really go out much besides for normal shopping and such. Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

Anyway thought I would ask reddit because it's such good source of factual info. Any help would be appreciated. Probably won't be moving for 2-3 years but would like to start narrowing things down and at least finding a good area to look in.  Any help from anyone out there who has a nice area or has visited a nice area or any info at all would be awesome.

Thanks in advance!!

Would love some real life info on some places.,"So to make a very long story short (will try to be organized) in the next couple years my mother and I and possibly my brother are looking at selling both our houses in upstate NY (god I hate it here) and moving to Kentucky.

We have looked into a lot of info to pick a state and are pretty set on Kentucky for a number of reasons. That being said we have never moved out of state or looked and it's a bit hard online to sort the reality & truth from the bs and pomp.

I will try to highlight some keypoints of what we are looking for but would appreciate ANY help in narrowing down good cities to look into or just as importantly good cities to AVOID.

&#x200B;

* We are looking for suburbs. This is pretty important. We like our own space and while we don't want full blown country with the nearest hospital or store being an hour away we would like to avoid a street with house after house on top of each other.  Suburbs with a 10-20 minute city away would be great. Would like businesses/stores/doctors/fast food places/jobs etc within a realistic distance away.
* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state. We enjoy all 4 seasons but living currently near buffalo we are so done with snow storms that give us literally feet of lake effect snow. On the flip side not a huge fan of super hot and humid. I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine.

Strong to severe storms will be possible again today before we look to get a break by tomorrow. The Storm Prediction Center has upgraded most of the state to an Enhanced Risk (3/5) in their latest outlook. 

Some showers and storms moved across the state early this morning, but some clearing is taking place now. This will allow for some destabilization and help storms to form later this afternoon and evening. Damaging winds will be the main threat!

Happy Thursday, everyone!  All eyes are on our severe storm threat over the next three days as rounds of showers and storms look to ride along the edge of a building ridge.  This morning a complex of strong to severe storms is pushing across parts of western Kentucky.  Damaging winds have been the main threat thus far.

Later this evening, another round of storms looks to roll across the state.  The location of this round is still in question.  The latest hi-res models are showing this cluster all over the place.  The newest HRRR run shows this impacting more of central and eastern Kentucky but weakening as it pushes into the state. This is definitely something to watch for most of the region.  

More rounds of strong to severe storms look possible Friday and Saturday, and the focus of these rounds should shift to the northeast of our round so far today.  Each MCS's timings, location, and severity are still in question.  Uncertainty is high because of the difficulty of forecasting these Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS's) riding along the edge of a ridge.

I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine. We are NOT looking for a fixer upper or a ""dump"" that needs a ton of work. Probably something  like 2-3 bedrooms 2-3 bathrooms. Does not need to have a huge yard or a ton of land (actually don't want a  TON of land).
* Amenities and attractions and such don't matter very much. We both spend the majority of our time in house or in yard and don't ever really go out much besides for normal shopping and such. Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

Anyway thought I would ask reddit because it's such good source of factual info. Any help would be appreciated. Probably won't be moving for 2-3 years but would like to start narrowing things down and at least finding a good area to look in.  Any help from anyone out there who has a nice area or has visited a nice area or any info at all would be awesome.

Thanks in advance!!

Happy Thursday, everyone!  All eyes are on our severe storm threat over the next three days as rounds of showers and storms look to ride along the edge of a building ridge.  This morning a complex of strong to severe storms is pushing across parts of western Kentucky.  Damaging winds have been the main threat thus far.

Later this evening, another round of storms looks to roll across the state.  The location of this round is still in question.  The latest hi-res models are showing this cluster all over the place.  The newest HRRR run shows this impacting more of central and eastern Kentucky but weakening as it pushes into the state. This is definitely something to watch for most of the region.  

More rounds of strong to severe storms look possible Friday and Saturday, and the focus of these rounds should shift to the northeast of our round so far today.  Each MCS's timings, location, and severity are still in question.  Uncertainty is high because of the difficulty of forecasting these Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS's) riding along the edge of a ridge.

* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state.

627,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, warm, love",Finished Walking Through Kentucky (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

I finished walking through Kentucky a couple days back after taking 4 days to get from Cave-In-Rock, IL to Clarksville, TN. It was the shortest state of the walk, so I don’t feel as though I got to learn as much about the state as other places where I spent more time. However, just like the rest of the country I got to explore a place I had never been to before and meet plenty of kind strangers along the way.

After getting across the Ohio river I hopped onto SR-91, which to my surprise was also the literal Trail of Tears route. I was on SR-91 all the way until Hopkinsville and can’t say it was the best place to walk. From my experience, unlike on US designated highways like US-41, state highways don’t have to provide shoulders. As such, they have usually been some of my least favorite places to walk. However, since the area I was in was amish country, I do think drivers were a little more considerate of sharing the road because of the tendency to see horse and buggies. 

I followed this path through Marion and into Fredonia where I was gifted some free food at the gas station by the clerks. Although the plan was to get a tall boi to celebrate getting into the state, that gas station (the only one in Fredonia) didn’t sell alcohol. That was the first time that had happened in 250+ days of the walk including when I walked through Utah and Kansas. It was something of a shock to me. But I found a place to sleep and started off the next morning. 

Next day I passed through Princeton and had lunch at a Mexican restaurant (typical cuisine for me). I met some nice guys who paid for my meal and told me that the talk of the town was that the football team got busted for drugs (which I assumed to be weed lol). Walked along the rest of the day and pitched my tent at a church with a little covering to protect me from the rain that night.

The third day was me making my way to Hopkinsville. It was a little rainy on the day, but nothing too bad. I got into Hopkinsville and immediately started seeing some strange sights including a street named “Dink Embrys Buttermilk,” a memorial and flag commemorating Jefferson Davis highway (who I learned was born not far for there), and outside of a gun store was a very large replica of Donatello from the Michael Bay adaptation of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Fortunate to pay a visit to the Trail of Tears commemorative park, but the site could definitely use some love, care and support. Eventually I made it to my lovely hosts for the night, Beth and Barry in Hopkinsville, who fed me, let me do some laundry and gave me a warm place to sleep. They even invited me to their son’s wedding, if I can make it down to Atlanta by January 13th. One of the things that I have done along the walk is trade items with the folks that host me that either have some significance to them or their area. So with Barry and Beth, I got to trade a Christmas decoration that was made from one of my hosts near Harrisburg, IL for another Christmas ornament from Hopkinsville Community College, as well as a lucky horseshoe (very Kentucky).

On the last day of walking through Kentucky, I was able to take US-41A, which although busy, had a wide shoulder. Took that highway all the way to Oak Grove and Fort Campbell, the army base for the 101st airborne division. After that I did my little photo op with the “Welcome to Tennessee” sign and crossed into the Volunteer State.

Much like the other states of my walk, cars were the most dangerous and difficult challenge that I faced, corresponding with the lack of infrastructure to accommodate folks outside of cars. This only reaffirmed my conviction to raise money and awareness for AmericaWalks, the leading national walkability and pedestrian advocacy organization. If you would like to create more walkable communities, enable less car dependency, and build a safer Kentucky for those both outside and inside of cars, then please consider donating to and checking out AmericaWalks at AmericaWalks.org. Additionally most of this work happens at the state and local level, so I encourage people to get active and involved locally.

Also like other states all of the folks I met in Kentucky were kind and generous people who helped me out along my journey. My only regret is that I didn’t get the opportunity to meet more of them.

I appreciate you Kentucky and I hope to be back someday to explore other parts of the state.

Sincerely and thanks,
HMR",2023-12-05 22:31:48+00:00

Would love some real life info on some places.,"So to make a very long story short (will try to be organized) in the next couple years my mother and I and possibly my brother are looking at selling both our houses in upstate NY (god I hate it here) and moving to Kentucky.

We have looked into a lot of info to pick a state and are pretty set on Kentucky for a number of reasons. That being said we have never moved out of state or looked and it's a bit hard online to sort the reality & truth from the bs and pomp.

I will try to highlight some keypoints of what we are looking for but would appreciate ANY help in narrowing down good cities to look into or just as importantly good cities to AVOID.

&#x200B;

* We are looking for suburbs. This is pretty important. We like our own space and while we don't want full blown country with the nearest hospital or store being an hour away we would like to avoid a street with house after house on top of each other.  Suburbs with a 10-20 minute city away would be great. Would like businesses/stores/doctors/fast food places/jobs etc within a realistic distance away.
* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state. We enjoy all 4 seasons but living currently near buffalo we are so done with snow storms that give us literally feet of lake effect snow. On the flip side not a huge fan of super hot and humid. I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well.

We have looked into a lot of info to pick a state and are pretty set on Kentucky for a number of reasons. That being said we have never moved out of state or looked and it's a bit hard online to sort the reality & truth from the bs and pomp.

I will try to highlight some keypoints of what we are looking for but would appreciate ANY help in narrowing down good cities to look into or just as importantly good cities to AVOID.

* We are looking for suburbs. This is pretty important. We like our own space and while we don't want full blown country with the nearest hospital or store being an hour away we would like to avoid a street with house after house on top of each other.  Suburbs with a 10-20 minute city away would be great. Would like businesses/stores/doctors/fast food places/jobs etc within a realistic distance away.
* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state. We enjoy all 4 seasons but living currently near buffalo we are so done with snow storms that give us literally feet of lake effect snow. On the flip side not a huge fan of super hot and humid. I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine. We are NOT looking for a fixer upper or a ""dump"" that needs a ton of work. Probably something  like 2-3 bedrooms 2-3 bathrooms. Does not need to have a huge yard or a ton of land (actually don't want a  TON of land).
* Amenities and attractions and such don't matter very much. We both spend the majority of our time in house or in yard and don't ever really go out much besides for normal shopping and such. Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

Anyway thought I would ask reddit because it's such good source of factual info. Any help would be appreciated. Probably won't be moving for 2-3 years but would like to start narrowing things down and at least finding a good area to look in.  Any help from anyone out there who has a nice area or has visited a nice area or any info at all would be awesome.

Happy Thursday, everyone!  All eyes are on our severe storm threat over the next three days as rounds of showers and storms look to ride along the edge of a building ridge.  This morning a complex of strong to severe storms is pushing across parts of western Kentucky.  Damaging winds have been the main threat thus far.

Later this evening, another round of storms looks to roll across the state.  The location of this round is still in question.  The latest hi-res models are showing this cluster all over the place.  The newest HRRR run shows this impacting more of central and eastern Kentucky but weakening as it pushes into the state. This is definitely something to watch for most of the region.  

More rounds of strong to severe storms look possible Friday and Saturday, and the focus of these rounds should shift to the northeast of our round so far today.  Each MCS's timings, location, and severity are still in question.  Uncertainty is high because of the difficulty of forecasting these Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS's) riding along the edge of a ridge.

666,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"weather, sunshine, love",Where should we live?," 

My partner and I are moving from Denver, CO as soon as I finish grad school and are looking for our next home. Here's a little bit about us and what we're ideally looking for (edit: I realize this is idealistic, and we're ready to make some compromises as needed):

\-I'll be working as a therapist & would love to have good opportunities for jobs with decent pay. I'm finishing a very long grad program in May!

\-My partner has recently started working as a paralegal

\-we're both pretty left-leaning politically and would like to have at least a small community of like-minded people wherever we live. Big on mutual aid. We don't need to be in a totally blue area, but also don't want to get run out of town for believing in climate change.

\-somewhere with some art, music, culture, cool stuff, maybe a little grungy

\-looking for somewhere green! We want to have a garden with a somewhat decent and would love access to other produce. This is a BIG DEAL to me. I grew up in AZ and they are steadily running out of water. I want to live somewhere where this isn't a major concern.

\-ideally somewhere that doesn't get TOO cold or TOO snowy, but we're coming from Denver, so we can handle some. This means I want to avoid a place where it rarely gets above 20 in the winter or it heavy snow stays all winter long. Were used to temps 20-50 all winter and snow of 1/8in-2 feet several times a month. My friends' stories about the midwest changed my perception of what cold actually means.

\-also somewhere that isn't wildly hot. I lived in Phoenix for awhile, and that was too hot. Denver gets into the 100s sometimes and it's not fun, but manageable.

\-sunshine - I don't need anywhere as sunny as Denver, but I'd love to see the sun at least a few times a month in the winter.

\-accessible hiking/biking/camping. The southwest has an excess of free public lands that we've gotten used to.

\-affordable! We're hoping to buy a house for under $400k with a decent yard. If we could get acreage in that price, that would be incredible.

\-safety/low crime is important to us at this point. We'll be starting a family in the next five years, so also decent schools.

\-ideally, we'd like to live in a smaller town (under 100k people) and could be very small (under 5k), if it's within 30 min of a bigger town/city where we could access all the necessities. Would love to be able to walk to some basics, but still have space.

Clarification:

I grew up in a town of 50k people and that was WAY big enough to live in without any other city nearby. My partner grew up in a town of 1500 with some real basics. There was a bigger city (200k) within 30 minutes. Both of these are great.

My dad lives in rural florida (not even in a town) and it's 20 minutes to the closest business (a gas station), and another 15 to the closest town of like 2,000 people. For them to buy most necessities, they have to drive an hour to Wal-mart. I'm not interested in that level of rural.",2023-01-15 17:40:12+00:00

My partner and I are moving from Denver, CO as soon as I finish grad school and are looking for our next home. Here's a little bit about us and what we're ideally looking for (edit: I realize this is idealistic, and we're ready to make some compromises as needed):

\-I'll be working as a therapist & would love to have good opportunities for jobs with decent pay. I'm finishing a very long grad program in May!

\-My partner has recently started working as a paralegal

\-we're both pretty left-leaning politically and would like to have at least a small community of like-minded people wherever we live. Big on mutual aid. We don't need to be in a totally blue area, but also don't want to get run out of town for believing in climate change.

\-somewhere with some art, music, culture, cool stuff, maybe a little grungy

\-looking for somewhere green! We want to have a garden with a somewhat decent and would love access to other produce. This is a BIG DEAL to me. I grew up in AZ and they are steadily running out of water. I want to live somewhere where this isn't a major concern.

\-ideally somewhere that doesn't get TOO cold or TOO snowy, but we're coming from Denver, so we can handle some. This means I want to avoid a place where it rarely gets above 20 in the winter or it heavy snow stays all winter long. Were used to temps 20-50 all winter and snow of 1/8in-2 feet several times a month. My friends' stories about the midwest changed my perception of what cold actually means.

\-also somewhere that isn't wildly hot. I lived in Phoenix for awhile, and that was too hot. Denver gets into the 100s sometimes and it's not fun, but manageable.

\-sunshine - I don't need anywhere as sunny as Denver, but I'd love to see the sun at least a few times a month in the winter.

\-accessible hiking/biking/camping. The southwest has an excess of free public lands that we've gotten used to.

\-affordable! We're hoping to buy a house for under $400k with a decent yard. If we could get acreage in that price, that would be incredible.

\-safety/low crime is important to us at this point. We'll be starting a family in the next five years, so also decent schools.

\-ideally, we'd like to live in a smaller town (under 100k people) and could be very small (under 5k), if it's within 30 min of a bigger town/city where we could access all the necessities. Would love to be able to walk to some basics, but still have space.

Clarification:

I grew up in a town of 50k people and that was WAY big enough to live in without any other city nearby. My partner grew up in a town of 1500 with some real basics. There was a bigger city (200k) within 30 minutes. Both of these are great.

My dad lives in rural florida (not even in a town) and it's 20 minutes to the closest business (a gas station), and another 15 to the closest town of like 2,000 people. For them to buy most necessities, they have to drive an hour to Wal-mart. I'm not interested in that level of rural.",2023-01-15 17:40:12+00:00

677,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, love",Looking to move to Kentucky. Would love some real life info on some places.,"So to make a very long story short (will try to be organized) in the next couple years my mother and I and possibly my brother are looking at selling both our houses in upstate NY (god I hate it here) and moving to Kentucky.

We have looked into a lot of info to pick a state and are pretty set on Kentucky for a number of reasons. That being said we have never moved out of state or looked and it's a bit hard online to sort the reality & truth from the bs and pomp.

I will try to highlight some keypoints of what we are looking for but would appreciate ANY help in narrowing down good cities to look into or just as importantly good cities to AVOID.

&#x200B;

* We are looking for suburbs. This is pretty important. We like our own space and while we don't want full blown country with the nearest hospital or store being an hour away we would like to avoid a street with house after house on top of each other.  Suburbs with a 10-20 minute city away would be great. Would like businesses/stores/doctors/fast food places/jobs etc within a realistic distance away.
* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state. We enjoy all 4 seasons but living currently near buffalo we are so done with snow storms that give us literally feet of lake effect snow. On the flip side not a huge fan of super hot and humid. I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine. We are NOT looking for a fixer upper or a ""dump"" that needs a ton of work. Probably something  like 2-3 bedrooms 2-3 bathrooms. Does not need to have a huge yard or a ton of land (actually don't want a  TON of land).
* Amenities and attractions and such don't matter very much. We both spend the majority of our time in house or in yard and don't ever really go out much besides for normal shopping and such. Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

Anyway thought I would ask reddit because it's such good source of factual info. Any help would be appreciated. Probably won't be moving for 2-3 years but would like to start narrowing things down and at least finding a good area to look in.  Any help from anyone out there who has a nice area or has visited a nice area or any info at all would be awesome.

Thanks in advance!!

This is my next stop on my way to visiting the subreddits of every state in the United States, every province and territory of Canada, and every country across the rest of the world.

This isn't for any sort of website or blog. It's for my own personal edification, in case I'm ever able to make it to all of these great places. I'm hoping I'll be able to talk with some friendly people along the way in finding out about the most interesting points of interest in each place (or, at least, please be friendlier than [r/Arizona](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arizona/) who permanently banned me for asking this exact same question).

I have done a little bit of searching on my own already and have a small list of places I think would be interesting to see, but I would love to know more about what your state has to offer, and I thought it would be great to get those recommendations from people who live there. I know there has to be more than what the travel websites have to offer.

I'm looking for any sort of point of interest, whether its a cool State Park, a monument, memorial, interesting building, historical point of interest, something offbeat and silly, scenic nature, or even a recurring event.

Here's what I have so far, and I'm hoping you can add to it!

1. Mammoth Cave
2. Churchill Downs
3. Cumberland Falls State Resort Park
4. Louisville Belle
5. Natural Bridge
6. The Versailles Castle
7. Fort Knox
8. The Shaker Village 
9. The Pinnacles

I'm also doing a little food section, as well. From what I've uncovered, the four essential foods I should try in your state are the following. Let me know if this sounds right:

1. Hot Brown
2. Derby Pie
3. Bourbon Balls
4. Mint Julep ",2024-03-27 01:48:43+00:00
680,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, hot, love",Tobacco Patch,"Here is a photo of a Pendleton County tobacco patch. Like so many good Kentuckians, I was raised pullin', settin', hoein', toppin', cuttin', housin', strippin', bailin', and sellin', this ole sticky weed.  Looking back, I thank God; for it taught me many life lessons. 
     
     First lesson was, family is important. While wondering through the seasons of my youth I remember, everyone worked together to harvest a good crop, of which we could be proud.  We didn't have the best tractor or nicest stripping room, (actually we had to borrow both tractor and stripping room a few times) but we appreciated what we had.  The hours spent walking behind mom, grandma and my aunts on the setter or next to them in the stripping room, are precious memories which I'll always cherish.  The discussions were always as hot as the winter wood stove, except when a UK basketball game would be on the radio. Talking was then only allowed during commercials breaks. 

     Secondly, I learned that everyone must pull the weight, or the burden will become too heavy. As a child, we played in the fields while the adults toiled, but as we got older, tasks were assigned. At first they were simple; like pick up the fallen leaves, or cut and tie new bail strings. Then as age sold us out and we grew older, our jobs got harder. As a smaller and skinnier man, I could climb to the top of the barn faster than most, while housing. It was hot up there, but you only had to handle half of the sticks and dirt wouldn't fall in your eyes or on your neck like being the ""middle man"". Oh, how proud I was to finally get my own spear and knife and be placed in a row with the men! Though, after about fifteen minutes I wanted to be back with the kids again! It took the whole group to make it work. Today, it's an honor to look back and be apart of it.

     Last lesson is, hard work pays off. Tobacco was the most difficult task that I can remember. My grandfather likes to state in his infinite wisdom, ""it's a 13 month a year crop!"" I've heard stories about the time before the pull-behind setters, and I remember the meticulousness of rolling back the white canvas and pulling weeds out of the tobacco beds and the pain of kneeling for eternity on a 2X10 suspended across some cinder blocks. It was a difficult work to do, but now I know why my family did it; Christmas. You see, that's what they would buy our gifts with. That ladies and gentlemen, is the true definition of love, to labor for a harvest and then give it away!

    It was in this dirt and dust where lessons about respect, honesty, and service were reiterated and traditions/heritage were discussed with reverence. Our story of a people and blood-line was told and family ties were strengthened. I worked the ground because my grandpa did, and his grandpa did before him, all the way back. We did it because we loved one another. While time and death may separate us, every time I see a picture like this, my heart wells with the love that I received, from working in this damned old weed! Thank you Lord, for putting us together as a family, and sticking us on that ridge, in our little farm community, and giving us our abilities to work.",2023-08-21 13:57:02+00:00

685,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, love",Moving From OR to KY: Is This a Match?,"My husband and I are in our early 30’s looking to cash in on our equity from our pricey Oregon area and are thinking about moving to central Kentucky/Bluegrass region. We are planning our first trip for February. We currently live in a rural county, a few miles outside of the nicest, richest city in our county with a population of 25k. We are within 30 minutes to several similar sized cities/towns with shopping or restaurant options. We have a small several acre property and keep small livestock. My husband and I both own own businesses and work from home. We make around $160k combined per year currently, and would like to steer clear from areas known for drugs or crime as we hope to start a family. We like a country, slower paced, less populated way of life but still like to go out to eat and meet at coffee shops with friends, etc. every now and again and don’t mind driving 30ish minutes to do so. We are mostly homebodies, love walking/hiking, country drives, kayaking, ATVs, we are interested in horses, keeping livestock animals, and love our dogs. 
 
Why we’re attracted to Kentucky:
1.     Affordability
2.     Land with seemingly decent looking/sized houses with shops and barns (you have to pay around $1m for that in our current area)
3.     In the Bluegrass region, properties seem close-ish to the two main cities for entertainment, connections, etc. 
4.     4 seasons
5.     Even just a tiny bit of snow? We get get zero now, so any at all would be neat
6.     People are nice? We read it’s a highly rated area for “nice” folks. Oregon, not so much...
7.     Horses
8.     Near lots of different states and areas; the midwest, the south, the east coast 
 
Things we’re worried about:
1.     Humid summers; our summers are 0%
2.     Tornadoes! More insight/info on living alongside these would be so helpful
3.     Snakes; only ever see the occasional garden snake here now
 
If anyone has opinions on if Kentucky seems like a good fit for us and has any additional info, education, or insights into anything regarding Kentucky, but also about our concern points, that would be so helpful! Thank you!",2024-01-11 02:49:16+00:00

687,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, love",Looking to move to Kentucky. Would love some real life info on some places.,"So to make a very long story short (will try to be organized) in the next couple years my mother and I and possibly my brother are looking at selling both our houses in upstate NY (god I hate it here) and moving to Kentucky.

We have looked into a lot of info to pick a state and are pretty set on Kentucky for a number of reasons. That being said we have never moved out of state or looked and it's a bit hard online to sort the reality & truth from the bs and pomp.

I will try to highlight some keypoints of what we are looking for but would appreciate ANY help in narrowing down good cities to look into or just as importantly good cities to AVOID.

&#x200B;

* We are looking for suburbs. This is pretty important. We like our own space and while we don't want full blown country with the nearest hospital or store being an hour away we would like to avoid a street with house after house on top of each other.  Suburbs with a 10-20 minute city away would be great. Would like businesses/stores/doctors/fast food places/jobs etc within a realistic distance away.
* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state. We enjoy all 4 seasons but living currently near buffalo we are so done with snow storms that give us literally feet of lake effect snow. On the flip side not a huge fan of super hot and humid. I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).  We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine. We are NOT looking for a fixer upper or a ""dump"" that needs a ton of work. Probably something  like 2-3 bedrooms 2-3 bathrooms. Does not need to have a huge yard or a ton of land (actually don't want a  TON of land).
* Amenities and attractions and such don't matter very much. We both spend the majority of our time in house or in yard and don't ever really go out much besides for normal shopping and such. Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

Anyway thought I would ask reddit because it's such good source of factual info. Any help would be appreciated. Probably won't be moving for 2-3 years but would like to start narrowing things down and at least finding a good area to look in.  Any help from anyone out there who has a nice area or has visited a nice area or any info at all would be awesome.

Thanks in advance!!

695,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, summer, hate",Questions about moving to Kentucky as a teacher ,"I’m currently finishing up my teaching certification here in Pennsylvania. I want to move to Kentucky once my certification is finished. My heart is pretty set on it so I don’t want to be convinced not to move with comments like “Kentucky Republicans hate teachers”; or things like that. Just want answers to my questions. If there are any teachers in this sub you might be especially helpful.

I’m in a bit of a unique situation. I did my Bachelors in History (it’s complicated but my college didn’t offer education as a major, but there was an education program where you could take education classes, but you had to major in something else) and then I pursued a Master’s in Education. Both were at universities here in Pennsylvania. However, I never student taught in undergraduate or master’s so I never received my Instructional certification. So I’m in the kind of unique situation where I already have a Master’s degree but don’t have a certification.

I’m enrolled in a certification only program at a third university here in Pennsylvania where I’ll have to take three classes this summer, followed by two semesters of student teaching in the fall and spring of next year. Apparently such certification only programs are rare in Kentucky. I spoke to the leader of the organization Teach Kentucky and he said the three universities they work with (Asbury, UofL, and Spalding) only have programs to get a master’s along with certification, which doesn’t do me much good since I already have a Masters. He did mention Murray State might have such a certification only program.

I reached out to Murray State and they sent me the application for something called the “Proficiency Evaluation”. Unless I’m misunderstanding what it is, I can just pass the Proficiency Evaluation and get certified in Kentucky without taking anymore classes or student teaching. When I mentioned this to my coworker at my school in Pennsylvania, she told me to just finish my cert in Pennsylvania. Apparently Pennsylvania is known for having very high standards for certifying teachers, so that almost any state will accept a Pennsylvania certification. She said I should just finish my PA certification and then I’d be able to go anywhere. Does anyone know what the Proficiency Evaluation or can comment on her advice.

Like I said, I did speak with an organization called Teach Kentucky that pays teachers to move to Louisville and teach in JCPS. But I’m not sure JCPS and Louisville are where in the state I want to be. I also found a website called makemymove.com that offers stipends for certain professions to move to certain participating cities. Frankfort and Owensboro looked like nice options on there. Can anyone comment on what places might be looking for teachers and paying them to move there?

Sorry I realize most of this post was my background and I guess I only have two actual questions, but thanks if you took the time to read the whole thing.

707,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, warm, love",Finished Walking Through Kentucky (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all,

I finished walking through Kentucky a couple days back after taking 4 days to get from Cave-In-Rock, IL to Clarksville, TN. It was the shortest state of the walk, so I don’t feel as though I got to learn as much about the state as other places where I spent more time. However, just like the rest of the country I got to explore a place I had never been to before and meet plenty of kind strangers along the way.

After getting across the Ohio river I hopped onto SR-91, which to my surprise was also the literal Trail of Tears route. I was on SR-91 all the way until Hopkinsville and can’t say it was the best place to walk. From my experience, unlike on US designated highways like US-41, state highways don’t have to provide shoulders. As such, they have usually been some of my least favorite places to walk. However, since the area I was in was amish country, I do think drivers were a little more considerate of sharing the road because of the tendency to see horse and buggies. 

I followed this path through Marion and into Fredonia where I was gifted some free food at the gas station by the clerks. Although the plan was to get a tall boi to celebrate getting into the state, that gas station (the only one in Fredonia) didn’t sell alcohol. That was the first time that had happened in 250+ days of the walk including when I walked through Utah and Kansas. It was something of a shock to me. But I found a place to sleep and started off the next morning. 

Next day I passed through Princeton and had lunch at a Mexican restaurant (typical cuisine for me). I met some nice guys who paid for my meal and told me that the talk of the town was that the football team got busted for drugs (which I assumed to be weed lol). Walked along the rest of the day and pitched my tent at a church with a little covering to protect me from the rain that night.

The third day was me making my way to Hopkinsville. It was a little rainy on the day, but nothing too bad. I got into Hopkinsville and immediately started seeing some strange sights including a street named “Dink Embrys Buttermilk,” a memorial and flag commemorating Jefferson Davis highway (who I learned was born not far for there), and outside of a gun store was a very large replica of Donatello from the Michael Bay adaptation of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Fortunate to pay a visit to the Trail of Tears commemorative park, but the site could definitely use some love, care and support. Eventually I made it to my lovely hosts for the night, Beth and Barry in Hopkinsville, who fed me, let me do some laundry and gave me a warm place to sleep. They even invited me to their son’s wedding, if I can make it down to Atlanta by January 13th. One of the things that I have done along the walk is trade items with the folks that host me that either have some significance to them or their area. So with Barry and Beth, I got to trade a Christmas decoration that was made from one of my hosts near Harrisburg, IL for another Christmas ornament from Hopkinsville Community College, as well as a lucky horseshoe (very Kentucky).

On the last day of walking through Kentucky, I was able to take US-41A, which although busy, had a wide shoulder. Took that highway all the way to Oak Grove and Fort Campbell, the army base for the 101st airborne division. After that I did my little photo op with the “Welcome to Tennessee” sign and crossed into the Volunteer State.

Much like the other states of my walk, cars were the most dangerous and difficult challenge that I faced, corresponding with the lack of infrastructure to accommodate folks outside of cars. This only reaffirmed my conviction to raise money and awareness for AmericaWalks, the leading national walkability and pedestrian advocacy organization. If you would like to create more walkable communities, enable less car dependency, and build a safer Kentucky for those both outside and inside of cars, then please consider donating to and checking out AmericaWalks at AmericaWalks.org. Additionally most of this work happens at the state and local level, so I encourage people to get active and involved locally.

Also like other states all of the folks I met in Kentucky were kind and generous people who helped me out along my journey. My only regret is that I didn’t get the opportunity to meet more of them.

I appreciate you Kentucky and I hope to be back someday to explore other parts of the state.

Sincerely and thanks,
HMR",2023-12-05 22:31:48+00:00

We are comparably NOT looking for something similar to whatever city we end up moving too.
* Decent cost of living + house price. We are far from being wealthy but do have 2 houses we will be selling to give us some money as well. Looking somewhere in the neighborhood of like $200k-300k for a nice decent size house.  Maybe even a bit more as needed or ofc less would be fine. We are NOT looking for a fixer upper or a ""dump"" that needs a ton of work. Probably something  like 2-3 bedrooms 2-3 bathrooms. Does not need to have a huge yard or a ton of land (actually don't want a  TON of land).
* Amenities and attractions and such don't matter very much. We both spend the majority of our time in house or in yard and don't ever really go out much besides for normal shopping and such. Not saying there can't be cool things to do out there but not really a huge selling point for where we looking to move.

Anyway thought I would ask reddit because it's such good source of factual info. Any help would be appreciated. Probably won't be moving for 2-3 years but would like to start narrowing things down and at least finding a good area to look in.  Any help from anyone out there who has a nice area or has visited a nice area or any info at all would be awesome.

Thanks in advance!!

710,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, warm, enjoy",Help me save my vacation on a Monday in Kentucky,"My wife and I will be driving from Nashville to Pewee Valley this morning (Monday 8/5). My wife doesn't like bourbon (I have two tours scheduled for tomorrow). Many of the things she would've liked are closed on Monday (Bell Witch Caves are closed, Mammoth Caves are sold out, Fort Knox museum is closed, Yew Dell botanical gardens are closed, etc). It's also very warm and humid so things like hiking are a bit challenging at the moment. 

Help me find a few things that my wife might enjoy (history, nature, anything except drinking) so that she doesn't feel like a prisoner on our vacation.

EDIT: Thanks all for the recommendations. On Monday (the day in question) we ended up doing the Lost River Cave, then heading to Mammoth Cave and doing the short .5 mile hike to the Old Tour Guide gravesite. We checked into our Airbnb then we had dinner at Old School NY Pizza in Norton Commons, which was great for multiple reasons - tasty pizza (leftovers for the next day or two), good and cheap bourbon selection, and the little community that seemed too good to be true (must be a cult). On Tuesday we did the scheduled bourbon tours but also had breakfast at Mammy's in Bardstown, and stopped at Goodwill between tours to get some cheap Kentucky-related shirts (without paying retail/gift shop prices). Wife is always happy with a thrift store stop. We both really enjoyed the Maker's Mark tour and ended the evening with some BBQ from Jucy's Smokehouse.

712,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, warm, enjoy",Looking to move to Kentucky. Would love some real life info on some places.,"So to make a very long story short (will try to be organized) in the next couple years my mother and I and possibly my brother are looking at selling both our houses in upstate NY (god I hate it here) and moving to Kentucky.

We have looked into a lot of info to pick a state and are pretty set on Kentucky for a number of reasons. That being said we have never moved out of state or looked and it's a bit hard online to sort the reality & truth from the bs and pomp.

I will try to highlight some keypoints of what we are looking for but would appreciate ANY help in narrowing down good cities to look into or just as importantly good cities to AVOID.

&#x200B;

* We are looking for suburbs. This is pretty important. We like our own space and while we don't want full blown country with the nearest hospital or store being an hour away we would like to avoid a street with house after house on top of each other.  Suburbs with a 10-20 minute city away would be great. Would like businesses/stores/doctors/fast food places/jobs etc within a realistic distance away.
* Weather I would assume is mostly the same in most of the state. We enjoy all 4 seasons but living currently near buffalo we are so done with snow storms that give us literally feet of lake effect snow. On the flip side not a huge fan of super hot and humid. I know most of kentucky seems to be rather warm especially during summer months but this is expected just don't want super humid on top of it.
* Good neighborhood/city is vitally important. While Kentucky seems to have great reviews for the state as whole.... I don't know how to explicitly find info of places to avoid with bad neighborhoods or high crime rate.  If anyone knows NY at all up here we live in a pretty nice low crime no issues city but there are a couple cities within like 20-30 minutes from us that are pretty terrible places. Very low class, higher crime, bad neighborhood type stuff (Buffalo and Niagara Falls though they both have better parts and worse parts).

715,Kentucky,IDENTIFIER-WEATHER-ATTITUDE,"temperature, sunshine, love",Where should we live?," 

My partner and I are moving from Denver, CO as soon as I finish grad school and are looking for our next home. Here's a little bit about us and what we're ideally looking for (edit: I realize this is idealistic, and we're ready to make some compromises as needed):

\-I'll be working as a therapist & would love to have good opportunities for jobs with decent pay. I'm finishing a very long grad program in May!

\-My partner has recently started working as a paralegal

\-we're both pretty left-leaning politically and would like to have at least a small community of like-minded people wherever we live. Big on mutual aid. We don't need to be in a totally blue area, but also don't want to get run out of town for believing in climate change.

\-somewhere with some art, music, culture, cool stuff, maybe a little grungy

\-looking for somewhere green! We want to have a garden with a somewhat decent and would love access to other produce. This is a BIG DEAL to me. I grew up in AZ and they are steadily running out of water. I want to live somewhere where this isn't a major concern.

\-ideally somewhere that doesn't get TOO cold or TOO snowy, but we're coming from Denver, so we can handle some. This means I want to avoid a place where it rarely gets above 20 in the winter or it heavy snow stays all winter long. Were used to temps 20-50 all winter and snow of 1/8in-2 feet several times a month. My friends' stories about the midwest changed my perception of what cold actually means.

\-also somewhere that isn't wildly hot. I lived in Phoenix for awhile, and that was too hot. Denver gets into the 100s sometimes and it's not fun, but manageable.

\-sunshine - I don't need anywhere as sunny as Denver, but I'd love to see the sun at least a few times a month in the winter.

\-accessible hiking/biking/camping. The southwest has an excess of free public lands that we've gotten used to.

\-affordable! We're hoping to buy a house for under $400k with a decent yard. If we could get acreage in that price, that would be incredible.

\-safety/low crime is important to us at this point. We'll be starting a family in the next five years, so also decent schools.

\-ideally, we'd like to live in a smaller town (under 100k people) and could be very small (under 5k), if it's within 30 min of a bigger town/city where we could access all the necessities. Would love to be able to walk to some basics, but still have space.

Clarification:

I grew up in a town of 50k people and that was WAY big enough to live in without any other city nearby. My partner grew up in a town of 1500 with some real basics. There was a bigger city (200k) within 30 minutes. Both of these are great.

My dad lives in rural florida (not even in a town) and it's 20 minutes to the closest business (a gas station), and another 15 to the closest town of like 2,000 people. For them to buy most necessities, they have to drive an hour to Wal-mart. I'm not interested in that level of rural.",2023-01-15 17:40:12+00:00
